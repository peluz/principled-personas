"First, let's figure out how many eggs Janet has left after she uses some for herself and baking.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.
She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends every day.

So, the total number of eggs used is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg.

So, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"To find the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, let's break it down step by step.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since it needs 2 bolts of blue fiber, half of that would be:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt of white fiber}
   \]

3. To find the total number of bolts of fiber needed, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
   \[
   2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
   \]

So, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repairs) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the total cost before the increase and add it to the total cost.

The total cost before the increase is the purchase price plus the repairs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

Next, we subtract the total cost from the new value to find the profit:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. First, calculate the total distance James runs in one session. Since he runs 3 sprints and each sprint is 60 meters, we multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint:
   \[
   3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. Next, since James does this 3 times a week, we multiply the distance he runs in one session by the number of sessions per week:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

So, the total distance James runs in a week is:
\[
540 \text{ meters}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs in a day. Since each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken gets:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount of feed needed for 20 chickens in a day. If each chicken needs 9 cups of feed, then for 20 chickens, the total feed needed is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Now, we know that Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

So, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the first glass:**
   - The cost of one glass is $5.

2. **Determine the cost of the second glass:**
   - The second glass costs 60% of $5.
   - \( 60\% \) of $5 is calculated as \( 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost for pairs of glasses:**
   - Each pair (one at $5 and one at $3) costs \( 5 + 3 = 8 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the number of pairs in 16 glasses:**
   - Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, and each pair consists of 2 glasses, the number of pairs is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost for 8 pairs:**
   - The total cost for 8 pairs is \( 8 \times 8 = 64 \) dollars.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay \(\boxed{64}\) dollars for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of sheep each city has in terms of Seattle's sheep.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep:**
   To find the total number of sheep, we add the sheep from Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

So, the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together is **260**."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = \( 0.40 \times 200 \) GB = 80 GB

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \( \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \)

6. **Add the total time for the download:**
   - Total time = 60 minutes (first 40%) + 20 minutes (update) + 60 minutes (remaining 120%) = 140 minutes

So, the total time it takes to download the file is **140 minutes**."
"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels to the point he turns around.

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

This means John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.

Next, we need to determine how far John travels back towards home in the 4 hours he spends trying to get home.

John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After this, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. The total time he has is 4 hours, and he has already spent 2.5 hours (2 hours in traffic and 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph):
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 4 \, \text{hours} - 2.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, the distance he covers in the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's add up the distances he has covered towards home:
\[ \text{Total distance towards home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he was initially 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours.

1. **Regular Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay Calculation:**
   - Overtime is paid at 1.2 times the regular hourly rate.
   - Overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12/hour.
   - Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings Calculation:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay.
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

**Final Answer:**
Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times the first month.
   - So, \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) downloads.

3. **Third Month:**
   - The downloads reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - First, calculate 30% of 180: \( 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \).
   - Then, subtract this from 180: \( 180 - 54 = 126 \) downloads.

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   - Add the downloads from each month: \( 60 + 180 + 126 \).

Now, let's do the addition:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is **366**."
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry separately and then add them together.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \) dollars.

Now, we add the costs together to find the total cost:
\[ 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 \]

So, the total cost is **694** dollars."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the revenue from selling lemons each year is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Profit per Year**: The net profit each year is the revenue from selling lemons minus the annual expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take **12 years** before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are enrolled in contemporary dance. This leaves us with:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Next, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are enrolled in jazz dance. This leaves us with:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

These 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance:

\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Final numerical answer:
60%"
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Calculation:**
   - Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Increase in value: \( 5000 \times \frac{2.5}{100} = 5000 \times 0.025 = 125 \)
   - New value of jewelry: \( 5000 + 125 = 5125 \)

2. **Electronic Gadgets Calculation:**
   - Initial value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Increase in value: \( 8000 \times \frac{1.2}{100} = 8000 \times 0.012 = 96 \)
   - New value of electronic gadgets: \( 8000 + 96 = 8096 \)

Now, we compare the new values:
- New value of jewelry: $5125
- New value of electronic gadgets: $8096

The electronic gadgets will yield a higher value at the end of the month. The profit from the electronic gadgets is:
\[ 8096 - 8000 = 96 \]

Therefore, the profit from choosing the electronic gadgets is:
\[ \boxed{96} \]"

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Now, we add her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many eggs Claire uses in a week. Since she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week, she uses:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks:

\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. The orange drink is two-thirds water, so:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume is:

\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water in remaining orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from both the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters:

\[ \text{Total water} = 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price. This is because a 25% discount means he paid 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price.

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Since $19.50 is 75% of \( P \), we can write the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the boxes of pizza.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\]

Marie paid a total of $50. To find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza, we subtract the total cost of the other items from $50:
\[50 - 33 = 17\]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\]

So, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza."

So, Mishka spent a total of **243 dollars** on all the clothing items."
"First, let's determine how many servings Cynthia eats in 60 days. Since she eats one serving every night, in 60 days she will eat:

\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Each carton contains 15 servings. So, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost. Each carton costs $4.00, so for 4 cartons, the cost will be:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, let's break down the information given:

1. Henry's total trip is 60 miles.
2. He first stopped after 20 miles.
3. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can calculate the distance from the start to his second stop by subtracting 15 miles from the total trip distance:

\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

This means his second stop was at the 45-mile mark.

Now, to find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:

\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

**Final Answer:**
25 miles"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the high heels:**
   - One pair of heels costs $33.
   - The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the two pairs of high heels:**
   - The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \(33 + 66 = 99\) dollars.

3. **Relate the cost of the boots to the cost of the high heels:**
   - The problem states that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, the cost of the boots is \(99 + 5 = 104\) dollars.

So, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age, and then determine Allen's age 10 years from now.

1. **Identify the ratio and total age:**
   - The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
   - Their total age is 162.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\).
   - The sum of their ages is \(7x + 11x = 162\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   7x + 11x = 162
   \]
   \[
   18x = 162
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{162}{18}
   \]
   \[
   x = 9
   \]

4. **Find Allen's current age:**
   - Allen's age is \(11x\).
   \[
   11x = 11 \times 9 = 99
   \]

5. **Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now:**
   - Allen's age 10 years from now will be \(99 + 10\).
   \[
   99 + 10 = 109
   \]

**Final Answer:**
Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"First, let's find out how many jelly beans each friend guessed:

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of 80. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, let's add these guesses together and then find the average:

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses (which is 3):

\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

So, the average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can break the problem down into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the daily care time for one dog:**
   Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.

2. **Calculate the daily care time for all 10 dogs:**
   Since John has 10 dogs, we multiply the daily care time for one dog by the number of dogs:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly care time:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily care time by 7:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{35}

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

**Final Answer:**
70"
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, Aaron has 5 more than 20 jewels:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"First, we need to determine how many points Mike scored in the second 20 minutes. We know he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes and that in the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points.

To find 25% of 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point} \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, we add the points from both halves of the game to find the total points scored:
\[ 4 \text{ points} + 5 \text{ points} = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, in 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. We do this by dividing 60 by 4:

\[ 60 \div 4 = 15 \]

This means Terry gets 15 sets of 4 yogurts. Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \]

So, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20, so:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

John spends $160 on video games and has $5 left. This means the total amount of money he had initially was:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \]

Since he initially had $165 and he got $195 from selling the lego sets, we need to find out how many lego sets he still has. The difference between the money he got from selling the lego sets and the money he had initially is:

\[ 195 - 165 = 30 \]

This $30 is the amount he would have if he sold 30 lego sets at $15 each. Since he originally had 13 lego sets and sold enough to get $195, and he has 30 lego sets worth of money left, he must have sold all his lego sets and then some. But since he only had 13 lego sets, he must have sold all of them and still have the 30 lego sets worth of money left as unaccounted for in the initial transaction.

Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his speed in miles per hour. First, let's break down the information given:

1. John runs a total of 60 miles a week.
2. He runs 3 days a week.
3. He runs 3 hours on the first day.
4. He runs half as much time on the other two days.

Let's calculate the time he runs on the other two days:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day, so he runs for \(3 \div 2 = 1.5\) hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time he runs in a week:
- Time on the first day: 3 hours
- Time on the second day: 1.5 hours
- Time on the third day: 1.5 hours

Total time in a week = \(3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6\) hours

Next, we need to find his speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, her walking speed is four times slower than her running speed:
\[ 6 \text{ miles per hour} \div 4 = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance running:
\[ 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To find out how old Brandon's iPhone is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

"First, we need to determine how far Polly can throw the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. According to the problem, when Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone.

When Polly is not holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. Therefore, when holding the gemstone, she can throw it:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to subtract the dragon's reach from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Final answer:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of pie pieces Grandma Jones initially had. She baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine how many calories are left for the day:
2000 calories (daily target) - 1800 calories (already consumed) = 200 calories left.

Next, we need to find out how many calories one serving of chips contains:
250 calories per serving.

Now, we calculate how many servings of chips can be eaten with the remaining 200 calories:
200 calories ÷ 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since each 300g bag contains 5 servings, we can find out how many grams correspond to 0.8 servings:
0.8 servings × 300g per bag ÷ 5 servings per bag = 48 grams.

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips. 

**Final Answer:**
48 grams"
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the beeswax and wicks:**
   - The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using some at work, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

First, we need to determine how many Post-it notes she had before she used them at work. This can be calculated by adding the Post-it notes she had left to the ones she used at work:

\[ 220 \text{ (used at work)} + 23 \text{ (remaining)} = 243 \text{ (total used)} \]

Next, we need to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased. We do this by subtracting the initial number of Post-it notes she had from the total number of Post-it notes she used:

\[ 243 \text{ (total used)} - 80 \text{ (initial)} = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:

\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the wire is \(4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}\).

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained.

So, \(48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces}\).

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's find the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ units} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

So, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM and then use that distance to find out how long it takes him to travel back at 6 mph.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM:**
   - Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
   - He travels from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is 3 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

2. **Calculate the time to travel back:**
   - The distance back is the same, 30 miles.
   - Tom's speed on the way back is 6 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide 7.5 by \( \frac{1}{2} \):

\[ 7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys."

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the maximum weight the bridge can carry.
2. Subtract the weight of the empty truck and the driver from the bridge's weight limit to find out how much weight is available for the boxes.
3. Divide the available weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds.
2. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. So, the available weight for the boxes is:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes, we divide the available weight by the weight of each box:
   \[

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25
- Sour oranges: 2

To find the number of unripe oranges, we calculate 20% of 25:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \]

Now, let's add up all the oranges that are not good:
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 5
- Sour oranges: 2

Total non-good oranges:
\[ 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 \]

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the total number of non-good oranges from the total number of oranges:
\[ 25 - 8 = 17 \]

So, the number of good oranges is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the material and the jeweler's work:

Material cost: $500
Jeweler's cost: $800

Total cost for material and construction: $500 + $800 = $1300

Next, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost to get the brooch insured:

10% of $1300 = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost of the material and construction:

Total cost including insurance: $1300 + $130 = $1430

So, Janet paid a total of $1430."
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the regular annual pension for the first 20 years.
2. Calculate the additional pension she gets after 20 years based on the 5% rule.
3. Add the regular annual pension to the additional pension to get the total annual pension after 30 years.

**Step 1: Regular Annual Pension for the First 20 Years**
Marcy gets a regular annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years.

**Step 2: Additional Pension After 20 Years**
Starting after 20 years, she gets an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension is $50,000, so the additional pension is:
\[ 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

**Step 3: Total Annual Pension After 30 Years**
After 30 years, her total annual pension is the sum of the regular annual pension and the additional pension:
\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

So, the annual pension Marcy will receive after 30 years is:
\[ \boxed{52500} \]"
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Total for the first half: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is reduced by 10%.

   - The new monthly charge is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - Total for the second half: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - Sum of the amounts for the first and second halves: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

The total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is **$1596**."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg).

1. Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas.
2. To find the miles per gallon, we divide the miles traveled by the gallons of gas used:
   \[
   \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
   \]

3. Now, we know her car can travel 25 miles per gallon. Since her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, we can calculate the total distance she can travel on a full tank by multiplying the miles per gallon by the total gallons in the tank:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time he spends on TV and reading in one week is:
\[3 \text{ hours/time} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

Now, to find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys').
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 5 (girls) + 5 (boys) = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 2

Therefore, for each school:
- Total people = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools:
- Total people from all schools = 12 people/school × 4 schools = 48 people

Final numerical answer:
48"
"First, let's find out how many rubies there are. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35
Number of rubies = 175 - 35
Number of rubies = 140

Next, we need to find out how many emeralds there are. Since there are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

Number of emeralds = 2 × Number of rubies
Number of emeralds = 2 × 140
Number of emeralds = 280

Now, to find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
Total number of gems = 175 + 140 + 280
Total number of gems = 595

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"First, let's find out how many boys there are at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 × Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 × 60
Number of boys = 120

Now, let's find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls together:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Given that there are 5 students for every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5:

Number of teachers = Total number of students ÷ 5
Number of teachers = 180 ÷ 5
Number of teachers = 36

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to figure out how much money she earned from her allowance and then subtract that from her total amount of money at the end.

1. Calculate the total amount of money Bailey earned from her allowance:
   - She receives $5 each week.
   - She receives this allowance for 8 weeks.
   - So, the total allowance is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) dollars.

2. Bailey has a total of $100 at the end of 8 weeks. This total includes her initial amount of money plus the $40 she earned from her allowance.

3. To find out how much money Bailey started with, we subtract the total allowance from her final amount:
   - Final amount = Initial amount + Total allowance
   - $100 = Initial amount + $40
   - Initial amount = $100 - $40 = $60

So, Bailey started with $60."
"First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week.

- From Monday to Friday, she teaches 5 classes each day. So, for 5 days, she teaches \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week. Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students is \(33 \times 15 = 495\).

Judy charges $15.00 per student. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes in a week is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\).

"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total money raised from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately, and then add the two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the money raised from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie slice for $3.
- He sells 43 brownies.

So, the total money from brownies is:
\[ 43 \text{ brownies} \times 3 \text{ dollars per brownie} = 129 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the money raised from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake slice for $4.
- He sells 23 slices of cheesecake.

So, the total money from cheesecakes is:
\[ 23 \text{ slices} \times 4 \text{ dollars per slice} = 92 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the money raised from both brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount raised:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ 5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$150 \text{ per cell phone} = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ 5 \times 2\% \times \$150 = 5 \times 0.02 \times 150 = 5 \times 3 = \$15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela will pay is the original cost plus the interest:

\[ \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, we divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment:

\[ \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay each month:

\[ \$255 \]"

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16 square feet.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

1. **4th level (top level):** 16 square feet
2. **3rd level:** \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. **2nd level:** \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. **1st level (bottom level):** \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is:

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first 180 days.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:

\[ 1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bags of dog food this amounts to. Since one bag contains 110 cups, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag:

\[ \frac{180 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} \approx 1.636 \, \text{bags} \]

Since Cecilia can't buy a fraction of a bag, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 2 \, \text{bags} \]"

"Let's denote the number of games the team lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won can be expressed as \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and the games lost. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( L \). We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:
\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of games the team won is \(\boxed{15}\)."

   - The number of dogs is given as 60.
   - The number of cats is two times the number of dogs. So, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits. So, the total number of pets is \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\)."
"First, let's find out how many boys there are. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

This means the number of girls is:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we calculate:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. 

Final answer:
\[ 3 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Volume Loss**: When Freda cooks the canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking.

2. **Volume of Tomatoes Before Cooking**: Since the sauce made is 32 ounces and it is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Volume of Tomatoes per Can**: Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. Since the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is 64 ounces, the number of cans used is:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Number of Tomatoes per Can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

So, Freda used **12 tomatoes**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 30 minutes, 20 more cars drive through, and 5 cars take an exit. This means the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit, plus the 20 that drove through in the last 15 minutes.

First, calculate the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam:
\[ 30 - 5 + 20 = 45 \]

This total (45) includes the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 45 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 45 - 20 \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, we multiply 2 by 40:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, we multiply 1 by 40:

\[ 1 \times 40 = 40 \]

Now, we subtract the number of potted plants she will give away from the total number of potted plants she currently has:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Finally, we add the 18 new potted plants she received yesterday to the remaining potted plants:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ 58 \]"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, let's break down the information given:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we add up all the doorbell rings:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Total doorbell rings = \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\)

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. So, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages on average each day.

**Final Answer:**
6 pages per day"
"Let's break it down:

- John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day.
- He also drinks a glass of water before bed every weekday.
- On weekends, he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekday:
- He drinks water 4 times a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed).
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.

So, the total number of glasses of water on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- He drinks water 3 times a day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed).
- There are 2 weekend days in a week.

So, the total number of glasses of water on weekends is:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we add the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends to get the total for the week:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 6 \text{ glasses} = 26 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week."
"To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can set up a simple proportion based on the information given.

We know that:
- It takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles.
- The city is 42 miles across.

First, we find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, we multiply the number of segments by the time it takes to cover each segment:
\[ 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

140 minutes"
"First, let's find out how many pieces Poppy places on the board. She places a quarter of the 1000 pieces:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

So, 250 pieces are placed on the board by Poppy. This leaves:

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Next, her mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

So, her mom places 250 more pieces. This leaves:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many cookies Cody eats. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Cody eats as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies Cody eats} = 3 \times \text{Cookies Amir eats} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, we add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats to find the total number of cookies they eat together:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Cookies Amir eats} + \text{Cookies Cody eats} = 5 + 15 = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's calculate the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension to find the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

So, the inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length × width × height.

The inner volume of one box is:
\[3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}\]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{72}

"Let's break down the TV watching time for each day:

- **Monday**: 1 hour
- **Tuesday**: 1 hour
- **Thursday**: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- **Friday**: 2 hours
- **Total known time**: 1 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday can be calculated by subtracting the known time from the total time:

\[ 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes make up 1.5 hours:

\[ 1.5 \div 0.5 = 3 \]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he wanted to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. He then dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).
5. We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 - 5 = 110
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
7. Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
8. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

So, Henry baked \(\boxed{50}\) cookies last year."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback.

The cost per gallon is $3.00, so for 10 gallons:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cashback. The app company offers $.20 cashback per gallon. For 10 gallons:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we subtract the cashback from the total cost:
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, after the cashback rewards, the total cost for 10 gallons of gas is:
\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total and then calculate the average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate.
2. Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate.
3. Add the totals from both to find the combined total.
4. Divide the combined total by 2 to find the average.

Let's start with Beatrice:
- Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- To find the total, we multiply the width by the length:
  \[
  2 \times 24 = 48
  \]
  So, Beatrice ate 48 fruit roll-ups.

Next, Marcell:
- Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- To find the total, we multiply the width by the length:
  \[
  3 \times 14 = 42
  \]
  So, Marcell ate 42 fruit roll-ups.

Now, we add the totals from both:
\[
48 + 42 = 90
\]

Finally, to find the average, we divide the combined total by 2:
\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many feet Julia needs to row to reach the shore. Since it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

\[
\text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much water the boat took on during this journey. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, for 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[
\text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 0.2 \times 80 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

So, the boat had taken on \(\boxed{16}\) liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
2. Each lesson involves cleaning the whiteboard 3 times.
3. There are 4 teachers.

First, calculate the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned by one teacher in a day:
- Each teacher cleans the whiteboard 3 times per lesson.
- Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
So, the number of times one teacher cleans the whiteboard in a day is:
\[ 3 \text{ times/lesson} \times 2 \text{ lessons/day} = 6 \text{ times/day} \]

Next, calculate the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned by all 4 teachers in a day:
- Each of the 4 teachers cleans the whiteboard 6 times per day.
So, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is:
\[ 6 \text{ times/day/teacher} \times 4 \text{ teachers} = 24 \text{ times/day} \]

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"First, we calculate the total number of flowers Ryan plants in 15 days. Since he plants 2 flowers each day, we multiply 2 by 15:

\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

This means Ryan plants a total of 30 flowers. However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. To find out how many flowers actually grew, we subtract the 5 flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted:

\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

So, the final number of flowers that grew in Ryan's garden is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Therefore, the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is:
     \[
     \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     300 = 50x
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought ten of these boards at $10 each.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 * $10 = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought five of these boards at $16 each.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 * $16 = $80.

So, the total cost of all the lumber is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- The price has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15.
- Total selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- The price has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24.
- Total selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 * $24 = $120.

So, the total selling price of all the lumber is:
- Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $90."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and how it applies to the total amount of sugar and water Katy used.

The ratio of sugar to water is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the ratio are \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water combined. This total is made up of the parts in the ratio, which is 20 parts.

To find out how much one part is, we divide the total amount by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{One part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \text{ teaspoons} \]

Since the amount of sugar is 7 parts, we multiply the value of one part by 7:
\[ \text{Amount of sugar} = 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ teaspoons} \]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. 

First, we calculate the total number of pairs of shoes:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair of shoes costs $60, so the total cost is:
\[ 6 \text{ pairs} \times 60 \text{ dollars/pair} = 360 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John paid:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of vehicles that were initially at the port from the 2 containers.

Each container had 5 vehicles, and there were 2 containers:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means the number of vehicles brought in on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's find out Adrien's salary four years ago, which is given as $40,000.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. To find the new salary, we calculate 40% of $40,000 and add it to the original amount.

\[ \text{Increase} = 40,000 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40,000 \times 0.40 = 16,000 \]

So, Adrien's new salary is:

\[ 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000 \]

Now, we need to find Lylah's original salary. Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let's denote Lylah's salary as \( L \).

\[ 40,000 = L + 0.30L \]
\[ 40,000 = 1.30L \]
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \]
\[ L = 30,769.23 \]

Now, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% four years later. So, we calculate 40% of Lylah's original salary and add it to the original amount.

\[ \text{Increase for Lylah} = 30,769.23 \times \frac{40}{100} = 30,769.23 \times 0.40 = 12,307.69 \]

So, Lylah's new salary is:

\[ 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 = 43,076.92 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to find the total salary the two were receiving four years later.

\[ \text{Total Salary} = 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Since there are 30 sheets of paper in each pad, he uses \(2 \times 30 = 60\) sheets of paper a week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
- Morisette's total fruits: \(5 + 8 = 13\)
- Kael's total fruits: \(10 + 4 = 14\)

Finally, we add the total number of fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael:
\[13 + 14 = 27\]

So, the total number of fruits they have is:
27"
"Let's break down Sadie's sleep schedule for the week:

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday and Wednesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours each day.
3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept each day and then sum them up:

- **Monday**: 8 hours
- **Tuesday**: 6 hours
- **Wednesday**: 6 hours
- **Thursday**: 7 hours
- **Friday**: 7 hours
- **Saturday**: 7 hours
- **Sunday**: 7 hours

Adding these together:

\[ 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 \]

First, add the hours for the first three days:

\[ 8 + 6 + 6 = 20 \]

Next, add the hours for the remaining four days:

\[ 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28 \]

Now, add the totals from both parts:

\[ 20 + 28 = 48 \]

So, Sadie slept a total of 48 hours throughout the week.

"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down the problem into parts based on the given speeds and times.

1. **First 3 hours:**
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance covered in the first 3 hours = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

2. **Remaining time:**
   - Total time: 7 hours
   - Time already used: 3 hours
   - Remaining time = Total time - Time already used = 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours
   - Speed for the remaining time: 5 miles per hour
   - Distance covered in the remaining 4 hours = Speed × Time = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

3. **Total distance:**
   - Distance covered in the first 3 hours: 30 miles
   - Distance covered in the remaining 4 hours: 20 miles
   - Total distance = Distance covered in the first 3 hours + Distance covered in the remaining 4 hours = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

So, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours."
"First, we need to determine how many letters Jennie stamped. She put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

This means Jennie stamped 20 letters. These 20 letters are now added to the pile of already-stamped letters. We know that after stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Let's denote the number of letters already in the pile of already-stamped letters as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
x + 20 = 30
\]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[
x = 30 - 20 = 10
\]

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

1. Let's say the package Julia bought had \( x \) spoons.
2. Her husband gave her a package of 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she used 3 spoons from the total she had.
4. After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left.

We can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[ (x + 5) - 3 = 12 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought had 10 spoons.

"First, let's find out how many fish sausages Dylan bought. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, and he bought 38 chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages as follows:

Number of fish sausages = Number of chicken sausages + 6
Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6
Number of fish sausages = 44

Now, to find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages together:

Total sausages = Number of chicken sausages + Number of fish sausages
Total sausages = 38 + 44
Total sausages = 82

So, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages."
"First, we need to find out how many friends Amy made. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can calculate the number of friends Amy made as follows:

\[ \text{Number of friends Amy made} = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of friends that Lily and Amy have together. We do this by adding the number of friends Lily made to the number of friends Amy made:

\[ \text{Total number of friends} = 50 + 70 = 120 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's find out the cost of each item based on the information given:

1. Each pepper costs $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so a watermelon costs \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.
3. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- For 4 watermelons: \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.
- For 20 peppers: \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.
- For 10 oranges: \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:

\[180 + 300 + 400 = 880\]

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is **880 dollars**."
"To find the hospital's profit, we need to calculate the revenue from both the patients and the doctors, and then subtract the doctors' charges from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total time spent by doctors in a day:**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
   - Total time in minutes = \(500 \times 24 = 12000\) minutes.
   - Convert minutes to hours: \(12000 \div 60 = 200\) hours.

2. **Calculate the doctors' charges:**
   - The doctors charge $150 per hour.
   - Total doctors' charges = \(200 \times 150 = 30000\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the patients' charges:**
   - The hospital charges $200 per hour.
   - Total patients' charges = \(200 \times 200 = 40000\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the hospital's profit:**
   - Profit = Total patients' charges - Doctors' charges.
   - Profit = \(40000 - 30000 = 10000\) dollars.

The hospital's profit from these visits is **$10000**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Nissa initially hires 60 elves.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. So, we need to calculate a third of 60:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   This means 20 elves quit. So, the number of elves left is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the 40 elves left:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Therefore, the number of elves left is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Joseph's expenditure in June.
2. Add the expenditures of May and June together.

First, we know that Joseph's expenditure in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May. So, we calculate his June expenditure as follows:
\[ 500 - 60 = 440 \]
So, Joseph's expenditure in June was $440.

Next, we add the expenditures of May and June to find the total expenditure for the two months:
\[ 500 + 440 = 940 \]

Therefore, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June is \(\boxed{940}\)."

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ rides} \]

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ rides} \]

Next, we add the total number of rides for both Pam and Fred:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \text{ rides} \]

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is:
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \text{ tickets} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we calculate:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles on Tuesday} \]

Next, we know the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We already know the miles for Monday and Tuesday, so we can find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday by subtracting the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:

\[ 41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13 \]

So, Walt walked \(\boxed{13}\) miles on Wednesday."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost of car washes.
2. Multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year.

First, we know that Tom gets 4 car washes a month and each car wash costs $15. So, the monthly cost is:
\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times \$15/\text{car wash} = \$60/\text{month} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he pays in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
\[ \$60/\text{month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$720/\text{year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs, bags of chips, and cookies before any additional fees or tips.

1. **Cost of subs:**
   \[
   2 \text{ subs} \times \$7.50 \text{ each} = \$15.00
   \]

2. **Cost of bags of chips:**
   \[
   2 \text{ bags} \times \$1.50 \text{ each} = \$3.00
   \]

3. **Cost of cookies:**
   \[
   2 \text{ cookies} \times \$1.00 \text{ each} = \$2.00
   \]

Next, we add these amounts to find the total cost before the delivery fee and tip.

4. **Total cost before fees and tip:**
   \[
   \$15.00 + \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$20.00
   \]

Now, we calculate the 20% delivery fee.

5. **Delivery fee:**
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } \$20.00 = 0.20 \times \$20.00 = \$4.00
   \]

We add the delivery fee to the total cost before the tip.

6. **Total cost with delivery fee:**
   \[
   \$20.00 + \$4.00 = \$24.00
   \]

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip.

7. **Total cost with tip:**

### First Test:
- **Total questions**: 75
- **Rate**: 5 questions per hour
- **Time allowed**: 8 hours

First, calculate how many questions Mark could complete in 8 hours:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions and Mark completed 40 questions:
\[ \text{Questions left incomplete} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

### Second Test:
- **Total questions**: 100
- **Rate**: 5 questions per hour
- **Time allowed**: 6 hours

Next, calculate how many questions Mark could complete in 6 hours:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions and Mark completed 30 questions:
\[ \text{Questions left incomplete} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

### Total Incomplete Questions:

"To find the number of pink gumballs, we start by defining the number of blue gumballs. According to the problem, there are 12 blue gumballs.

The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of pink gumballs} = 4 \times (\text{Number of blue gumballs}) + 22 \]

Substituting the number of blue gumballs (12) into the equation, we get:

\[ \text{Number of pink gumballs} = 4 \times 12 + 22 \]

Now, we perform the multiplication and addition:

\[ \text{Number of pink gumballs} = 48 + 22 \]
\[ \text{Number of pink gumballs} = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic.

Given:
- Total cars = 20
- Automatic cars = 12
- Manual cars = 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be found by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of queens be \( Q \).
2. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the queens, baby bees, and worker bees. So, we can write the equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

To find \( Q \), we divide both sides by 7:
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens \( Q \) is 100, we can find the number of worker bees, which is \( 4Q \):
\[ 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. The milk and eggs are food items.

The cost of the non-food items is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items before tax:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total cost of food items:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

For Steve:
- Distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Speed: 440 feet per minute

Time for Steve to get home:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{Steve}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{Steve}}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

For Tim:
- Distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet
- Speed: 264 feet per minute

Time for Tim to get home:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{Tim}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{Tim}}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in their times:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} - \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

"First, let's calculate the number of tires Shawnda inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came for bicycles, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came for tricycles, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came for a unicycle, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we add up all the tires inflated:
\[10 + 9 + 1 = 20\] tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost in cents is:
\[20 \times 25 = 500\] cents.

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar):
\[500 \div 100 = 5\] dollars.

So, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:

"Let's work through the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack initially.

1. Let the initial number of french fries be \( x \).

2. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).

3. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

5. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( x - 30 \), which is \( \frac{x - 30}{3} \).

6. Ants carried off the final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the remaining fries are \( \frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

Now, we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} = 6
\]
Multiply both sides by 3:
\[
x - 30 = 18
\]
Add 30 to both sides:
\[
x = 48
\]

So, the initial number of french fries in the pack was \(\boxed{48}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on the days he has three 1-hour classes:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has 3 classes each day, each lasting 1 hour.
- So, for each of these days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in classes.

Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours for these days in a week is:
\[3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on the days he has two 2-hour classes:

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes each day, each lasting 2 hours.
- So, for each of these days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in classes.

Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours for these days in a week is:
\[4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ hours/week}\]

Now, let's find the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes in one week by adding the hours from both types of days:
\[9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes in one semester is:

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Next, we add the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

Now, we convert the total length from inches to feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches:
\[3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is:
\[280 \text{ feet}\]"

   - Total bananas needed per month = Monkeys' bananas + Gorillas' bananas + Baboons' bananas
   - Total bananas per month = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

5. **Total Bananas for 2 Months:**
   - Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we multiply the monthly total by 2.
   - Total bananas for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas

**Final Answer:**
The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long and Blake runs back and forth 15 times, the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 100 \text{ yards} \times 2 \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is a round trip of 80 yards, and she does this 34 times. So, the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 80 \text{ yards} \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Since Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards, the difference in the distance they run is:

\[ 3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."
"To find out how much Raphael spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item he bought and then add them all together.

1. **Cost of Pens:**
   - Raphael bought 4 pens.
   - Each pen costs $1.5.
   - Total cost for pens = 4 pens * $1.5/pen = $6.

2. **Cost of Notebooks:**
   - Raphael bought 2 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs $4.
   - Total cost for notebooks = 2 notebooks * $4/notebook = $8.

3. **Cost of Bond Paper:**
   - Raphael bought 1 rim of bond paper.
   - The bond paper costs $20.
   - Total cost for bond paper = 1 rim * $20/rim = $20.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper
- Total cost = $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

So, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"Finn originally sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, so the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6. So initially, he can see:

\[ 11 + 6 = 17 \]

Next, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2. Therefore, the number of tadpoles he can see now is:

\[ 17 - 2 = 15 \]

So, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Depth on Monday:**
   The tank's depth on Monday is 17 feet.

2. **Depth on Tuesday:**
   On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. So, we add 7 feet to the Monday depth:
   \[
   17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Depth on Wednesday:**
   On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is **16 feet**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish each person caught.

**Anakin's Catch:**
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total for Anakin:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

**Locsin's Catch:**
- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin, so \( 10 - 5 = 5 \)
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin, so \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin, so \( 3 + 2 = 5 \)

Total for Locsin:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

**Total Fish Caught by Both:**
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

So, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step. The price increases by 20% every two months.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/ increase}} = 18 \text{ increases} \]

The price increases by 20% each time, which means it is multiplied by 1.20 each time. So, after 18 increases, the price will be:
\[ 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, let's calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the new price after 36 months is:
\[ 20 \times 39.366 = 787.32 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ \boxed{787.32} \]"
"To find the total worth of all the toys, let's break down the information given:

1. One red car costs $4.
2. An action figure costs $5.
3. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, calculate the cost of the doll:
- Since one action figure costs $5, 3 action figures cost \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- There are 5 red cars, each costing $4, so the total cost for the red cars is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.
- There are 3 action figures, each costing $5, so the total cost for the action figures is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- The doll costs $15.

Adding these amounts together:
- Total cost = cost of red cars + cost of action figures + cost of the doll
- Total cost = \(20 + 15 + 15 = 50\) dollars.

So, the total worth of all the toys is **50 dollars**."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the income she would lose by doing her taxes herself.

1. **Calculate the income lost by doing taxes herself:**
   - Jackie loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She loses 3 hours of work.
   - Total income lost = $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

2. **Compare the cost of hiring the accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.

3. **Determine the net difference:**
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she spends $90.
   - If she does her taxes herself, she loses $105 in potential income.
   - The net difference in money is: $105 (lost income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15.

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more. 

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she is purchasing and then subtract that from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of all the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's sum these amounts:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 157 + 74 + 102 \]

We can add these step by step:
\[ 1090 + 157 = 1247 \]
\[ 1247 + 74 = 1321 \]
\[ 1321 + 157 = 1478 \]
\[ 1478 + 74 = 1552 \]
\[ 1552 + 102 = 1654 \]

The total cost of the items is €1654. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by:
\[ 1654 - 1500 = 154 \]

So, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she requires to make 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, Sandra will need:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

So, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's define the current age of Brooke as \( B \) and the current age of Seth as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is \(\boxed{16}\) years old."
"First, let's figure out how much money Jimmy has based on the information given.

Ethel has $8. According to the problem, Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. So, we need to calculate twice the amount Ethel has and then add $2 to it.

Twice the amount Ethel has is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Now, add $2 to this amount to find out how much Jimmy has:
\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to break it down by days.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - Pancho walks 20 miles each day.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Total miles on weekdays = \(20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Pancho walks 10 miles each day.
   - There are 2 days in the weekend.
   - Total miles on weekends = \(10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Total miles in a week:**
   - Total miles = miles on weekdays + miles on weekends.
   - Total miles = \(100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles}\).

So, Pancho walks **120 miles** in a week."
"First, let's find the cost of each item:

1. **Hat**: The cost of the hat is given as $25.

2. **Jacket**: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. So, the cost of the jacket is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Pants**: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. The average is calculated by adding the cost of the hat and the cost of the jacket and then dividing by 2:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:

"First, let's calculate how much Jessica will pay each month if she pays 50% more than the minimum for each debt.

1. **Student Loans:**
   - Minimum payment: $300
   - 50% more: \( 300 \times 1.5 = 450 \)

2. **Credit Card:**
   - Minimum payment: $200
   - 50% more: \( 200 \times 1.5 = 300 \)

3. **Mortgage:**
   - Minimum payment: $500
   - 50% more: \( 500 \times 1.5 = 750 \)

Next, we add up the monthly payments for all debts:
\[ 450 + 300 + 750 = 1500 \]

Now, to find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

"First, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to peel one potato. It takes him about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to peel all the potatoes is:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to cut one potato. It takes him about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to cut all the potatoes is:
\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert 300 seconds into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the potatoes and the time it takes to cut the potatoes:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:

"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after these expenses.

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.

4. **Donation to charity**:
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's find out how many crabs Monic has. Since Bo has 40 crabs and Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we can calculate the number of crabs Monic has as follows:

Bo's crabs: 40
Monic's crabs: 40 - 4 = 36

Next, we need to find out how many crabs Rani has. Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Since Monic has 36 crabs, we can calculate the number of crabs Rani has as follows:

Rani's crabs: 36 + 10 = 46

Now, to find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has:

Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46
Total crabs = 122

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

First, let's calculate his earnings for the first week:
- Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
- He tutored for 5 hours in the first week.
- So, his earnings for the first week are \( 10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate his earnings for the second week:
- Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
- He tutored for 8 hours in the second week.
- So, his earnings for the second week are \( 10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = Earnings from the first week + Earnings from the second week
- Total earnings = \( 50 \text{ dollars} + 80 \text{ dollars} = 130 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

So, the number of votes the loser got is \(20\)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( W \).

According to the problem, the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. So, we can write:
\[ 200 = 5W \]

To find \( W \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Next, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses \( R \) is:
\[ R = 4W = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Thus, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"First, let's figure out Mark's age two years ago. We know that Jan is currently 30 years old.

Two years ago, Jan was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years old.

According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:

\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14
\]

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than 14, so:

\[
14 + 5 = 19
\]

This means that two years ago, Mark was 19 years old. Therefore, Mark's current age is:

\[
19 + 2 = 21
\]

Now, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean's current age is:

\[
21 + 2 = 23
\]

**Final Answer: Jean is 23 years old.**"
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

### Team 1 (Faster Team)
Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four runners:
\[
\text{Total time for Team 1} = 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Team 2 (Slower Team)
The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Let's calculate the time for each runner:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds
- Third runner: \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds
- Fourth runner: \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds

Now, sum the times for all four runners:
\[
\text{Total time for Team 2} = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Difference in Time
To find out how many seconds the faster team wins by, subtract the total time of Team 1 from the total time of Team 2:
\[
\text{Difference} = 222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the faster team will win by \boxed{2} seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the Probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probability is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

**Final Answer:**
25%"
"Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. Since her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked:

\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ apples} \]

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

So, they both picked 30 apples."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \(10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces}\).

2. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the hamsters and rabbits:**
   - Total straw for hamsters and rabbits = \(50 \text{ pieces} + 20 \text{ pieces} = 70 \text{ pieces}\).

4. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw used for the rats:**
   - Total straw distributed = 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = \(160 \text{ pieces} - 70 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces}\).

5. **Calculate the number of rats and the straw each rat gets:**
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months, including the monthly interest.

1. **Initial Amount**: $100

2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2%

3. **Number of Months**: 3

Let's calculate the amount step by step for each month.

**Month 1:**
- Interest for the first month: \(100 \times \frac{2}{100} = 2\)
- Total amount after the first month: \(100 + 2 = 102\)

**Month 2:**
- Interest for the second month: \(102 \times \frac{2}{100} = 2.04\)
- Total amount after the second month: \(102 + 2.04 = 104.04\)

**Month 3:**
- Interest for the third month: \(104.04 \times \frac{2}{100} = 2.0808\)
- Total amount after the third month: \(104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208\)

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is **$106.12**."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the cost per bag:**
   - The cost of buying each bag of wheat is $20.
   - The cost of transporting each bag is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per bag is \(20 + 2 = 22\) dollars.

2. **Identify the selling price per bag:**
   - The selling price of each bag is $30.

3. **Determine the profit per bag:**
   - The profit per bag is the selling price minus the total cost per bag, which is \(30 - 22 = 8\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total number of bags sold:**
   - The trader made a total profit of $400.
   - Since the profit per bag is $8, the total number of bags sold can be calculated by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag.
   - Therefore, the number of bags sold is \( \frac{400}{8} = 50 \).

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides:
\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Amount each paid} = \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends collecting peaches.
2. Determine how many peaches he collects per minute.
3. Multiply the total minutes by the number of peaches collected per minute.

First, we know John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. So, to find the total number of peaches collected, we multiply the total minutes by the number of peaches collected per minute:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for the flock of ten ducks.
2. Then, divide that amount by 7 to find out how much they need per day.

Step 1: Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For ten ducks, the total is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Step 2: Calculate the daily need.
There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the weekly total by 7:
\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out.
   - Now, Sue's front yard has 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Finding the Difference:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

So, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

1. **Initial Number of Cards:**
   Elaine starts with 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **First Month:**
   She collects three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the first month, she has:
   \[
   20 + 60 = 80 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Second Month:**
   She collects 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}

"To find out how much money John made that year after winning the award, we need to consider his regular salary, the one-time monetary reward, and the increased salary due to the 5% raise.

1. **Calculate John's annual salary before the raise:**
   - John makes $2000 per week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - So, his annual salary is \( 2000 \times 52 = 104000 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the new salary after the 5% raise:**
   - The raise is 5% of his original salary.
   - 5% of $104000 is \( 0.05 \times 104000 = 5200 \) dollars.

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cheese used for sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for sandwiches is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

2. **Cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, so he used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese per omelet.
   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for omelets is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) slices.

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the requirement**: Brinley can remove the lowest score from the five tests she has already taken and then average the remaining four scores with the sixth test score to get an average of 93.

2. **Identify the lowest score**: The scores Brinley has are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

3. **Calculate the sum of the remaining scores plus the sixth test score**: If we remove the lowest score (71), the sum of the remaining scores (89, 92, 100, 86) plus the sixth test score (let's call it \( x \)) should be such that the average of these four scores and \( x \) is 93.

4. **Set up the equation**: The average of the four highest scores and the sixth test score should be 93. So, we can write the equation as:
   \[
   \frac{89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x}{5} = 93
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
   \]
   To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 5:
   \[
   367 + x = 465
   \]
   Then, we solve for \( x \) by subtracting 367 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 465 - 367
   \]
   \[
   x = 98
   \]

So, Brinley needs to score \(\boxed{98}\) on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To find out how many kilometers Micheal rode in total, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

First, calculate the total kilometers for one week:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 125 \text{ kilometers/week} \]

Now, calculate the total kilometers for four weeks:
\[ 125 \text{ kilometers/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ kilometers} \]

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

"First, let's determine the weight of each candied apple. We know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g and that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40g}{2} = 20g \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40g = 1000g \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. Since there are 80 candied apples and each weighs 20g, the total weight of the candied apples is:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20g = 1600g \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.
   - So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

3. **Find the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Since the cost of twenty dozen cups is $4800, the cost of one dozen cups is $4800 ÷ 20 = $240.

4. **Calculate the cost of one cup:**
   - Since one dozen cups (12 cups) cost $240, the cost of one cup is $240 ÷ 12 = $20.

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $20."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn.
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she earns \(4x\) dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she has before mowing the lawn is \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars.

To find out how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to find \(x\) such that:
\[ 4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"Let's define the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has \(\boxed{4}\) red chickens."
"First, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(s\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{s} \]

Here, the distance \(d\) is 15 miles and the speed \(s\) is 3 miles per hour. Substituting these values in, we get:

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, at that time, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that currently the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

Final answer:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Janeth will pay in total over 12 months. She is paying $165 each month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total payment from the total amount to be returned to find the remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, let's find out how many dahlias there are. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias together:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

So, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"First, let's find the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information given.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Next, we need to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age in three years will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age in three years will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

So, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years will be \(\boxed{45}\)."
"First, let's find out how many points each student scored based on the information given.

1. **Naomi's Points:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Points:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, we calculate half of Naomi's points first:
   \[
   \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   Then add 10 to this:
   \[
   34 + 10 = 44
   \]
   So, Yuri scored 44 points.

3. **Brianna's Points:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, we add 17 to Naomi's points:
   \[
   68 + 17 = 85
   \]
   So, Brianna scored 85 points.

4. **Total Points:**
   The total points scored by all four students is 251.

Now, let's calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total:
\[
251 - 197 = 54
\]

So, Jojo scored **54 points**."
"To find out how much time Carmen spent solving puzzles, we need to calculate the time she spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, let's calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent = time on crossword puzzles + time on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing these games."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial amount of water in the tank:**
   - The tank is initially filled with 120 liters of water.

2. **Water used by Celine:**
   - Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank.
   - Water left in the tank after Celine used some: \( 120 - 90 = 30 \) liters.

3. **Rainwater collected:**
   - Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank.
   - Rainwater collected: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) liters.

4. **Total water in the tank now:**
   - Water left in the tank after Celine used some: 30 liters.
   - Rainwater added: 60 liters.
   - Total water in the tank now: \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) liters.

So, the final amount of water in the tank is **90 liters**."
"First, let's find out how many petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, to find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"First, we need to find out how much the company spends on advertising in the second year. It spends a third of the $15000 spent in the first year.

To find a third of $15000, we divide $15000 by 3:
\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising in the second year.

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year to find the total amount spent over the two years:
\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals altogether, we need to calculate the cost for each of them separately and then add those costs together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- So, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- So, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

So, the final numerical answer is:
180"
"First, let's determine how many days it takes to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. According to the problem, it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus. Since it takes 6 days to travel by bus, it will take:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total travel time for the round trip. Andrew will travel to Rochester by bus and return by car. Therefore, the total travel time is the sum of the days it takes to travel by bus to Rochester and the days it takes to travel by car back from Rochester:

\[ 6 \text{ days (by bus)} + 3 \text{ days (by car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine the new number of each type of Pokemon card James has after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (no change)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has now:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. This is calculated by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:
\[ 33 \]

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:

2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Now, let's add these costs together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad still owes $9.00."
"First, let's determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute together.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom places half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom places \(4 \div 2 = 2\) pieces per minute.

Together, they place \(4 + 2 = 6\) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[
\frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time it takes them to complete the puzzle is:

\[
\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm. 

1. Calculate 30% of 120 watermelons:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{30}{100} \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.

2. Subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the total to find the remaining watermelons:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

3. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

4. Subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons to find how many were not ready:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax. The tax rate is 10%, so we find 10% of $240,000.

\[ 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration.

\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Next, we calculate the registration cost. Each car has a $1000 registration fee, and there are 12 cars.

\[ 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the registration cost to the total cost before registration to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final amount Mark pays for everything is:

\[ \boxed{276000} \]"
"First, let's find out how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. Since Robert collected 20 shells and Kylie collected 5 more than Robert, we can calculate the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday as follows:

\[ \text{Shells collected by Kylie on Monday} = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to determine how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. According to the problem, Kylie collected 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday. Therefore, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2:

\[ \text{Shells collected by Kylie on Tuesday} = 25 \times 2 = 50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of bugs.
2. Add the number of bugs to the number of ants to get the total number of insects.

First, we know that Dax found half as many bugs as ants. Since there were 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:
\[
\text{Number of bugs} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Next, we add the number of bugs to the number of ants to find the total number of insects:
\[
\text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75
\]

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is:
\[
\boxed{75}

"First, we need to find out how many penguins jump in the ocean. One-third of 36 penguins is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]

So, 12 penguins jump in the ocean.

Next, we need to find out how many penguins go inside the cave. Again, one-third of 36 penguins is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]

So, 12 penguins go inside the cave.

Now, we need to determine how many penguins are still left sunbathing. We start with 36 penguins and subtract the 12 that went to the ocean and the 12 that went to the cave:

\[
36 - 12 - 12 = 12
\]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's figure out how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \text{Tomatoes eaten by girlfriend per day} = \frac{\text{Tomatoes eaten by Steve per day}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tomatoes eaten by both Steve and his girlfriend per day:

\[ \text{Total tomatoes per day} = \text{Tomatoes eaten by Steve per day} + \text{Tomatoes eaten by girlfriend per day} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week:

\[ \text{Total tomatoes per week} = \text{Total tomatoes per day} \times 7 = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can determine the number of vines needed by dividing the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes each vine produces:

\[ \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{\text{Total tomatoes per week}}{\text{Tomatoes per vine per week}} = \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

So, Steve needs \(\boxed{21}\) vines."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   Ram buys 25 pens.

2. **Using Pens to Make New Pens:**
   Ram can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, for every 5 pens he uses, he gets 1 new pen.

3. **First Cycle:**
   - He starts with 25 pens.
   - He uses 20 pens to make 4 new pens (since 20 pens / 5 pens per new pen = 4 new pens).
   - After making 4 new pens, he has 5 pens left (25 - 20 + 4 = 9 pens).

4. **Second Cycle:**
   - Now he has 9 pens.
   - He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen.
   - After making 1 new pen, he has 5 pens left (9 - 5 + 1 = 5 pens).

5. **Third Cycle:**
   - Now he has 5 pens.
   - He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen.
   - After making 1 new pen, he has 1 pen left (5 - 5 + 1 = 1 pen).

6. **Total Pens:**
   - Pens from the initial purchase: 25
   - Pens made from the first cycle: 4
   - Pens made from the second cycle: 1
   - Pens made from the third cycle: 1

   \]
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan. So, Mary's age is:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:
\[
20 + 25 + 23 = 68

"First, let's find out how many students went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = \frac{30}{100} \times 1000 = 300 \]

So, 300 students went out through exit A. This means the number of students remaining in the hall is:

\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining students went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

So, 420 students went out through exit B. This means the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"First, let's find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]

So,

\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, we know Robert has 27 candies. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

Final numerical answer:

1. Dolly has 2 books.
2. Pandora has 1 book.

When Dolly reads Pandora's book, she adds 1 more book to her count.
When Pandora reads Dolly's books, she adds 2 more books to her count.

So, Dolly's total books read will be:
- Her original 2 books + 1 book from Pandora = 3 books

And Pandora's total books read will be:
- Her original 1 book + 2 books from Dolly = 3 books

Now, we add the total books read by both Dolly and Pandora:
- Dolly's total: 3 books
- Pandora's total: 3 books

3 + 3 = 6

By the end, they will collectively read **6 books**."
"First, let's figure out how many pen pals Mike is still writing to. He originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now writing to:

\[5 - 2 = 3\]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike needs to write in response to these letters is:

\[3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages}\]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing a week is:

\[30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 180 \text{ minutes}\]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total minutes into hours:

\[180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\]

So, the final answer is:

\[3 \text{ hours}\]"
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, we multiply 15 minutes by 30 days:

   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 19 - 10 = 9
   \]

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken.
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by Colby} = 5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 9 + x - 2
   \]

6. **Final number of fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin ended up with 27 fries.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
2. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \(32 - 4 = 28\).
3. This difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums combined. So, if we let \(F\) be the number of fish in each aquarium, then the total number of fish in both aquariums is \(2F\).
4. According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   28 = 2 \times 2F
   \]
5. Simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[
   28 = 4F
   \]
6. Solve for \(F\) by dividing both sides by 4:
   \[
   F = \frac{28}{4} = 7
   \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works each week:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours for the 5 weeks:

\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost before the discount:

\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$30,000 \]

Since the makeup artist gives a 10% discount after the movie is done, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost:

\[ 10\% \times \$30,000 = 0.10 \times \$30,000 = \$3,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid:

\[ \$30,000 - \$3,000 = \$27,000 \]

So, Jean paid:

\[ \$27,000 \]"
"First, let's add up all the expenses Isabelle had for the party supplies:

- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

So, the total cost of the party supplies is $96.

Isabelle split this cost evenly with her two parents, which means the cost was divided into 3 equal parts.

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ 96 \div 3 = 32 \]

Each person paid $32."

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost.
The cost of one pound of onions is $1.50.
So, the total cost is:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

**Monday:**
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

**Tuesday:**
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

**Total cookies eaten by Sue:**
- Monday: 20 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies
- Total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies

**Total cookies eaten by her sister:**
- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 13 cookies
- Total: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:

**Calories consumed by Sue:**
\[ 46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

**Calories consumed by her sister:**
\[ 18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister:

\[ 9200 \text{ calories} - 3600 \text{ calories} = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."

"First, let's determine the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood tree:

\[
\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any part of it is:

\[
20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Termites ate 30% of the redwood. To find out how much weight was eaten, we calculate 30% of 8000 pounds:

\[
0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the original weight to find the remaining weight of the redwood:

\[
8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, Carla will need \(\boxed{11}\) cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"First, we need to find out how many pennies are in two thirds of the cup.

To do this, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in two thirds of the cup.

Since 100 pennies make up $1.00, we can find the dollar amount by dividing the number of pennies by 100:

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, twice that number is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Adding 5 to this number gives us the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand. We do this by subtracting the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

1. **Brokerage Fee:**
   - The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Selling price = $350,000
   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = \( 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \)

2. **Transfer Fee:**
   - The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   - Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = \( 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \)

3. **Total Additional Fees:**
   - Total additional fees = Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   - Total additional fees = $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

4. **Total Price of the House:**
   - Total price = Selling price + Total additional fees
   - Total price = $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

5. **Difference from Budget:**

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the transfer fees.
2. Calculate the brokerage fee.
3. Add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to the loan amount he paid.
4. Subtract the total of these amounts from the selling price to find the net proceeds.

Let's start with the transfer fees:
\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 3\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = \$12,000 \]

Next, the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = \$20,000 \]

Now, add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to the loan amount he paid:
\[ \text{Total additional costs} = \$12,000 + \$20,000 + \$250,000 = \$282,000 \]

Finally, subtract the total additional costs from the selling price to find the net proceeds:
\[ \text{Net proceeds} = \$400,000 - \$282,000 = \$118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bedroom Windows:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows per house due to bedrooms is \(3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}\).
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 6 \text{ windows/house} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows/house} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total Windows:**

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body takes. So, the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. So, the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. So, the number of stitches used for the two sleeves is:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches per sleeve is:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

So, each sleeve takes \(\boxed{315}\) stitches."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Lyrics to the Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them.

Next, we find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

This means 24 cards had the letter B on them.

After removing the cards with the letter B, we have:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

This means 15 cards had the letter C on them.

Finally, to find out how many cards had the letter D on them, we subtract the number of cards with letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards:

\[ 80 - (32 + 24 + 15) = 80 - 71 = 9 \]

"First, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the small holes:

- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30

Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole × 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the large holes:

- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15

Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole × 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, let's add the total time for both small and large holes:

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total time in hours = 240 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

"Let's define the current ages of Ruby and Sam with variables. Let \( S \) be Sam's current age and \( R \) be Ruby's current age.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

Now, substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each.

\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \]

So, the total cost for the popsicles is $5.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.

\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \]

So, the total cost for the ice cream bars is $2.

Now, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid.

\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is $7."
"First, let's find out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2.

Number of spots on a mamba = \( \frac{70}{2} = 35 \)

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park.

Total spots for cobras = Number of cobras × Number of spots on a cobra
Total spots for cobras = \( 40 \times 70 = 2800 \)

Total spots for mambas = Number of mambas × Number of spots on a mamba
Total spots for mambas = \( 60 \times 35 = 2100 \)

Now, we add the total spots for cobras and mambas to get the combined total.

Combined total spots = Total spots for cobras + Total spots for mambas
Combined total spots = \( 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \)

Finally, we find half the number of spots they all have combined.

Half the combined total spots = \( \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \)

**Final numerical answer:**
2450"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game.

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) guests.
- There are also 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ (team members)} + 24 \text{ (guests)} + 3 \text{ (coaches)} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by 3:
\[ \frac{39}{3} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Since each pizza costs $15, the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend:
\[ \boxed{195} \] dollars."
"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - Each necklace is 25 inches long.
   - Length occupied by topaz gemstones = 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) inches.

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads needed:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long.
   - Number of sterling silver beads = \( \frac{17}{\frac{1}{4}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \).

Therefore, Katerina uses \(\boxed{68}\) sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week.
2. Add the number of stories written in the first week to the number of stories written in the second week for each person.
3. Sum the total number of stories written by all three.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week. Since they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:

- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Next, we add the number of stories written in the first week to the number of stories written in the second week for each person:

- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we sum the total number of stories written by all three:

\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"First, let's find out how old Ann's brother is now. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Ann's brother is currently 18 years old.

Next, we need to find out how old he will be in 3 years. We add 3 years to his current age:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]

Therefore, in 3 years, Ann's brother will be 21 years old."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents:
\[ 5 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents:
\[ 2 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and the dimes to find the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has:
\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, Kelly will have \(\boxed{90}\) cents left."
"To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are on the flag, let's first calculate the total number of stars used in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

There are two rows of 6 stars:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Subtracting the 36 stars used in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Since each row of 5-star rows contains 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 8 \text{ rows} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry 2000 pounds.

To find the number of trucks needed, we divide the total weight by the weight each truck can carry:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"First, let's find the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals}\]

Next, we need to find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals}\]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. So, we calculate:

\[39 \times 10 = 390\]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[390\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so:
\[ 5 \text{ bars/packet} \times 8 \text{ packets} = 40 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we calculate how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total:

Each of the 4 adults gets 6 chocolate bars, so:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars/adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

There are 8 children, and the 16 remaining chocolate bars need to be shared equally among them. So, we divide the remaining bars by the number of children:
\[ 16 \text{ bars} \div 8 \text{ children} = 2 \text{ bars/child} \]

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"First, let's calculate the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. but takes a half-hour break. So, the total time she works is:

11 a.m. - 8 a.m. = 3 hours
3 hours - 0.5 hours (break) = 2.5 hours

Now, convert 2.5 hours into minutes because her earnings are calculated in minutes:
2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Next, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:
150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we can calculate her total earnings:
15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

1. **Mike's points**: Mike has 21 points.
2. **Jim's points**: Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
3. **Tony's points**: Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to check if each player gets an extra point in the fourth round. A player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- **Mike**: Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- **Jim**: Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim's total remains 18 points.
- **Tony**: Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players after the fourth round:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

Total points = \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\)

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is \(8 \div 2 = 4\) years old.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges each son washes. The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges. The youngest son is 4 years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

Now, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons: \(8 + 4 = 12\).

Will originally bought 15 oranges. If 12 oranges are washed, the number of oranges left unwashed is \(15 - 12 = 3\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate the number of activities Darren does on the second day.

- **Pushups on the second day**: He does 20 more than on the first day, so \(100 + 20 = 120\) pushups.
- **Squats on the second day**: He does 10 fewer than on the first day, so \(50 - 10 = 40\) squats.
- **Dumbbell presses on the second day**: He does double the number of the first day, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dumbbell presses.

Now, let's add up the activities for each type over the two days.

- **Total pushups**: \(100 + 120 = 220\)
- **Total squats**: \(50 + 40 = 90\)
- **Total dumbbell presses**: \(20 + 40 = 60\)

Finally, we sum up all the activities:

\[220 + 90 + 60 = 370\]

So, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is **370**."
"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for the household, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total rice consumption per meal:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 members in the household.
   - Therefore, the total rice consumption per meal is \( 0.2 \, \text{kg/person} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \).

2. **Calculate the total rice consumption per day:**
   - Each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner.
   - Therefore, the total rice consumption per day is \( 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \).

3. **Calculate the total rice consumption per week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total rice consumption per week is \( 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \).

4. **Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - The total amount of rice is 42 kg.
   - The weekly consumption is 14 kg.
   - Therefore, the number of weeks the rice will last is \( \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of crates Sam sold from Tuesday to Friday.

- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
- Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

So, Sam sold a total of 65 crates from Tuesday to Friday.

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates in a week. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with an opening bid of $200.
2. **Bids by Others**: There are 3 other people who each bid once. Since the bids rise by $50 each time, the bids by the other people are:
   - First other person: $200 + $50 = $250
   - Second other person: $250 + $50 = $300
   - Third other person: $300 + $50 = $350
3. **Carmen's Bids**: Carmen bids after each of the other three people, so her bids are:
   - After the first other person: $300
   - After the second other person: $350
   - After the third other person: $400

4. **Total Cost**: The total cost is the sum of all the bids Carmen makes, including the initial bid and the three subsequent bids:
   - Initial bid: $200
   - First bid after others: $300
   - Second bid after others: $350
   - Third bid after others: $400

Adding these together:
\[ 200 + 300 + 350 + 400 = 1250 \]

So, the desk costs Carmen \(\boxed{1250}\) dollars."
"To find out how much John pays annually for the driving service, we need to calculate the cost based on the miles driven and the bonus given.

1. **Calculate the total miles driven in a year:**
   - John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so he drives 60 miles each day.
   - He works 5 days a week and the service operates for 50 weeks a year.
   - Therefore, the total miles driven in a year is \(60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year}\).

2. **Calculate the cost based on the miles driven:**
   - He is charged $2 per mile.
   - So, the cost for the miles driven is \(15000 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Calculate the total bonus given in a year:**
   - He gives a $150 bonus per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, the total bonus for the year is \(150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars}\).

4. **Calculate the total annual cost:**
   - The total annual cost is the sum of the cost for the miles driven and the total bonus.
   - Therefore, the total annual cost is \(30000 \text{ dollars} + 1800 \text{ dollars} = 31800 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{31800}

"First, let's find out how long Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the combined time by 2:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To create a 32-page tabloid, you would need 16 pieces of paper. 

Here's why: Each piece of paper, when folded in half, can print 4 pages (2 on the front and 2 on the back). So, for 32 pages, you would need 32 divided by 4, which equals 8 pieces of paper. However, since each piece of paper is folded in half to make two pages on the front and two on the back, you actually only need half the number of pieces of paper as the total number of pages divided by 4. Therefore, 32 pages divided by 4 equals 8, and since each piece of paper makes 2 pages, you need 16 pieces of paper in total. 

Final numerical answer:
16"
"Annika spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

She also spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the total amount spent is:

So, the amount left is $15."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise started with 250 books.
2. Currently, there are 50 unsold books.
3. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total books sold so far is \(90 + 45 + \text{second year sales} = 200\).

Let's find out how many books she sold in the second year:
\[90 + 45 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[135 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 200 - 135 = 65\]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

**Final Answer:**
The total amount of money she earned in the second year is $1300."
"First, let's calculate how much Watson earns from his hourly wage each week.

Watson works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour. So, his daily earnings are:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Since he works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
\[ \$100/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well, Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total weekly earnings are:
\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

April typically has 4 weeks. Therefore, Watson's total earnings for April are:
\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$3200 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$3200 \]"
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them.

First, we calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's find out how many loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. This means that the number of loaves left after the morning sales is:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Next, half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon (and also in the evening) is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's find out how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. 

So, if Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week.

\[ \text{Answer: } 4 \text{ weeks} \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:

- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Now, let's calculate the savings on the milk:

- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5

Next, we calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:

- Total savings on ice cream: 2 tubs * $2 savings per tub = $4
- Total savings on milk: 4 packets * $0.5 discount per packet = $2

Finally, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk:

- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

So, you will save $6 if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk."
"To determine how many new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs that will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Calculate the number of extra arms:**
   - Arms grow every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times an extra arm will grow is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Calculate the number of extra legs:**
   - Legs grow every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times an extra leg will grow is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of new limbs:**

   - Total new limbs = 5 + 3 = 8

So, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each:
\[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 suitcases. Each suitcase costs $50:
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100:
\[ 5 \times 100 = 500 \]
Adding $700 to this amount gives:
\[ 500 + 700 = 1200 \]

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, the total amount he can spend on other items is:
\[ 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ 600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950 \]

To find out how much Theo has left to spend on gifts, we subtract the total spent on these items from the amount he can spend:
\[ 4000 - 1950 = 2050 \]

So, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{2050}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the family consumes \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs each day.

Now, to find out how many eggs they consume in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\(13 \times 7 = 91\)

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To find out how old Trent is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. So, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. So, we can calculate Trent's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Therefore, Trent is \(\boxed{32}\) years old."
"First, let's find out Noah's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, Noah's age six years ago was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old.

This means Noah is currently \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

If the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, then the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

So, the population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. This gives us the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot 3D + 2 \cdot \frac{D}{2} = 2 \cdot 105 \]
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited to find out how many people showed up:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. He added these 20 marbles to a store that already had 50 marbles.
3. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8\) marbles.
4. Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Solomon has. This is the sum of the marbles he originally had, the marbles he bought, and the marbles his father gave him:
   \[
   50 + 20 + 8 = 78
   \]
5. Each marble weighs 2 kilograms. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:
   \[
   78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
   \]

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is \(\boxed{156}\) kg."
"To find out how much it costs to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool and then multiply that by the cost per cubic foot.

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   - The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep.
   - Volume \( V \) is calculated as:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
     \]
     Substituting the given dimensions:
     \[
     V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool:**
   - The cost to fill one cubic foot is $0.10.
   - Total cost \( C \) is calculated as:
     \[
     C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot}
     \]
     Substituting the volume and the cost per cubic foot:
     \[
     C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{\$}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[

"First, let's find out how many girls there are in the classroom. Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 3 × Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 × 30
Number of girls = 90

Next, let's determine the number of nongendered children. The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so:

Number of nongendered children = 1/10 × Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 × 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, to find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:

Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires, we can calculate the number of electric poles as follows:

1. According to the ratio, for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.
2. If there are 45 electric wires, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as \( P \).

The ratio can be written as:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"First, let's find the total number of people at the beginning of the party:

- Number of men: 25
- Number of women: 15

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left the party:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

This means the number of people who stayed at the party is:

40 - 10 = 30 people

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find out how many women stayed, we subtract the number of men who stayed from the total number of people who stayed:

Number of women who stayed = 30 (total people who stayed) - 22 (men who stayed) = 8 women

So, the final numerical answer is:

8 women are left at the party."
"First, let's find out how much the magazine costs. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book, and a book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the pen costs. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has in total. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. 

So, Jam's total pencils = 26.

Meg has 46 pencils.

To find out the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together, we add Jam's pencils to Meg's pencils:

26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

Now, we need to determine how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all 72 pencils. Since the problem states that Jam has three boxes and each box presumably holds the same number of pencils, we can assume that each box holds the same amount of pencils as the 26 pencils minus the 2 loose pencils, which means each box holds:

(26 - 2) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box.

To find out how many boxes are needed for 72 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

72 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 9 boxes.

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

**Final Answer:**
9 boxes."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool her coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate how much the coffee is weakened by adding both the ice cubes and the cream.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes needed:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Adding 15 milliliters of cream will also weaken the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Calculate the total weakening:**
   The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
   \[
   60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Trade Ratio**: For every 2 old records, people get 1 new record.

2. **Total New Records Traded For**: The 5 people leave with 7 new records.

3. **Calculating Old Records Traded For New Records**: Since 1 new record is given for every 2 old records, for 7 new records, the number of old records traded would be:
   \[
   7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records}
   \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of **14 old records**."
"First, let's find out how many junior programmers there are. Since the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

This means there are 40 junior programmers. Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, each senior programmer is paid:

\[ 2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month} \]

Thus, the total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal be \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus now is \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the total number of people on the bus now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplify the expression: \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

5. We know that after these changes, there are 20 people on the bus heading to the third stop. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]

6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \)."

"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we need to calculate the time it takes to charge the remaining 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time needed to charge 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"First, let's find out how many lollipops Erin has after her mother gives her more.

Erin originally has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so:

\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \]

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \]

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

So, the number of $20 increments in $80 is:
\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \]

This means they earned $4 off their next purchase.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their $4 reward. However, they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of their reward off the price. Since their reward was $4, the coupon took:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

So, the total discount they received is the sum of the reward and the coupon:
\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \]

Now, we subtract this total discount from the amount they spent:
\[ 43 - 12 = 31 \]

Therefore, the customer paid:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Taxes: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

**Job B:**
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining salary after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

"First, let's find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we calculate:

Thomas's hot dogs = 3 × Luke's hot dogs
Thomas's hot dogs = 3 × 2
Thomas's hot dogs = 6

Next, we find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so:

John's hot dogs = 1/2 × Thomas's hot dogs
John's hot dogs = 1/2 × 6
John's hot dogs = 3

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:

More hot dogs John ate = John's hot dogs - Luke's hot dogs

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Since the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the larger groups, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students in the class is 200, and the class is split into three groups. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of cows and chickens Farmer Brown has.

Let's say the number of cows is \( C \). Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens would be \( 2C \).

The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows. Since he has twice as many chickens, he has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ chickens} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ 20 \text{ cows} \times 4 \text{ legs per cow} + 40 \text{ chickens} \times 2 \text{ legs per chicken} \]
\[ = 80 + 80 \]
\[ = 160 \]

"The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, the blue beetle and the green toad each weigh 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal. The weights of the animals are:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Adding these weights together with the container's weight:

"First, let's find out how many meters Tyson needs to run each day according to his coach's advice.

Tyson originally runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more. So, we calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \) of 5000 meters:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we add this to the original distance:

\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

So, Tyson needs to run 6000 meters each day.

Next, we need to find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days.

Now, we calculate the total distance Tyson runs in June:

\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180,000 \text{ meters} \]

"First, let's calculate how many cookies Jenny's son takes for his lunch each week. Since he takes 4 cookies 5 days a week, we have:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate how many cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. Since he eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, we have:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we add the cookies taken by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are taken out of the bag each week:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies/week} + 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 27 \text{ cookies/week} \]

The total number of cookies in a bag is 36. To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the number of cookies taken by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies in the bag:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, Jenny eats:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.

Each shirt costs $30, so for 2 shirts:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the discount is. The discount is 40%, so we calculate 40% of $60:
\[ 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the original total cost to find out how much Davos paid:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily earnings from tractors were:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos:

- They now sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily earnings from silos are:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage more they are making per day now compared to when they were making tractors.

The increase in daily earnings is:
\[ \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in Earnings}}{\text{Original Earnings}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, they are making 10% more per day now.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

1. **Calculate the monthly cost of food:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - So, the monthly cost of food is \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) dollars.

2. **The monthly cost of treats is $20.**

3. **The monthly cost of medicine is $100.**

4. **Calculate the total monthly cost:**
   - Total monthly cost = Cost of food + Cost of treats + Cost of medicine
   - Total monthly cost = \( 100 + 20 + 100 = 220 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the yearly cost:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, the yearly cost is \( 220 \times 12 = 2640 \) dollars.

Therefore, Madeline spends **$2640** on her dog per year."
"Let's break down each activity and calculate the total time step by step.

1. **Yoga class on Monday**: 1 hour
2. **Cooking class on Tuesday**: 3 times the yoga class, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
3. **Cheese-tasting event on Wednesday**: 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes)
4. **Museum tour on Thursday**: Half the time of the cooking class, so \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) hours
5. **Errands on Friday**: 2 hours

Now, let's add all these times together:

\[
1 \text{ (Monday)} + 3 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)}
\]

Adding these up:

\[
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's figure out how many plant pots April needs for the roses. Since they need twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, and they need 30 pots for the daisies, we calculate the number of pots for the roses as follows:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

So, April needs 60 plant pots for the roses.

Next, we add the number of pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of pots required:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of pots needed from the number of pots she bought:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

**Final Answer:**
10"
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Andrea spent and gave away.
2. Subtract the total amount spent and given away from the initial amount of money she had.

First, let's calculate the total amount Andrea spent and gave away:
- She spent $11 on a sweater.
- She gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount spent and given away is:
\[ 11 + 4 = 15 \]

Next, we subtract this total from the initial amount of money she had:
- Andrea initially had $36.

So, the amount she saved is:
\[ 36 - 15 = 21 \]

Therefore, Andrea saved \(\boxed{21}\)."
"First, let's break down the time John spent on each activity:

1. **Boating**: John spent 6 hours boating.
2. **Swimming**: He spent half the time he spent boating swimming, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.
3. **Watching Shows**: He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours watching shows.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time he spent on vacation as \( T \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings, the money from her first job, and the money from her second job:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, Annabelle still needs to save:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, let's find the height of the second tree. Since it is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, and the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the second tree is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree, so:

\[ 2 \times 17 \text{ feet} = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:

\[ 34 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean started with $28. After spending $17, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we'll subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of mini-golf} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one person} = \$5 + \$20 = \$25
   \]

4. **Cost for Morgan herself:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Morgan} = \$25
   \]

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for Morgan} + \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Money left for friends:**
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for one friend (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for one friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Money left}}{\text{Cost for one friend}} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4
   \]

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day.

The cost of 4 lollipops each day is:
\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to find out how much money Marisa has left each day after buying the lollipops. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the amount she saves each day is:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much she saves over 5 days. If she saves $4 each day, then over 5 days, she saves:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after 5 days is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Total cost of gumballs = \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the amount of money Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy spent $2 on gumballs.
   - Let \( C \) be the amount of money he had before buying gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( C - 2 = \) the amount of money he had after buying gumballs.

3. **Determine the amount of money Billy had after buying candy:**
   - Let \( P \) be the amount of money he spent on candy.
   - The total amount of money he had initially was $10.
   - Therefore, \( 10 - P = C \).

4. **Relate the amount of money after buying candy to the amount after buying gumballs:**
   - He took half of his change and spent it on gumballs.
   - So, \( \frac{1}{2} (10 - P - P) = 2 \).
   - Simplify the equation: \( \frac{1}{2} (10 - 2P) = 2 \).
   - Multiply both sides by 2: \( 10 - 2P = 4 \).
   - Solve for \( P \): \( 10 - 4 = 2P \).
   - \( 6 = 2P \).
   - \( P = 3 \).

5. **Calculate the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   - The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound.
   - Therefore, the number of pounds of candy = \( \frac{P}{1.5} = \frac{3}{1.5} = 2 \).

So, Billy bought \(\boxed{2}\) pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is \(\boxed{25}\) years old."
"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(100 + 75 - 50 = 125\) miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of 175 miles)

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days} \]

So, the train goes between services every 20 days.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's determine how much stuffing is needed for a collie bed. The problem states that a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, a collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For the chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

For the collie beds:
\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, Mark needs \(\boxed{23}\) pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds."
"To find out how long John's trip took, we need to calculate the time for each part of his journey and then add them together.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - Distance: 220 miles (200 miles to the friend's house + 10 miles detour)
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 220 miles / 70 mph = 3.14 hours

2. **Second Leg of the Trip:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add the times together:
- Total time = 3.14 hours + 3 hours = 6.14 hours

So, the total trip took **6.14 hours**."
"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, let's follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys:**
   - We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total.

   - Therefore, the number of boys is \( 96 - 43 = 53 \).

2. **Calculate the number of boys absent on Friday:**
   - On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent.

3. **Calculate the number of boys present on Friday:**
   - The number of boys present is the total number of boys minus the number of boys absent.
   - So, \( 53 - 4 = 49 \).

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is **49**."
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of girls in the park.
2. Calculate the number of boys in the park.
3. Add the number of girls and boys to get the total number of kids.

Step 1: Identify the number of girls.
There are 6 girls in the park.

Step 2: Calculate the number of boys.
The problem states that there are twice the number of boys as girls. So, we multiply the number of girls by 2:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]
Therefore, there are 12 boys in the park.

Step 3: Add the number of girls and boys to get the total number of kids.
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's find out how many people were kicked out for shoplifting. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that number minus 5. So, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

So, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.

Next, we need to find out how many people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. The problem states that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. So, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

So, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of people kicked out. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - (3 + 7 + 21) = 50 - 31 = 18 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[
\boxed{18}

"To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, let's follow these steps:

1. Determine how many points Erin has now.
2. Calculate how many points Erin had before scoring the 14 points.

First, we know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Sara has 8 points. Therefore, Erin's current points are three times Sara's points:

\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we know Erin's current points are 24. Since she scored 14 points to reach this total, we can find out how many points she had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her current points:

\[ \text{Erin's points before} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring the 14 points.

"To find out how much will be spent on the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost for each type of gift and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is:
     \[
     44 \times 20 = 880 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of etching the picture frames:**
   - The etching cost is 20% of the cost of each picture frame.
   - So, the etching cost per frame is:
     \[
     20 \times 0.20 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The total etching cost for all 44 frames is:
     \[
     44 \times 4 = 176 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of pins:**
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - 2 seniors will receive pins, so the total cost for the pins is:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers.
   - The number of officers is:
     \[
     \frac{44}{4} = 11 \text{ officers}

So, if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, the total cost would be $320."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Friday Sales:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes on Friday.
   - Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the number of shoes sold on Friday is:
     \[
     14 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes per pair} = 28 \text{ shoes}
     \]

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   - On Saturday, the store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   - Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Saturday is:
     \[
     2 \times 14 \text{ pairs} = 28 \text{ pairs}
     \]
   - Converting pairs to shoes:
     \[
     28 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes per pair} = 56 \text{ shoes}
     \]

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   - On Sunday, the store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Sunday is:
     \[
     \frac{28 \text{ pairs}}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs}
     \]
   - Converting pairs to shoes:
     \[
     14 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes per pair} = 28 \text{ shoes}
     \]
   - However, six pairs were returned, so the actual number of shoes sold on Sunday is:
     \[
     28 \text{ shoes} - 6 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes per pair} = 28 \text{ shoes} - 12 \text{ shoes} = 16 \text{ shoes}
     \]

4. **Total Sales:**
   - Adding up the shoes sold over the three days:
     \[
     28 \text{ (Friday)} + 56 \text{ (Saturday)} + 16 \text{ (Sunday)} = 100 \text{ shoes}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:

1. On Tuesdays, she practiced for 1 hour.
2. On Thursdays, she practiced for 2 hours.
3. On Saturdays, she practiced for twice as long as on Tuesdays, which is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.

Now, we add these hours together:

\[1 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 2 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Saturday)} = 5 \text{ hours}\]

So, Hallie had dance practice for a total of 5 hours a week.

"First, let's find out the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total equipment was faulty, we calculate 40% of $400,000.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

This means the faulty pieces of equipment are worth $160,000. 

To find the value of the functioning pieces of equipment, we subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total amount spent:

\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then add the results together.

1. First, we determine how many sheep produce 1 kg of milk each day. Since Mary has 30 sheep and half of them produce 1 kg of milk, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ sheep}
   \]
   So, 15 sheep produce 1 kg of milk each day.

2. Next, we determine how many sheep produce 2 kg of milk each day. Since the other half of the sheep produce 2 kg of milk, we again calculate:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ sheep}
   \]
   So, 15 sheep produce 2 kg of milk each day.

3. Now, we calculate the total milk produced by the sheep that produce 1 kg each day:
   \[
   15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. Then, we calculate the total milk produced by the sheep that produce 2 kg each day:
   \[
   15 \text{ sheep} \times 2 \text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. Finally, we add the two amounts together to find the total milk collected every day:
   \[
   15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg}
   \]

So, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of pupils in the class**: 40

2. **Number of pupils who like blue**:
   - Half of the class likes blue.
   - So, \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \) pupils like blue.

3. **Number of pupils remaining after those who like blue are accounted for**:
   - Total pupils - Pupils who like blue = \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) pupils.

4. **Number of pupils who like green**:
   - One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green.
   - So, \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) pupils like green.

5. **Number of pupils who like yellow**:
   - The rest of the pupils like yellow.
   - So, \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) pupils like yellow.

**Final answer**: 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"First, let's determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she got $56 from selling the apples at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
\]

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24
\]

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the apples picked each day:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
\]

Since the apples picked on Monday were all sold, the number of apples picked on Monday is the same as the number sold, which is 14. So, we have:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50
\]

Thus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many socks Lindsay has washed. Since 1 pair of socks consists of 2 socks, washing 10 pairs means she has washed:

\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks/pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

Additionally, she has washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is:

\[ 20 \text{ socks} + 15 \text{ socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:

\[ 50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks} \]

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"First, let's add the cookies Rachel bought and the cookies Janet gave her:

23 (bought by Rachel) + 42 (given by Janet) = 65 cookies

So, Rachel has 21 cookies left."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she has to repay and then divide it by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest on the loan. The interest rate is 10%, and the principal amount is $3,650. The formula to calculate simple interest is:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the time is in years, so we need to convert 5 months into years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 5 months is \( \frac{5}{12} \) years.

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 152.085 \]

So, the total interest is approximately $152.09.

Now, we add this interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan has to repay:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.09 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.09 \]

Karan has to pay this total amount over 5 months, so we divide the total amount by 5 to find the monthly payment:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.09}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month."
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances they hiked:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

Final numerical answer:
67"
"First, let's determine how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel. Since Axel has 50 silver pesos, Anna has:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel. Since Axel has 80 gold pesos, Anna has:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

Axel's total silver pesos:
\[ 50 \]

Anna's total silver pesos:
\[ 100 \]

Combined total silver pesos:
\[ 50 + 100 = 150 \]

Axel's total gold pesos:
\[ 80 \]

Anna's total gold pesos:
\[ 120 \]

Combined total gold pesos:
\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \]

Finally, the total number of pesos they have together is the sum of the combined silver and gold pesos:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \]

So, the total number of pesos they have together is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups of lemonade is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out the total cost. Millie spent $18 on supplies. So, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups. The time taken to sell all the lemonade is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total hours:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let's say Mr. Ruther originally had \( x \) hectares of land. According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. So, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \). We can do this by isolating \( x \) on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther originally had \(\boxed{32}\) hectares of land."
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls are in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members:

- Number of boys = 52 * 50% = 52 * 0.5 = 26
- Number of girls = 52 * 50% = 52 * 0.5 = 26

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are planning to perform.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can't make it is:

- Girls who can't make it = 26 * 50% = 26 * 0.5 = 13

Therefore, the number of girls who actually perform is:

- Girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so we add these 3 teachers to the number of girls performing:

- Total people who sang = 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16

So, the final number of people who sang in the performance is:

16"

Let's do the addition step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total of the scores is 400. Now, we divide this total by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is:
\[ 80 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount.

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate the discount Tim gets by bundling these services. The discount is 20%, so we need to find 20% of $30:
\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for the bundled services is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

"First, let's calculate the energy used by the air conditioner per day before the reduction.

Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, and it uses 900 watts per hour. So, the daily energy usage is:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours/day} \times 900 \, \text{watts/hour} = 7200 \, \text{watts/day} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy usage to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts/day} \div 1000 = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \]

Next, we calculate the energy saved by reducing the usage by 5 hours a day. The new daily usage is:
\[ 3 \, \text{hours/day} \times 900 \, \text{watts/hour} = 2700 \, \text{watts/day} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts/day} \div 1000 = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \]

The energy saved per day is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts/day} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts/day} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \]

Finally, to find out how much energy is saved in 30 days:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the total energy saved in 30 days is:
\[ 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]"

- For the two zebras with 17 stripes each: \( 2 \times 17 = 34 \) stripes.
- The zebra with 36 stripes: \( 36 \) stripes.
- The zebra with 18 stripes: \( 18 \) stripes.

Adding these together gives the total number of stripes:
\[ 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of stripes. There are 5 zebras in total. The average is calculated by dividing the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{88}{5} = 17.6 \]

So, the average number of stripes per zebra is:
\[ 17.6 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 17.6 \]"
"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - There are 20 people in total.
   - Number of sandwiches needed = \( \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \).

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat needed = \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of cheese needed = \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of meat = \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   - The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of cheese = \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \).

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = \( 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is **$50**."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).
3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, so he bought \(60 - 40 = 20\) more corns. Therefore, the new total of corns is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

- Total cannolis: 100
- Total corns: 100

So, the combined total is \(100 + 100 = 200\).

**Final Answer: 200**"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked \( \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \) steps.
3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.

First, let's calculate the total steps Elliott had taken before his jog:
- Steps from walking to and from school: 5,000
- Steps from the short walk with his friend: 1,000

Total steps before the jog: \( 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \)

Since he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps, the steps he took during his jog can be calculated as:
- Total goal: 10,000
- Steps left after the jog: 2,000

Steps taken during the jog: \( 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 \)

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

2,000"
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read the book. Since he reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, and it takes him 30 minutes to read the book. After reading, it takes him an additional 10 minutes to get to the airport. So, the total time he will spend is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, and he will spend 40 minutes on these activities, he will be:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Payment per employee per hour: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment per employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} = 600 \, \text{dollars/employee} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 600 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 24000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of employees in June.**

- Number of employees who left in June: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \, \text{employees} \]

- Number of employees remaining in June:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Payment per employee per hour: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment per employee in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} = 600 \, \text{dollars/employee} \]

Total payment for all employees in June:
\[ 600 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 18000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total payment for both months.**

Total payment for May and June:

\[ 42000 \, \text{dollars} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means for 2 pounds, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since 1/2 off of $3 is $1.50).

So, the cost of the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Since she bought 4 magnets, the total cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, we add up all the expenses:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the final amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's find out how much the second pack of fireworks costs. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times \$400 = \$800 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the first pack and the second pack together:

\[ \$400 + \$800 = \$1200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the fireworks before the discount. We add the cost of the finale firework:

\[ \$1200 + \$150 = \$1350 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the total cost. We calculate 80% of \$1350:

\[ 0.80 \times \$1350 = \$1080 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \$1080 \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. 

For 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens she needs to make 60 cookies:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies. 

**Final Answer:**

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem doesn't provide a direct percentage for candles that will explode. Instead, it gives us the percentage of candles that smell like wet dog, which is 5% of the more dangerous candles. But since we don't have a specific percentage for the candles that will explode, we can only calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog.

Given:
- Marcy makes 50,000 candles.
- 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, we calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50,000 = \frac{5}{100} \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

So, 2,500 candles will smell like wet dog.

Since the problem does not provide a specific percentage for the candles that will explode, we cannot determine the exact number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode. However, based on the information given, the number of candles that will smell like wet dog is:

\[ \boxed{2500} \]"
"First, let's find out the discount price for each blouse. Since the blouses are on a 30% off rack, we need to calculate 30% of the regular price of $20.

To find 30% of $20, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Discount} = \text{Regular Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]

So,
\[ \text{Discount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

This means each blouse is discounted by $6. Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to find the sale price:
\[ \text{Sale Price} = \text{Regular Price} - \text{Discount} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the sale price:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Sale Price} \times \text{Number of Blouses} = 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let's say Joanne gathers \(x\) apples from the average trees.
4. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
5. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
6. Joanne's sister gathers no apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, we can write the equation for the total apples as:

\[ \text{Apples gathered by Joanne} + \text{Apples gathered by her sister} = 500 \]

Joanne's total apples are:
\[ 30 + 15 + x \]

Her sister's total apples are:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 30 + 15 + x + 105 = 500 \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Solve for \(x\):
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of camels.
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we can write the following equations:
\[ c + d = 180 \]
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

We can solve these equations step by step. First, let's subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days, so:

\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled in the next two days, which was 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:

\[ 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km.

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so:

\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance traveled during the two-week trip:

\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the size of Zack's locker:**
   - We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
   - Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker.
   - Therefore, Zack's locker is \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cubic inches.

2. **Determine the size of Timothy's locker:**
   - Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
   - Therefore, Timothy's locker is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cubic inches.

So, the size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge at 6,000 feet (since it fell 4,000 feet from 10,000 feet). Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb from 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet.

To find out how many feet Oliver must climb, we subtract Oliver's current elevation from the elevation of the comb:

\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

So, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet.

3,000 feet"
"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money the second bank gave Mr. Josue.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital he had.

First, the first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

So, the final amount of capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cats**: There were 50 cats on the rock.

2. **Cats taken away by boats**: Four boats came and each carried away 5 cats.
   - Total cats taken away = \(4 \times 5 = 20\)
   - Remaining cats = \(50 - 20 = 30\)

3. **Cats that ran after a mouse**: \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining cats ran after a mouse.
   - Number of cats that ran = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \)
   - Remaining cats on the rock = \(30 - 18 = 12\)

So, the final number of cats left on the rock is **12**."
"To find out how much 2 years of the streaming service cost Bill, we need to break down the costs month by month.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[

"First, let's find the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to determine the total savings Cole made. The problem states that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( S_{tattered} \) be the savings from the tattered jeans and \( S_{jogger} \) be the savings from the jogger jeans. We know:

\[ S_{tattered} + S_{jogger} = 6 \]
\[ S_{jogger} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_{tattered} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and Cole saved $4 on them, so the sale price of the tattered jeans is:

\[ 28 - 4 = 24 \]

The original price of the jogger jeans is $22, and Cole saved $2 on them, so the sale price of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 22 - 2 = 20 \]

Now, we need to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"

1. **Buses:**
   - There are 4 buses.
   - Each bus can hold 60 employees.
   - Total capacity of buses = \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees.

2. **Minibusses:**
   - There are 6 minibusses.
   - Each minibus can hold 30 employees.
   - Total capacity of minibusses = \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees.

3. **Minivans:**
   - There are 10 minivans.
   - Each minivan can hold 15 employees.
   - Total capacity of minivans = \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees.

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:

\[
240 \text{ (buses)} + 180 \text{ (minibusses)} + 150 \text{ (minivans)} = 570 \text{ employees}

"First, let's determine the number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder.

- Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds.
- Each bird feeder Lillian made attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each homemade feeder attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Lillian has:
- 3 homemade bird feeders.
- 3 store-bought bird feeders.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:
\[ 90 \text{ birds} + 60 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the ticket:**
   - The ticket costs $100.

2. **Determine how much money Kenny has left after buying the ticket:**
   - Kenny has $50 in spending cash after buying the ticket.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he made from selling the cards is $100 (ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150.

3. **Determine how many cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

4. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - The number of cards he sold is 2/3 of \( x \), which is 100 cards.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- Each of the 5 separate utensils costs $5.00, so 5 utensils cost \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we determine how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's find out how much gas was in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gas Josey needed in gallons. Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container has 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. 

**Final Answer:**
6 pints"
"First, let's figure out how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as follows:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

This means George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

**Final Answer:**
5"
"First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray originally had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Next, we need to divide these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide 20 by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of Ray's friends received \(\boxed{5}\) lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces and she cuts it into 8 pieces. If Rory and her mom each have one piece, that's 2 pieces in total.

Each piece would weigh:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

So, 2 pieces would weigh:
\[ 2.5 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake would weigh:
\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

**Final Answer: 15 ounces**"
"First, let's find out the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to share these 56 oranges equally among Sitti, Juris, and their 6 other friends. This means the oranges will be shared among 8 people in total (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, so he needs:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The cost of the onions is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, so:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. We know that Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's.

So, Bernadette's drive time is:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's departure time to account for her longer travel time.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Bernadette should leave 9 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

**Final Answer: 9 minutes**"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width by rearranging the formula:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"

- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads per pack} = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:

- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads per pack} = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other:

\[ 140 \text{ beads (Margareth)} - 60 \text{ beads (Elizabeth)} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Since Marcus bakes for 3 hours, the temperature increase is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial temperature:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 3 \text{ intervals}
   \]
   The total cooling effect is:
   \[
   3 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

So, the final temperature of the house is:
\[
\boxed{49}

"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

1. **Swim:**
   Jon's time: 40 minutes

2. **Bike Ride:**
   Jon's time: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes

3. **Run:**
   Jon's time: 50 minutes

Now, let's sum up Jon's total time:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 80 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finished 10% faster in the swim and 5 minutes longer on the bike.

4. **Swim:**
   James's time: \( 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \text{ minutes} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \)

5. **Bike Ride:**
   James's time: \( 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \)

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 \text{ minutes} + 85 \text{ minutes} + x = 170 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 121 \text{ minutes} + x = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 180 \text{ minutes} - 121 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ x = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59 \text{ minutes}} \]"
"First, let's find out the length of Movie C. Since Movie C is given in hours, we need to convert it to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie C} = 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is:

\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes."
"First, let's find out how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how much hay the horse eats. The horse eats \(\frac{1}{2}\) a bail of hay for every mile it runs. So, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail per mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars per bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

To find out how much change he has after buying the hay, we subtract the total cost of the hay from the amount of money he has:
\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{dollars} - 24 \, \text{dollars} = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also has 2 additional eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 5:

\[
\frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:

\[
\frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

Therefore, Rozanne can put out \(\boxed{2}\) trays."
"First, let's calculate Joey's new total points after his turn in Scrabble. Joey originally has 214 points and scores an additional 26 points.

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new total points after her turn. Marcy originally has 225 points and scores an additional 10 points.

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

So, Marcy now has 235 points.

To find out by how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's new total from Joey's new total.

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

Joey is now winning by 5 points.

"First, let's calculate the cost per sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since he started with 48 sneakers and sold 17 at the flash sale, the remaining sneakers are:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

The revenue from selling these 31 sneakers to the department store at $25 each is:

\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from selling all the sneakers is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost is $576, so the profit is:

\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost for super ticket option: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost of Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's call the regular price of popcorn \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost for regular ticket option: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by choosing the regular ticket option.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option is $2 less than the super ticket option.
   - So, $21 (super ticket) - $2 (savings) = $19 (regular ticket option)

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - We know the regular ticket option costs $19.
   - So, $15 + \( P \) = $19

5. **Solving for \( P \):**
   - \( P \) = $19 - $15
   - \( P \) = $4

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"First, let's find the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. So, the cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. The total cost for 170 balloons is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65 \]

To calculate this, we can break it down:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5) \]
\[ 170 \times 60 = 10200 \]
\[ 170 \times 5 = 850 \]
\[ 10200 + 850 = 11050 \]

So, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil needed for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height. So, for one raised bed:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil needed} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags needed} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. If there are 15 red cards and there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (60\% \times 15) \]

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 15 = 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of green cards is:

\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many yellow cards there are. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we add up all the cards:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Therefore, the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible position, which is 8th place (since there are only 8 positions if we start counting from 1).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(8 + 2 = 10\). Again, since there are only 8 positions, we adjust this to 8th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(8 - 3 = 5\). So, she is now in 5th place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(5 + 1 = 6\). So, she finished in 6th place.

Therefore, Finley finished in 6th place."
"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

\[ 6 \text{ decks} \times 25 \text{ cards/deck} = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards she has:

\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

So, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each and received a $1 discount.

The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

After the $1 discount, Becky paid:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount.

The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

A 10 percent discount on $10 is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, after the 10 percent discount, Kelly paid:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[ 9 - 8 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky."
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of each item per room:**
   - Each room has 2 sheets.
   - Each room has 1 comforter.
   - Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
   - Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

2. **Calculate the total number of each item for 80 rooms:**
   - Sheets: \(2 \times 80 = 160\)
   - Comforters: \(1 \times 80 = 80\)
   - Pillow cases: \(4 \times 80 = 320\)
   - Towels: \(8 \times 80 = 640\)

3. **Add up all the pieces of laundry:**
   \[
   160 \text{ (sheets)} + 80 \text{ (comforters)} + 320 \text{ (pillow cases)} + 640 \text{ (towels)} = 1200
   \]

So, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is **1200**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of shoes**: Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Shoes received on Monday**: He gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he gets \(5 \times 2 = 10\) shoes.
   - Total shoes after Monday: \(200 + 10 = 210\)

3. **Shoes received on Wednesday**: He gains 15 pairs of shoes.
   - Total shoes after Wednesday: \(210 + (15 \times 2) = 210 + 30 = 240\)

4. **Shoes received on Friday**: He gains 30 pairs of shoes.
   - Total shoes after Friday: \(240 + (30 \times 2) = 240 + 60 = 300\)

5. **Shoes removed on Saturday**: He gets rid of 180 shoes.
   - Total shoes after Saturday: \(300 - 180 = 120\)

So, the final number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is **120**."
"First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, we multiply 8 by 6:

\[ 8 \times 6 = 48 \]

So, Mary can decorate 48 cupcakes with all her sprinkles.

Next, we need to determine how many pans worth of cupcakes she should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

\[ 48 \div 12 = 4 \]

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes. 

Final numerical answer:
4"
"First, let's find out how much the piece of paper cost.

The pen cost $2. Three times the price of the pen is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

The piece of paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen, so:
\[ 6 - 1 = 5 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the pen and the piece of paper to find the total cost:
\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \]

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount given:

"First, let's find out how many pencils were there initially.

There are 30 students, and each started with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils at the start is:
\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

This means the number of pencils left after two months is:
\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"First, let's find the combined length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the total length of the remoras is:

\[ 6 \, \text{inches} \times 2 = 12 \, \text{inches} \]

Next, we need to convert the shark's body length from feet to inches to make the units consistent. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the shark's body length in inches is:

\[ 10 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{inches/foot} = 120 \, \text{inches} \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Here, the ""part"" is the combined length of the remoras (12 inches), and the ""whole"" is the shark's body length (120 inches). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ \left( \frac{12 \, \text{inches}}{120 \, \text{inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is:

\[ 10\% \]"
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have desktop computers. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have desktop computers. We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]
\[
x = 80

Sarah gave an equal number of these books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child got, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids:

\[ \text{Books per child} = \frac{20 \text{ books}}{4 \text{ kids}} = 5 \text{ books per child} \]

Each child got 5 books."
"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to first figure out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the things (dairy or peanuts).

1. We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 are allergic to peanuts.
2. However, 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts. If we just add 9 and 6, we would be counting those 3 kids twice. So, we need to subtract 3 from the total to avoid double-counting.

So, the number of kids allergic to at least one of these is:
\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

**Final Answer:**
20"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to add the number of employees to the number of tour guides.

\[ 3 \times 200 = 600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group has 7 tour guides.
- There are 3 groups.

So, the total number of tour guides is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to get the total number of people going on the tour:
\[ 600 + 21 = 621 \]

Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is:
\[ 621 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend.

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend, we need to find 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price.

20% of $1500 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 1500 = 300 \]

So, the cost of the hotel per day during the busy weekend is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. The cost of each plane ticket is $5000, and since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"
"First, let's determine how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, we calculate:

\[ \text{Tubes of blue paint Jasper has} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Next, we calculate how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, and Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, we calculate:

\[ \text{Tubes of yellow paint Jasper has} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Now, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint that Jasper has to find the total number of tubes of paint:

\[ \text{Total tubes of paint Jasper has} = 2 + 9 = 11 \]

"First, let's find out how many songs Luri has on her player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of songs Luri has} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to determine how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can hold up to 100 songs:

- The number of songs Gabriel can still add is:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

- The number of songs Luri can still add is:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's find out how many miles James runs in a week. He runs 12 miles a day for 5 days, so:

\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours he runs in a week. If he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can calculate the total hours by dividing the total miles by his speed:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs 6 hours a week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of oats one horse consumes in one day. Since each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, one horse eats:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of oats all four horses consume in one day. Since there are four horses:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we find out how much oats all four horses consume in five days:

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 200 pounds of oats:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

2. Divide the sum by the number of countries (which is 3).

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48 degrees Fahrenheit
- Northlandia: 21 degrees Fahrenheit
- Midlandia: -3 degrees Fahrenheit

First, we add these temperatures together:
\[
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -30

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So, the family-size pizza costs $24.

Next, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount Sally spends:

\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Therefore, Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's calculate the total cost before any discounts. Each pack of razors costs $4.00, and Heather is buying 2 packs.

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00 \]

Since the razors are on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer, Heather only pays for one pack but gets two. So, the cost for 2 packs is still $4.00 (the price of one pack).

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the $4.00 cost.

\[ \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00 \]

This is the total cost for 2 packs of razors after the coupon. Now, we need to find the cost per razor. Each pack contains 4 razors, so 2 packs contain:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors} \]

The cost per razor is then:

\[ \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.25 to cents:

\[ \$0.25 = 25 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per individual razor is:

\[ 25 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total height of the cheerleaders in the human pyramid.

9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and 1 cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The total height of the 9 cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall is:
\[ 9 \times 64 = 576 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the 10th cheerleader is:
\[ 60 \text{ inches} \]

So, the total height of all 10 cheerleaders is:
\[ 576 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

In the human pyramid, the 4 cheerleaders on the bottom, 3 on top of them, 2 on top of the 3, and the shortest (60 inches tall) at the top. The height of the pyramid is the height of the shortest cheerleader at the top, which is 60 inches.

Now, we need to convert 60 inches to feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we have:
\[ 60 \div 12 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Since Brett's current age is 14, three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

Angela is currently 38 years old. 

**Angela is currently 38 years old.**"
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to calculate the total cost for both the morning and afternoon rides over 14 days.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- So, the total cost for morning rides is \( 6 \times 14 = 84 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- So, the total cost for afternoon rides is \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for both morning and afternoon rides:
- Total cost for morning rides: $84
- Total cost for afternoon rides: $28
- Total cost for both rides: \( 84 + 28 = 112 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:

"First, let's find out how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's add the oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne to find the total number of oranges:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can find out how many pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ 120 \text{ oranges} \div 3 \text{ oranges/pie} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( x \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (which includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal. So, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides of the equation:
   \[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
   \[ 200 = 20x \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
   \[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
   \[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's define the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"First, let's find out how many yards of yarn Mariah used. Since she used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein and there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate how many yards Mariah's grandma used. She used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, to find out how many yards of yarn they used altogether, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma:

\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Cherrie has 2 friends who each want 5 gifts.
   - So, for these 2 friends: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts.

2. Cherrie has 3 friends who each want 2 gifts.
   - So, for these 3 friends: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts.

3. Cherrie decides to get 10 more random gifts.
   - So, the additional gifts: \(10\) gifts.

Now, let's add all these together:

- Gifts for the first 2 friends: \(10\)
- Gifts for the next 3 friends: \(6\)
- Additional random gifts: \(10\)

Total number of gifts = \(10 + 6 + 10 = 26\)

So, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts."
"First, let's find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ 3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we calculate twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:

\[ 2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} \]
\[ 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost for all four packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented by the equation:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber. The 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks, while the 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks.

Given Frederick has $24 to spend, he should buy as many 2 x 4 pieces as possible since they are cheaper.

First, calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces he can buy with $24:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

So, he can buy 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood. Each piece of 2 x 4 wood gives him 200 sticks, so:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:
\[ 1200 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of legs Mario's dogs have. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Janet spends on bus trips without the weekly pass.

Janet takes 2 bus trips each day and does this 5 days a week. So, the total number of trips she makes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each trip costs $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \]

Now, let's see how much she would spend if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20. With the pass, she would only pay $20 for the entire week, regardless of the number of trips.

To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the weekly pass from the total cost of the trips:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, let's find out how many cows the zoo has. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, let's find out how many sheep the farm has. Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo.

For the farm:
\[ 30 \text{ cows} + 10 \text{ sheep} = 40 \text{ animals} \]

For the zoo:
\[ 60 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ sheep} = 80 \text{ animals} \]

Adding the total number of animals from both the farm and the zoo:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

So, the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to start by understanding the relationship between the quantities Rose and Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
- Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

First, let's determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times what Sophia bought, we can set up the following equations:

For onions:
\[ \text{Number of onions Rose bought} = 4 \times \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} \]
\[ 12 = 4 \times \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} \]
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

For potatoes:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Rose bought} = 4 \times \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} \]
\[ 4 = 4 \times \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} \]
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Now, we add the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought to find the total:
\[ \text{Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought} = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

So, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs:**
   - Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, for 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
     \[
     3500 \, \text{calories/pound} \times 30 \, \text{pounds} = 105,000 \, \text{calories}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal:**
   - Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to count the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.
   - From December 31st to July 19th, we have:
     - 31 days in December
     - 31 days in January
     - 28 days in February (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - 31 days in March
     - 30 days in April
     - 31 days in May
     - 19 days in June
     - 19 days in July (up to July 19th)
   - Adding these up:
     \[
     31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 19 + 19 = 210 \, \text{days}
     \]

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit needed:**
   - To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days:
     \[
     \frac{105,000 \, \text{calories}}{210 \, \text{days}} = 500 \, \text{calories/day}
     \]

So, Andy needs to have a calorie deficit of **500 calories** each day to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate his total earnings for the week as follows:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying clothes.

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying CDs.

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To find out how much the house cost, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's say the cost of the lot is \( L \) dollars. According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so the cost of the house is \( 3L \) dollars.

The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000. So we can write the equation:
\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

So, the cost of the lot is $30,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is:
\[ 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the house cost is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so the total number of bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for 8 packs is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling 40 bags is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes in a fight.
2. Multiply the total number of minutes by the number of punches Joe throws per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes in a fight. A fight consists of 5 rounds, and each round lasts 3 minutes. So, we multiply the number of rounds by the duration of each round:

\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Joe throws 25 punches per minute. To find the total number of punches, we multiply the total number of minutes by the number of punches per minute:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes} \times 25 \text{ punches/minute} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{375} \]"

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount of money after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine how many quarts of strawberries each person can pick per hour.

1. **Tony** can pick 6 quarts per hour.
2. **Bobby** picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks:
   \[
   6 - 1 = 5 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]
3. **Kathy** picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy picks:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]
4. **Ricky** picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ quarts per hour}

"First, let's calculate Ada's current daily electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. If we assume she uses this for 24 hours a day (which is a common assumption for daily consumption unless specified otherwise), her daily consumption is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 288 \, \text{kWh} \]

The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her daily cost is:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$432 \]

Now, let's calculate her new daily consumption after adding the device. The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so her new daily consumption is:
\[ (12 + 2) \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 14 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 336 \, \text{kWh} \]

The new daily cost is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$504 \]

Next, we calculate the weekly cost before and after adding the device. There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly cost before adding the device is:
\[ \$432 \times 7 = \$3024 \]

The weekly cost after adding the device is:
\[ \$504 \times 7 = \$3528 \]

Finally, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

So, the difference is:
\[ \boxed{504} \]"
"First, let's figure out how long it takes one person to paint a whole house.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then to paint a whole house, it would take:
\[ 5 \, \text{days} \times 2 = 10 \, \text{days} \]

Now, if one person takes 10 days to paint a whole house, we need to find out how long it would take for 5 people to do the same job.

Since 5 people are working together, they can do the work 5 times faster than one person. Therefore, the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house is:
\[ \frac{10 \, \text{days}}{5} = 2 \, \text{days} \]

Now, we need to convert the 2 days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:
\[ 2 \, \text{days} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 48 \, \text{hours} \]

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

**Final Answer:**
48 hours"
"First, let's figure out how many chairs Ophelia has. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, and she has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, we can calculate the number of chairs Jenna has:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} \]
\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can calculate the number of sofas Jenna has:

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs they have by adding up all the sofas and chairs:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]

\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} \]
\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = \text{Total number of sofas} + \text{Total number of chairs} \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is **172**."
"First, let's find out the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom paid $48 in total and $4 for the CD. So, the cost of the headphone set is:

\[ \$48 - \$4 = \$44 \]

Now, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had $44 more to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we can find out how many more CDs he could buy by dividing the amount of money he would have had left by the cost of one CD:

\[ \$44 \div \$4 = 11 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

2. **First stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - 5 times as many passengers as those who got off get on the bus.
   - Number of passengers getting on: \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

   So, after the first stop:
   - Passengers getting off: 8
   - Passengers getting on: 40
   - Total change in passengers: \(40 - 8 = 32\)
   - New number of passengers: \(48 + 32 = 80\)

3. **Second stop:**
   - 21 passengers get off the bus.
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than those who got off.
   - Number of passengers getting on: \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

   So, after the second stop:
   - Passengers getting off: 21
   - Passengers getting on: 7
   - Total change in passengers: \(7 - 21 = -14\)
   - New number of passengers: \(80 - 14 = 66\)

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[ 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 \]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find out how many years separate Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:
\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400.
- The computer cost $1,100.
- The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

Let's calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, we know the total cost and the individual costs of the computer and the printer. We can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1100 - 700 = 600 \]

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls. Since there are 20 kids and they were divided into two equal groups, we have:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we know that each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the number of seashells each girl brought is the number of seashells each boy brought plus four times the number of seashells each boy brought. Let's denote the number of seashells each girl brought as \( G \). According to the problem:

\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

So, each girl brought back 300 seashells. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many candies George originally had. Since George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, we can find out how many he had initially by adding the 5 candies he ate to the 3 candies he has now:

\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

So, George originally had 8 candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can calculate the number of candies Nick had by multiplying the number of candies George originally had by 2:

\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \]

Therefore, Nick has \(\boxed{16}\) candies."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Chenny is 10 years old.
2. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so Alyana's age is:
   \[
   10 - 4 = 6 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne's age is:
   \[
   6 + 2 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

So, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, let's calculate the thickness of each book step by step.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so:
   \[
   50 \, \text{mm} - 5 \, \text{mm} = 45 \, \text{mm}
   \]
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \, \text{mm} = 62 \, \text{mm}
   \]

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books together:
\[
31 \, \text{mm} + 50 \, \text{mm} + 45 \, \text{mm} + 62 \, \text{mm}
\]

Let's do the addition step by step:
\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]
\[
81 + 45 = 126
\]
\[
126 + 62 = 188
\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is:
\[
\boxed{188 \, \text{mm}}

"First, let's add up the number of vlogs Emma has already made in the first three weeks:

- First week: 18 vlogs
- Second week: 21 vlogs
- Third week: 15 vlogs

Total vlogs made in the first three weeks = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

72 (goal) - 54 (already made) = 18 vlogs

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

**Final Answer: 18**"
"First, let's calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill.

20% of $50 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the tip amount is $10.

Now, add the tip to the original bill to find the total amount:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since you are paying the full amount including the tip, the final amount you end up paying is:
\[ \$60 \]"
"First, let's find out how much each boy initially gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys.

\[ \text{Initial share per boy} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

The eldest boy starts with $6. He then adds $5 to his share:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]

The following day, he adds another $10:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

He then spends $8:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \]

After spending $8, he triples the amount he has left:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is:

\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Define the daily savings:**
   Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half:**
   Since he saves \( x \) each day for 15 days, the total savings for the first half is:
   \[
   15x
   \]

5. **Determine the daily savings for the second half:**
   Elvis wants to save twice as much each day in the second half. Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

6. **Calculate the total savings for the second half:**
   Since he saves \( 2x \) each day for 15 days, the total savings for the second half is:
   \[
   15 \times 2x = 30x
   \]

7. **Set up the equation for the total savings:**
   The total savings for the month should equal $1125. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125
   \]

8. **Combine like terms:**
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]

9. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

10. **Determine the daily savings for the second half:**
    Since \( x = 25 \), the daily savings for the second half is:
    \[
    2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
    \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit Verna bought.

For the apples:
3 apples * $1.50 each = $4.50

For the oranges:
5 oranges * $0.80 each = $4.00

For the peaches:
6 peaches * $0.75 each = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
$4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00

Verna gave $20.00. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, the final numerical answer is:
$7.00"
"First, let's calculate how much Jairus earns from 20 tasks. Since Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, we multiply $0.8 by 20:

\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, Jairus earns $16.

Next, let's calculate how much Jenny earns from 20 tasks. Since Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, we multiply $0.5 by 20:

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

So, Jenny earns $10.

Now, to find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jairus gets $6 more than Jenny.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's use a variable to represent the amount of money Brad gets. Let's say Brad gets \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4x \) dollars.

The total amount of money they are dividing is 100 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 100 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as follows:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"Jeff walks to work and back home each day, which is a total of 3 miles + 3 miles = 6 miles per day.

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is **130**."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the number of families notified grows with each round of calls.

1. **First Round**: Ali calls 3 families.
2. **Second Round**: Each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are notified.
3. **Third Round**: Each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are notified.
4. **Fourth Round**: Each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are notified.

So, during the fourth round of calls, **81 families** will be notified."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

1. Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months.
2. Total weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds.
3. His final weight is 70 pounds.

To find his initial weight, we add the total weight lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"First, let's find out how many toys are in a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys.

So, five times larger than James's play set would be:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have 400 toys. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys to have 400 toys, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Daniel gets a 10% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount:

\[10\% \text{ of } 30.00 = 0.10 \times 30.00 = 3.00\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:

\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

So, Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy.

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. **Calculate the commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission amount = $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

2. **Calculate the commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
   - Commission rate for the amount over $1000 is 10%.
   - Commission amount = $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

3. **Calculate the total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission for the first $1000 + Commission for the amount over $1000.
   - Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, the amount of money Antonella earned is **$450**."
"First, let's calculate how many water bottles Bill already has. He has 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he has is:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles per case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles Bill needs in total for his 70 guests, with each guest getting 2 bottles. So, the total number of bottles needed is:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles per guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

"First, let's figure out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. When the water is warm, it takes him 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes in cold water. 

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water compared to cold water.

In cold water, swimming 3 miles would take:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

In warm water, swimming 3 miles would take:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and in cold water is:

- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, let's calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = number of hamsters + number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

So, the pet shop has a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's find out how much Susan weighs. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, and Mark weighs 150 pounds, we can calculate Susan's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Susan's weight} = \text{Mark's weight} - 20 \]
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 \]
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Bob weighs. Since Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, we can calculate Bob's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times \text{Susan's weight} \]
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 \]
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we have the weights of all three friends:
- Mark: 150 pounds
- Susan: 130 pounds
- Bob: 260 pounds

To find the average weight, we add up all their weights and then divide by the number of friends, which is 3:

\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average weight} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the angle of the sun changes over time.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Rate of Change**: The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour straight upward.

3. **Time Passed**: The sun moves for 10 hours.

Now, we calculate the total angle the sun moves upward in 10 hours:
\[ \text{Total angle moved} = 5 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{degrees} \]

4. **Final Angle of the Sun**: We add this total angle to the initial angle of the sun:
\[ \text{Final angle} = 32 \, \text{degrees} + 50 \, \text{degrees} = 82 \, \text{degrees} \]

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is:
\[ \boxed{82} \]"
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. So, the age of the younger son is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs one candle per year, the total number of candles required is:

\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

Now, we need to figure out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

\[ 20 \div 5 = 4 \]

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total amount James spends on candles is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read each night in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night.

Since there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the reading rate as:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \]

Using this rate, the number of pages she read in the first week is:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \times 105 \text{ minutes} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages from both weeks:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

"First, let's find out how many sandwiches Cody ate. Since Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

Next, let's determine how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Since Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

So, Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

Now, we add the number of sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate to find the total number of sandwiches consumed:

\[
4 + 3 = 7
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches consumed from the original number of sandwiches to find out how many are left:

\[
12 - 7 = 5
\]

So, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Shiloh's age in 7 years:**
   - Shiloh is currently 44 years old.
   - In 7 years, Shiloh will be \(44 + 7 = 51\) years old.

2. **Set up the relationship between Shiloh's age in 7 years and his nephew's age:**
   - In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.
   - Let \(x\) be the nephew's current age.
   - In 7 years, the nephew will be \(x + 7\) years old.
   - According to the problem, \(51 = 3(x + 7)\).

3. **Solve the equation for \(x\):**
   \[
   51 = 3(x + 7)
   \]
   - First, divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   \frac{51}{3} = x + 7
   \]
   - Simplify:
   \[
   17 = x + 7
   \]
   - Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   17 - 7 = x
   \]
   - Simplify:
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The nephew is currently 10 years old.

**Final Answer:**
The nephew is 10 years old today."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00.
   - Therefore, for three teeth, the total amount is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth.
   - Since the previous three teeth each received $1.00, half of that is \( \frac{1}{2} = 0.50 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, for two teeth, the total amount is \(2 \times 0.50 = 1\) dollar.

Now, let's add up all the amounts:

- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount = \(5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00\) dollars.

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of **$9.00**."
"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, let's start by figuring out how many goals Mark and Anna scored based on the information given.

1. **Richie's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 80 goals.

2. **Mark's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
   - Therefore, Mark scored \(80 - 20 = 60\) goals.

3. **Anna's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
   - Therefore, Anna scored \(80 - 45 = 35\) goals.

Now, we add up the goals scored by all three teenagers:
- Richie: 80 goals
- Mark: 60 goals
- Anna: 35 goals

Total goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[ 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

"First, let's calculate how much money Mitchell made from selling lemonade.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, the total amount of money Mitchell made is:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that Liam made $63 that weekend.

To find out how much more money Mitchell made compared to Liam, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made 21 more dollars than Liam that weekend."
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and he has $70 for the week, we divide $70 by 7 days:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \]

So, Peter spends $10 each day. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \]

This means he has:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \]

dollars left for the rest of the week. From Thursday to Sunday, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy with $30 is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Next, we calculate the number of wooden action figures he bought from Sunday through Wednesday. Since each wooden action figure costs $5 and he spent $10 each day for 4 days, the number of wooden action figures he bought is:

\[ \frac{10}{5} \times 4 = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Adding the wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Spaying cost**: $200
2. **Cost of 3 vaccines**: Each vaccine costs $20, so for 3 vaccines, the cost is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) dollars.
3. **Cost of broken vases**: Each vase costs $12, and the kitten broke 4 vases, so the cost is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[
200 + 60 + 48 = 308
\]

So, the total cost so far is \(\boxed{308}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops each week.

- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses per week} \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week. To find out how many more roses he needs each week to meet the demand, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses he needs:
\[ 65 - 40 = 25 \text{ roses per week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more roses he lacks in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly shortage by 4:
\[ 25 \times 4 = 100 \text{ roses} \]

So, Ford lacks \(\boxed{100}\) roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find out how much money Katina will have in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of money Katina removes from her account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total amount from her initial savings.

First, let's calculate the total amount removed over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years would have:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months} \]

Katina removes $100 each month, so over 24 months, she will remove:
\[ 24 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial savings of $3000:
\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \]

So, the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

### Step 1: Calculate the total revenue
- They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
- Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost
- Cost of bread: Each loaf costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
- Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 (since 1 loaf makes 10 sandwiches)
- Cost of different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00

- Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments
- Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

### Step 3: Calculate the net profit
- Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom. The area is found by multiplying the length by the width:

\[ \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding. The carpet and padding cost $12 per square foot for the carpet and $2 per square foot for the padding, so the total cost per square foot for the carpet and padding is:

\[ 12 + 2 = 14 \, \text{dollars per square foot} \]

Now, we multiply this cost by the area of the bedroom to find the total cost for the carpet and padding:

\[ 14 \, \text{dollars per square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 3024 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost for removing the old carpet. The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, so the total cost for removing the old carpet is:

\[ 4 \, \text{dollars per square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 864 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost for installing the new carpet. The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet, so the total cost for installation is:

\[ 34 \, \text{dollars per square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 7344 \, \text{dollars} \]

To find the total cost for replacing the carpet, we add the cost of the carpet and padding, the cost of removing the old carpet, and the cost of installation:

\[ 3024 \, \text{dollars} + 864 \, \text{dollars} + 7344 \, \text{dollars} = 11232 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.

2. **First Operation**: We need to add half of the starting value to the starting value.
   \[
   \text{Half of the starting value} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Starting value plus half the number} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

3. **Second Operation**: Divide the result by 5.
   \[
   \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

4. **Third Operation**: Multiply the result by the starting value minus 12.

"First, let's find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the actual temperature the oven will reach if it is 4% too hot. Let's denote the actual temperature the oven needs to reach as \( T \). Since the oven is 4% too hot, we have:

\[ T = 520 \times (1 + 0.04) = 520 \times 1.04 = 540.8 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to:

\[ \boxed{540.8} \]"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the lengths of both movies together.

First, let's convert the length of each movie into minutes:

- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is \(60 + 30 = 90\) minutes long.
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is 120 minutes, the second movie is \(120 + 5 = 125\) minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of the two movies together:

\[90 + 125 = 215\]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

**Final Answer:**
215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate how much 30% of Herb's house price is. Herb's house is worth $76,000.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

So, Juan's house is $22,800 less expensive than Herb's house. Therefore, the value of Juan's house is:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

Now, to find the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

The combined value of the two houses is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is 12, so Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought: \(12 \text{ (Judy's cups)} + 40 \text{ (friend's cups)} = 52\)
- Total dishes brought: \(24 \text{ (Judy's dishes)} + 44 \text{ (friend's dishes)} = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together:

- Total utensils: \(52 \text{ (cups)} + 68 \text{ (dishes)} = 120\)

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is **120**."
"First, let's find out the cost of one box of contacts with the discount. The original price of one box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off.

To find the discount amount:
\[ 100.00 \times \frac{10}{100} = 10.00 \]

So, the discount is $10.00. Now, subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

This means one box costs $90.00 when there's a 10% discount.

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost would be:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many single use contacts are in 2 boxes. Since one box contains 90 contacts:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

So, 2 boxes contain 180 contacts. To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Therefore, each contact will cost $1.00."
"First, let's calculate how many hours each person worked.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Now, let's calculate how much each person earned.

Jill earned:
- $10 per hour * 3 hours = $30

John earned:
- $10 per hour * 7 hours = $70

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
- She burns 500 calories/hour.
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She burns 600 calories/hour.
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Total calories burned from running = 600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's find the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]
\[ x = \frac{160000 \text{ ml} \cdot \text{calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]
\[ x = 800 \text{ ml} \]

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be written as \( R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be written as \( G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"

"To determine the total number of seats Alex needs, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. **Email Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people via email.
   - Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people invited by email is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Phone Invitations:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people from phone invitations is \(8\) (since the 8 friends are already counted in the 100 people invited via email).

Now, we sum up all the people:
- Initial 100 people invited via email.
- 200 additional people invited by the 100 people via email.
- 8 additional people (spouses) from the 10 friends called.

So, the total number of seats needed is:

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - A cup of mushrooms (100 grams) has 3 grams of protein.
   - So, the protein content per gram is \( \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} \).

2. **Calculate the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - If 1 gram of mushrooms has 0.03 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms will have \( 200 \times 0.03 = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \).

3. **Calculate the protein content per week:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.

   x = 2 \times (x - 5)
   \]
4. Now, let's solve this equation:
   \[
   x = 2x - 10
   \]
   Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   0 = x - 10
   \]
   Add 10 to both sides:
   \[
   x = 10
   \]
   So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

5. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
   \[
   10 + 3 = 13
   \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is \(2 \times \$2000 = \$4000\).
2. The extra cost for the porcelain crown is \$500.
3. Therefore, the total cost is \( \$4000 + \$500 = \$4500 \).

George has already paid a deposit of \$600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ \$4500 - \$600 = \$3900 \]

George earns \$15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn \$3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{\$3900}{\$15 \text{ per hour}} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.

**Final Answer:**
260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees.

According to the problem:
- One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees.
- Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:
- \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees
- \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Colby has in total.

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, 8 quarters are worth \(8 \times 25 = 200\) cents.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, 6 dimes are worth \(6 \times 10 = 60\) cents.
- Colby has 14 nickels. Since each nickel is worth 5 cents, 14 nickels are worth \(14 \times 5 = 70\) cents.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since each penny is worth 1 cent, 15 pennies are worth \(15 \times 1 = 15\) cents.

Now, let's add up all the money Colby has:
\[200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents}\]

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one gumball:
\[345 \div 5 = 69\]

So, Colby can buy \(\boxed{69}\) gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

1. Dogs have 4 legs each. There are 5 dogs.
   \[
   5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. Cats have 4 legs each. There are 2 cats.
   \[
   2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}
   \]

3. Birds have 2 legs each. There are 10 birds.
   \[
   10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}
   \]

Now, we add the legs from all the pets together:
\[
20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}
\]

So, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is:

"First, we need to find out what 50% of the 8-pound weight is. 

50% of 8 pounds is calculated as:
\[ 8 \times \frac{50}{100} = 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, when Jamaal increases the weight by 50%, the new weight is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, since the 12-pound weight is too heavy, he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds. So, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds:
\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight that Jamaal now uses is:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds} \]"

"First, let's find the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. To find the speed, we divide the distance by the time:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles.

Final answer:

"First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in one hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 45 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts together gives us the total amount of chocolates made by both in 12 hours:

"First, let's calculate how much money Patrick earned in the first four hours.

Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, in one hour, he earned:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$7.50 \]

Since he did this for four hours, his earnings for the first four hours are:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times \$7.50/\text{hour} = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate his earnings for the next two hours.

Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, in one hour, he earned:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$6.00 \]

Since he did this for two hours, his earnings for the next two hours are:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times \$6.00/\text{hour} = \$12.00 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both periods to find the total amount of money Patrick earned:
\[ \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of rotations per mile:**
   - Given: 2 miles = 725 rotations.
   - Therefore, 1 mile = 725 / 2 = 362.5 rotations.

2. **Calculate the number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - So, rotations per month = 400 miles * 362.5 rotations/mile = 145,000 rotations.

3. **Calculate the number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, rotations per year = 145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year.

4. **Calculate the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - So, the number of years = 10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years.

"First, let's determine the total number of washings per pump. According to the directions, 2 pumps give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings. So, the cost per washing is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since we need the cost per pump in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy.

The shirt costs $25 and there is a 30% discount on it. To find the discount amount:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts cost $35 and there is no discount mentioned for the shorts, so the price remains $35.

Now, let's add the cost of the shirt and the shorts:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the items is $52.50, which is more than what Joe has, he cannot buy both items with the money he has. However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically or there's a mistake in the problem setup, we can still calculate how much he would be short.

The amount Joe would be short by is:
\[ 52.50 - 50 = 2.50 \]

But since the question asks how much money Joe will have left, and he can't make the purchase, the answer is that he will have:
\[ 0 \]

Final answer:
\[ 0 \]"

     \[
     4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \text{ pound of butter}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of butter needed for a week:**
   - Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants every day for a week (7 days).
   - Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for a week is:
     \[
     7 \times 1 = 7 \text{ pounds of butter}
     \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.

\[
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} \times 150 \, \text{meters} = 29100 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.

\[
\text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} \times 490 \, \text{meters} = 95060 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Now, we find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:

\[
\text{Difference in cost} = 95060 \, \text{dollars} - 29100 \, \text{dollars} = 65960 \, \text{dollars}

So, it costs \(\boxed{65960}\) dollars more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Funding and Duration:**
   - John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - The research takes 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the total duration of the research is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) months.

2. **Funding for the Remaining Months:**
   - For the first 5 months, the funding is $100,000.
   - For the remaining \(50 - 5 = 45\) months, the funding per month is 50% more than the initial $100,000.
   - 50% more than $100,000 is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Cost for the first 5 months: \(5 \times 100,000 = 500,000\).
   - Cost for the remaining 45 months: \(45 \times 150,000 = 6,750,000\).

4. **Total Research Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 5 months + Cost for the remaining 45 months
   - Total cost = \(500,000 + 6,750,000 = 7,250,000\).

So, the total cost of John's research is **$7,250,000**."

   - To convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide by 1000:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
     \]

2. **Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h:**
   - There are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour).
   - To find the speed in Mb/h, we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h}
     \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed is **72 Mb per hour**."
"To find the total number of cars the tow truck towed in that week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days. Since the tow truck pulled ten cars each day for three days, we multiply 10 by 3:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed in the remaining four days. The tow truck pulled four fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days, so it towed \(10 - 4 = 6\) cars each day for the remaining four days. We multiply 6 by 4:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Now, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days to the number of cars towed in the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed in the week:
\[ 30 + 24 = 54 \]

So, the total number of cars the tow truck towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The roller coaster requires a height of 4 feet. To find out how much more Adam needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the height he needs to grow into inches:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches if he grows 2 inches per year:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will need to wait 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

**Final Answer:**
4"
"To find out how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost to the company for the cars:**
   - Each car costs the company $25,000.
   - James sold 10 cars.
   - Total cost to the company = \( 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars:**
   - Each car is sold for $25,000.
   - James sold 10 cars.
   - Total revenue = \( 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost to the company.
   - Profit = \( 250,000 - 250,000 = 0 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate James's commission:**
   - James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
   - Commission = \( 0.10 \times 0 = 0 \) dollars.

Therefore, the final amount James made is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"First, let's find out how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so the remaining 40% must be men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. Since the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel, and the diamond jewel costs $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, we subtract $400 from the price of the gold jewel:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we need to find the total price for all three jewels. We add the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

So, the total price for all three jewels is:

\[
\boxed{4800}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, we need to find the total number of stamps Max bought. We do this by adding the number of each type of stamp together:
\[
16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45
\]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it will take for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

1. First, determine the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Tom is driving 70 miles per hour and Bob is driving 55 miles per hour, the difference in their speeds is:
   \[
   70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}
   \]
   This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

2. Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to cover the 75-mile gap at this rate. We use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   Plugging in the values, we get:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, let's find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Darren} = \text{Fish caught by Naomi} - 6 \]
\[ \text{Fish caught by Darren} = 17 - 6 \]
\[ \text{Fish caught by Darren} = 11 \]

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Tommy} = \text{Fish caught by Darren} + 3 \]
\[ \text{Fish caught by Tommy} = 11 + 3 \]
\[ \text{Fish caught by Tommy} = 14 \]

So, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$60
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of classes} = 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10} = \$6
   \]

2. **Determine the maximum cost per class allowed by his parents:**
   \[
   \text{Maximum cost per class} = \$10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost if Manny misses some classes:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

4. **Set up the inequality to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss:**
   \[
   \frac{\$60}{10 - x} \leq \$10
   \]

5. **Solve the inequality:**
   \[
   \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
   \]
   Multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
   \[
   60 \leq 10(10 - x)
   \]
   Simplify the right side:
   \[
   60 \leq 100 - 10x
   \]
   Subtract 100 from both sides:
   \[
   -40 \leq -10x
   \]
   Divide both sides by -10 (and reverse the inequality sign):
   \[
   4 \geq x
   \]
   This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   x \leq 4
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's determine how many customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes:

\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ customers daily} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers each processes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

- Jewel processes:
\[ 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ customers weekly} \]

- Julie processes:
\[ 100 \times 7 = 700 \text{ customers weekly} \]

To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their weekly totals together:

\[ 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

So, the total weekly production for the two is:

\[ 1050 \]"
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, let's break down the information given:

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which means Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.

Since Reggie ran 20 miles and this is 3 miles more than what Lynn ran, we can find out how many miles Lynn ran by subtracting 3 miles from Reggie's total:

\[ \text{Lynn's miles} = 20 - 3 = 17 \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"First, let's find the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is:
\[ \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The cost for 5 apples is:
\[ 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

The cost for 5 oranges is:
\[ 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these together, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is:
\[ 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole Bob wants to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular hole can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: $30,000

2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500

3. **Leather Seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
   \[
   \text{Cost of Leather Seats} = \frac{7500}{3} = 2500
   \]

4. **Running Boards**: $500 less than the leather seats
   \[
   \text{Cost of Running Boards} = 2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]

5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: $1500

Now, let's add all these costs together to find the total cost of the truck:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Base Price} + \text{King Cab Upgrade} + \text{Leather Seats} + \text{Running Boards} + \text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package}
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 43500
\]

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is **$43,500**."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise.

1. Calculate the raise amount:
\[ \text{Raise amount} = 20000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 1000 \]

2. Calculate the new monthly salary:
\[ \text{New monthly salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

Next, we need to add the bonus, which is half a month's salary.

3. Calculate the bonus:
\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{21000}{2} = 10500 \]

4. Calculate the total monthly income including the bonus:
\[ \text{Total monthly income} = 21000 + 10500 = 31500 \]

Finally, we calculate the annual income by multiplying the total monthly income by 12.

5. Calculate the annual income:
\[ \text{Annual income} = 31500 \times 12 = 378000 \]

So, Tim will make \(\boxed{378000}\) dollars in a year."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits at $750 each:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the dress pants. Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit, so:
\[ \frac{750}{5} = 150 \]
Since he buys 10 dress pants:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the dress shirts. He buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he has 10 suits, so he buys:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
Each dress shirt costs $60, so:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \]

Finally, we add up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts:
\[ 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \]

So, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \boxed{10800} \]"
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the number of articles each website publishes individually and then add those numbers together.

First, let's calculate the number of articles published by the news website in February:
- The news website publishes 20 articles every day.
- February has 28 days.

So, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of articles published by the sister company in February:
- The sister company publishes 10 articles every day.
- February has 28 days.

So, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to find out how much flour is in three bags. Since each bag contains 16 kilograms, three bags will contain:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 16 \text{ kilograms per bag} = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:

\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked separately and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Time Alisa biked: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Time Stanley biked: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance biked by both:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

So, the total number of miles Alisa and Stanley biked is 79 miles."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes Bill to dig through the soil. Since he can dig 4 feet per hour through soil, and he needs to dig through 24 feet of soil, we can find the time by dividing the total feet of soil by the rate at which he digs through soil.

Time to dig soil = Total feet of soil / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Bill to dig through the clay. He digs through clay at half the rate he digs through soil, so his rate through clay is 2 feet per hour. He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig clay = Total feet of clay / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to find the total time.

Total time = Time to dig soil + Time to dig clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well."

"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each:
\[ 20 \text{ pomegranates} \times \$20 \text{ per pomegranate} = \$400 \]

She got a $2 discount:
\[ \$400 - \$2 = \$398 \]

So, Clara paid $398.

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30:
\[ 20 \text{ pomegranates} \times \$30 \text{ per pomegranate} = \$600 \]

Sheila got a 10% discount on the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times \$600 = \$60 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price} = \$600 - \$60 = \$540 \]

So, Sheila paid $540.

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
\[ \$540 - \$398 = \$142 \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the earnings from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne earned $400 from red hats.
   - This amount is half of what she earned from green hats.
   - Therefore, the earnings from green hats in the first month = $400 * 2 = $800.

2. **Calculate the total earnings in the first month:**
   - Total earnings in the first month = Earnings from red hats + Earnings from green hats
   - Total earnings in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200.

3. **Calculate the earnings in the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.
   - Therefore, earnings in the second month = 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

4. **Calculate the total earnings over the two months:**
   - Total earnings over two months = Earnings in the first month + Earnings in the second month
   - Total earnings over two months = $1200 + $900 = $2100.

**Final numerical answer:**
$2100"
"First, let's figure out how many hours James is actually paying for. He hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. Since he gets 1 hour free, he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first hour costs $15.
- Each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour, so each additional hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- The first hour costs $15.
- The next two hours (since he pays for 3 hours total) each cost $30.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 15 + 30 + 30 = 75 \]

Therefore, the total amount James paid is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - It took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - To find the total cooking time, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans.
   - Total cooking time = \(30 + 50 + 40 = 120\) minutes.

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts).

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ pound} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$5 \]

The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \text{ pound} \times \$15/\text{pound} = \$5 \]

So, the total cost of the first mixture is:
\[ \$5 + \$5 = \$10 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts).

The cost of 1/5 pound almonds:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \text{ pound} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$2 \]

The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \text{ pound} \times \$15/\text{pound} = \$5 \]

So, the total cost of the second mixture is:
\[ \$2 + \$5 = \$7 \]

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
\[ \$10 - \$7 = \$3 \]

Therefore, the first mixture costs \$3 more than the second mixture."
"To solve this problem, let's use the information given:

1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.
3. The total number of animal legs is 70.
4. The total number of animal heads is 20.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

To find 20% of $5:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 5 = 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Therefore, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for the week.

The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2.

So, the total cost for the coffee and the donut is:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"

"First, let's find out how many teachers are history teachers. We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers.

To find 60% of 150, we calculate:
\[ 60\% \times 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers.

Next, we need to find out how many teachers are math teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:
\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers.

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
\[ 60 \text{ teachers} \times 6 \text{ hours/teacher} = 360 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we determine how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the amounts of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have together:

\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out how much each person would have if they shared the total money equally, we divide the total by 3:

"Let's break down the information given:

- Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records.
- She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral.
- Her first 8 days were good.
- Her next 8 days were bad.
- Her following 8 days were neutral.
- The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

First, let's confirm the number of neutral days:
- Total days = 30
- Good days = 12
- Bad days = 8
- Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days)
- Neutral days = 30 - (12 + 8) = 30 - 20 = 10

Now, let's account for the last 3 days:
- The last 3 days were good, neutral, and good.
- This adds 2 more good days to the total.

So, the updated count of good days is:
- Initial good days = 12
- Additional good days from the last 3 days = 2
- Total good days = 12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 14."
"To find out how many books Sally has, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's say Sally has \( x \) books. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Janey's books} = 2x + 3 \]

We know that Janey has 21 books, so we can substitute 21 for Janey's books in the equation:
\[ 21 = 2x + 3 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( x \). First, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2x \]
\[ 18 = 2x \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

"First, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can calculate the current height in inches as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. We subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, the bamboo will be 600 inches tall in \(\boxed{12}\) days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has enough toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for 24 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has enough toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - Initially, James needed 8 toys.
   - After the second purchase, he needed 12 more toys.
   - The total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

So, the total number of toys James needs is **20**."

We can set up the proportion as follows:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}} \]

To find \( x \), we can cross-multiply and solve for \( x \):

\[ 6x = 36 \times 96 \]

\[ 6x = 3456 \]

\[ x = \frac{3456}{6} \]

\[ x = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack.

Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. So, the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Including Jack, the total number of people is 9. Since Jack is also an adult, his weight is also 80 kg. So, the total weight of Jack and the 8 adults is:
\[ 640 + 80 = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they have exceeded the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 - 700 = 20 \text{ kg} \]

So, they have exceeded the maximum load by:
\[ \boxed{20} \text{ kg} \]"
"First, let's find out how many cookies Max has. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + 5 \]
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 68 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 73 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + 12 \]
\[ 73 = \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + 12 \]
\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = 73 - 12 \]
\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = 61 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cookies Summer has. Since Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 \]
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = 73 + 23 \]
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = 96 \]

\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 298 \]

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds 20 cm of lace trim to make the final dress 140 cm long. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

First, combine the terms involving \( x \):

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, isolate \( 1.5x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

**Final Answer:**

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the mowing rates for both modes.

1. **Turtle Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - Therefore, the rate for turtle mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, the rate for rabbit mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, Chris mowed half the lawn in turtle mode and the other half in rabbit mode.

3. **Time to Mow Half the Lawn in Turtle Mode:**
   - Since the rate for turtle mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \), the time to mow half the lawn is:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Time to Mow Half the Lawn in Rabbit Mode:**
   - Since the rate for rabbit mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \), the time to mow half the lawn is:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of that twin is \( T + 7 \).

The other two triplets will be the same age as the first triplet, so their ages are also \( T \).

The other twin will be the same age as the twin who is 7 years older, so the age of the other twin is also \( T + 7 \).

Now, we can write the equation for their combined ages:
\[ T + T + (T + 7) + (T + 7) = 44 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 4T + 14 = 44 \]

Next, solve for \( T \):
\[ 4T = 44 - 14 \]
\[ 4T = 30 \]
\[ T = \frac{30}{4} \]
\[ T = 7.5 \]

So, the age of one of the triplets is 7.5 years. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older, is:
\[ T + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{14.5}\)."
"First, let's convert the 3 hours before dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's find out the cost of the candies. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20. So, the cost of 1 candy is:

\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

This means each candy costs $0.80.

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 10 candies. Since each candy costs $0.80, the cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:

\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong saves 20 coins each month, so over 120 months, he saves:

\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves 28 coins each month, so over 120 months, he saves:

\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding the savings of Rong and Neil together, we get:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

So, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the cost of the heartworm check be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. If we let the total bill be \( T \), then:
\[ x = 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + x \]

Substituting \( x = 0.60 \times T \) into the equation for \( T \):
\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To solve for \( T \), we rearrange the equation:
\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. Therefore, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each type of fruit per piece:

- The cost of one apple is $0.5.
- The cost of one banana is twice the cost of an apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
- The cost of one orange is three times the cost of a banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:

- For bananas: \(5 \text{ bananas} \times \$1.0 \text{ per banana} = \$5.0\).
- For apples: \(12 \text{ apples} \times \$0.5 \text{ per apple} = \$6.0\).
- For oranges: \(7 \text{ oranges} \times \$3.0 \text{ per orange} = \$21.0\).

Finally, we add up the costs to find the total price for the crate:

\[
\$5.0 + \$6.0 + \$21.0 = \$32.0
\]

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\$32.0\)."
"First, let's find out how many squares of each color Brittany's comforter has.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 4 more than red squares, so \(14 + 4 = 18\)
3. Green squares: 6 more than blue squares, so \(18 + 6 = 24\)
4. White squares: 12 fewer than green squares, so \(24 - 12 = 12\)

Now, let's add up all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is the same as the total number of squares. Therefore, the total area of Brittany's comforter is:
\[68 \text{ square feet}\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[68\]"
"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. We know the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs.

\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant.

\[ \text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of chairs required is:

\[ \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed.

\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

So, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"First, let's find out how many bucks there are. Since 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks:

   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Betty's Points (Recheck):**
   We already calculated Betty's points as 65, so this is correct.

5. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, let's sum up all the points collected by the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into her retirement account.

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her paycheck for this.

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she put into her retirement account and her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend.

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is:

16 ÷ 2 = 8 pairs

So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:

- The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- So, the total number of fireworks from the city is \(15 \times 20 = 300\).

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will see from the city:

- Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks.
- So, the number of fireworks Hannah will see from the city is \(300 \times 0.40 = 120\).

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:

- Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- So, the total number of fireworks from Hannah's backyard is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Finally, let's add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city and the fireworks she sets off in her backyard to find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is **135**."
"First, let's determine the total number of people going to the cinema. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys drinks and snacks for the seat. Each seat requires 2 drinks and 3 snacks. Since there are 20 seats, the total number of drinks needed is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

And the total number of snacks needed is:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Each drink and each snack costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

And the total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money spent on drinks and snacks:

\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \]

So, the group has spent a total of:

\[ \boxed{200} \] dollars on snacks and drinks."
"First, let's find out how much Gordy's truck can haul. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we add 800 pounds to 4,000 pounds:

\[ 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds.

Next, we know that when Gary's truck joins Gissela's and Gordy's, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds. We already know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we add the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks and subtract this total from 11,600 pounds:

\[ 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we subtract this from the total capacity of the three trucks:

\[ 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

Final answer:
\[ 2,800 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

Their goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. From the information given, in the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. So, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. 

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

"First, let's find out what percentage of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes by the city.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, we calculate 80% of 40%:

\[ 0.80 \times 40\% = 0.80 \times 0.40 = 0.32 \]

This means 32% of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes by the city.

To find out what percentage of the river's total water is used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage from the total usage by the city:

\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy eat in two weeks.

Two weeks have 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's find out how much candy each of them has left after 14 days.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has:
\[ 100 - 56 = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has:
\[ 100 - 42 = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:

- Left foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)

Finally, we sum up the taps for both feet:
- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150\)

The combined total number of taps is:
\[1300 + 1150 = 2450\]

So, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:
\[
\boxed{2450}

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of having the city fix it and the total cost of Ron fixing it himself, then find the difference.

1. **Cost if the city fixes the pothole:**
   - The pothole will do $450 worth of damage to Ron's car if it's not fixed.
   - Therefore, the cost if the city fixes it is $0 (since the pothole won't cause damage).

2. **Cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself:**
   - Ron will be fined $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.
   - Ron will also need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.
   - The total cost for the asphalt is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole is \(120 + 75 = 195\) dollars.

3. **Savings by fixing the pothole:**
   - The savings is the difference between the cost of having the city fix it and the cost of Ron fixing it himself.
   - Since the city fixing it costs $0, the savings is \(0 - 195 = -195\) dollars.

However, the question asks how much money Ron saves, which implies a positive value. Since Ron incurs a cost of $195 by fixing it himself, he actually spends $195 more than if the city fixed it. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that Ron does not save any money but instead spends $195 more.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{195}

"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of normal chairs left after some were sent for repair.
2. Calculate the number of baby chairs left after some were sent for repair.
3. Add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs together.

Let's start with the normal chairs:
- Initially, there are 170 normal chairs.
- 20 normal chairs were sent for repair.
- So, the number of normal chairs left is \(170 - 20 = 150\).

Next, let's calculate the baby chairs:
- Initially, there are 23 baby chairs.
- 13 baby chairs were sent for repair.
- So, the number of baby chairs left is \(23 - 13 = 10\).

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs together:
- The total number of chairs left is \(150 + 10 = 160\).

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{160}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 5 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and his two friends ate. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]

Since three people ate 8 slices each, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate how many slices the other two friends ate. Each of these two people ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Since two people ate 9 slices each, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages.

The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages. The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the cat's time, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Dog's time} = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we have:
- The cat takes 30 minutes.
- The dog takes 20 minutes.

To find the average time, we add the two times together and divide by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"First, let's convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the 4 inches gives:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be written as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"To find out how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows she smashes for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars, and then add those numbers together.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter (1/4) of the students' cars' windows.

Number of students' cars' windows smashed:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 64 \times 4 = 16 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters (3/4) of the teachers' cars' windows.

Number of teachers' cars' windows smashed:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 32 \times 2 = 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Now, we add the number of windows smashed for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

So, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"First, let's find the total number of spools Candy has:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we need to find the total number of blue spools:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total number of blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.4 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 40\% \]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000

2. **People who voted by midday (12:00)**:
   - By midday, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by midday = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \)

3. **Remaining people after midday**:
   - Remaining people = Initial number - Number of people who voted by midday
   - Remaining people = 5000 - 2000 = 3000

4. **People who voted by 16:00**:
   - By 16:00, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00 = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \)

5. **Remaining people who had not voted by 16:00**:
   - Remaining people = Remaining people after midday - Number of people who voted by 16:00
   - Remaining people = 3000 - 2000 = 1000

**Final answer**: 1000"
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are needed based on the number of pieces per pack.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum are required. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need \(\boxed{8}\) packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed.

- Each of the 9 kids wants 2 smores: \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- Each of the 6 adults wants 1 smore: \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.

So, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

Next, we need to determine how many graham cracker sleeves are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes 8 smores:

- The number of sleeves needed is \(\frac{24}{8} = 3\) sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"First, let's find out Dora's father's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

Father's age = 2 × Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 × 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age. Since Dora's mother is four years younger than her father:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."

- Math book: 2 pounds
- Science book: 2 pounds
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: twice the weight of the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds

Now, let's add up the weights of all the books:

\[
2 \text{ (Math)} + 2 \text{ (Science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (History)} = 17 \text{ pounds}

"First, let's find out how many votes candidate A got. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we need to calculate how many votes candidate B got. Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. So, we first find 50% of candidate A's votes:

\[ 50\% \text{ of candidate A's votes} = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]

Then, we add this to candidate A's votes to find candidate B's votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we know the total number of votes is 100. We can find the number of votes candidate C got by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

So, candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's apples as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's apples} = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each has after this transaction.

Boris's new number of apples:
\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

Beck's new number of apples:
\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of ice cube.

1. **Giant Cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) ounces.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 1/2 ounce of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \( 8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4 \) ounces.

Next, we add up the total water used for all the cubes:
\[ 12 \text{ ounces (giant cubes)} + 14 \text{ ounces (medium cubes)} + 4 \text{ ounces (small cubes)} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the final answer is:

"First, let's find out how many books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Clara's books} = 2 \times \text{Steven's books} \]

Given Clara's books = 20, we can solve for Steven's books:

\[ 20 = 2 \times \text{Steven's books} \]
\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, we know Steven has 10 books. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

**Final Answer: 4**"
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars} \]

2. **Students who like to bake**: 10
3. **Students who like to play basketball**: 5
4. **Students who like to play music**: This is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. So, \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now, let's calculate the number of students who like to play video games.

First, we find the total number of students who have hobbies other than baking or playing basketball:
\[ 10 \text{ (baking)} + 5 \text{ (basketball)} = 15 \]

Next, we subtract the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students to find the number who like to play video games:

"First, let's find out how many students are in each class. Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same amount of students, we divide 80 by 2:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

So, each class has 40 students.

Next, we need to find out how many of these students are girls. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find 40% of 40, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \times 40 = 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \]

So, there are 16 girls in each class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is 24."

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark spent on the packs of magic cards. He bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards he received. He got 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the value of these two cards is:
\[ 4000 + 1000 = 5000 \]

There are 30 more cards, each worth an average of $50. So, the total value of these 30 cards is:
\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Adding the value of all the cards together, we get:
\[ 5000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily savings.**

- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each.
- Now, he buys them for $0.40 each.
- The savings per tomato is $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10.
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- Therefore, the daily savings is $0.10 * 500 = $50.

**Step 2: Calculate the weekly savings.**

- There are 7 days in a week.
- The weekly savings is $50 * 7 = $350.

So, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can say:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

So, if Sean has 56 marbles:

\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

To find Cal's marbles, we multiply both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Carl has. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Now, to find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together:

"First, let's determine how many students will be in each of the six groups when fifty-four students are divided equally among them.

\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for 12 groups, assuming each group still has 9 students.

\[ \text{Total students for 12 groups} = 12 \times 9 = 108 \]

Since we only have 54 students, we need to find out how many more groups can be formed with the 54 students. We already have 6 groups, so we need to find out how many more groups of 9 students can be formed from the remaining students.

First, let's see how many more students are needed to form 12 groups:

\[ \text{Students needed for 12 groups} = 108 - 54 = 54 \]

Since we already have 54 students and we need 54 more to form 12 groups, we can form:

\[ \text{Additional groups} = \frac{54}{9} = 6 \]

However, since we already have 6 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed beyond the 6 we already have to reach 12 groups.

\[ \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Calculate the number of chairs rented during a weekday:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
   - So, in one week, the number of chairs rented on weekdays is \(5 \times 60 = 300\) chairs.

2. **Calculate the number of chairs rented during a weekend:**
   - There are 2 days in a weekend.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
   - So, in one week, the number of chairs rented on weekends is \(2 \times 100 = 200\) chairs.

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented in one week:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one week is the sum of the chairs rented on weekdays and weekends.
   - So, in one week, the total number of chairs rented is \(300 + 200 = 500\) chairs.

4. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:**
   - There are 8 weeks in two 4-week months.
   - So, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is \(8 \times 500 = 4000\) chairs.

"First, let's find out how much each roommate pays per month for electricity. Since the total monthly electricity bill is $100 and there are 5 people (Jenna and her 4 roommates) sharing it equally, we divide $100 by 5.

\[ \text{Monthly cost per person} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Next, to find out how much each person pays per year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

\[ \text{Annual cost per person} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \]

So, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity."
"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. Since one dozen equals 12, we can calculate the total number of glasses and plates as follows:

- Total glasses: \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \)
- Total plates: \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \)

Next, we need to account for the items that were broken. According to the problem, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken.

- Remaining glasses: \( 96 - 10 = 86 \)
- Remaining plates: \( 48 - 6 = 42 \)

Now, we add the remaining glasses and plates together to find the total number of items Jeff has now:

- Total remaining items: \( 86 + 42 = 128 \)

So, Jeff has 128 glasses and plates now.

**Final Answer:**
128"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be traded for a large button, so 27 small buttons = 27 large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(40 + 27 = 67\) large buttons and \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(67 + 20 = 87\) large buttons and 3 small stickers.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 20 large stickers left (40 - 20).
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(87 - 20 = 67\) large buttons and \(3 + 60 = 63\) small buttons.

5. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 67 large buttons and 63 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth three small stickers, but since we are counting buttons, we count them as they are.
   - Total buttons = 67 large buttons + 63 small buttons = 130 buttons.

**Final Answer:**
130"
"Let's break it down step by step:

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which means he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, let's add up all the matches Joey played in the week:

- Matches on Monday: 2
- Matches on Friday: 1
- Matches on Saturday: 4

Total matches played in one week = \(2 + 1 + 4 = 7\)

So, Joey played 7 matches in one week."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of small shirts = \(2 \times 11 = 22\).

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = \(22 - 4 = 18\).

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up all the shirts:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75

"To find out how much you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 bag, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of the discount.
2. Subtract the discount from the original price.

**Step 1: Calculate the discount amount.**

The discount is 5% of $140. To find 5% of $140, multiply $140 by 0.05 (since 5% is the same as 5/100 or 0.05).

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \]

**Step 2: Subtract the discount from the original price.**

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price of $140.

\[ \text{Final price} = 140 - 7 = 133 \]

So, after the discount, you will pay \(\boxed{133}\)."
"First, let's find out how many songs John has in total from his 20 playlists.

Each playlist has 300 songs, and John has 20 playlists, so the total number of songs is:
\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we know that each song is 10 hours long. Therefore, the total time for all the songs is:
\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is:
\[ 60000 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people is calculated as:
\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 60\% \times 40 = \frac{60}{100} \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:
\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race.

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls.
2. If 6 Pomeranian girls represent one third of the Pomeranians, then the total number of Pomeranians is:
   \[
   6 \times 3 = 18
   \]
3. We also know that the Pomeranians make up two thirds of all Jana's puppies. If 18 Pomeranians are two thirds of the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times \text{total puppies} = 18
   \]
4. To find the total number of puppies, we solve for the total puppies:
   \[
   \text{total puppies} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
   \]

So, Jana has \(\boxed{27}\) puppies."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ava gave to Jayden. Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, Ava gave Jayden $45.

Next, we add the money Jayden originally had to the money Ava gave him:

\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, which costs $200. We subtract the total amount of money Jayden has from the cost of the camera:

\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2} \) of what the first house needs, so it will need \( \frac{x}{2} \) cases.
- The third house will need double what the first house needs, so it will need \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{4x}{2} = \frac{7x}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7x}{2} = 250 \]

To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7x = 500 \]

Then divide both sides by 7:
\[ x = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles. Since we are asked for the final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{143} \]"

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of the number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of pears and bananas together:

Total number of fruits = Number of pears + Number of bananas
Total number of fruits = 290 + 200
Total number of fruits = 490

So, George has 490 fruits in total."

"To find out how far the Llesis family's vacation spot is, we need to calculate the distance they covered by driving and the distance they covered by hiking, then add these distances together.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance covered by driving
- They drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
- Their average driving speed was 50 miles per hour.

The distance covered by driving is:
\[ \text{Distance by driving} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 225 \, \text{miles} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance covered by hiking
- They hiked for 1.5 hours.
- Their hiking speed was \( \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.

The distance covered by hiking is:
\[ \text{Distance by hiking} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance
The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance covered by driving and the distance covered by hiking:

"Let's break down the points for both Ava and Emma based on the given information.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- Ava jumps on \( E_e + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( E_b + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level \( E_t + 4 \) seconds later.

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \) (number of enemies)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \) (number of berries)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \) (time left on the timer)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]

Now, let's expand Ava's score:
\[ \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

"First, let's find out how much the two remaining pizzas cost in total. The total cost for all four pizzas is $64, and two of the pizzas cost $30. So, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost:

\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

This means the remaining two pizzas cost $34 in total. Since these two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide $34 by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:

\[ 34 \div 2 = 17 \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 17 \]"
"To find out how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of rides on the usual days:**
   - They ride 3 times a day for 5 days.
   - So, the total number of rides on these 5 days is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

2. **Calculate the number of rides on the two special days:**
   - On these two days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) rides per day.
   - So, the total number of rides on these 2 days is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

3. **Add the rides from the usual days and the special days:**
   - The total number of rides in a week is \(15 + 12 = 27\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
27

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, bringing the total number of fish to \(7 + 17 = 24\).
3. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish became \(3 + x\) and the number of white fish became \(4 + y\), where \(x\) is the number of orange fish he bought and \(y\) is the number of white fish he bought.
4. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   3 + x = 2(4 + y)
   \]
5. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   3 + x = 8 + 2y
   \]
   \[
   x - 2y = 5
   \]
6. We also know that the total number of fish bought is 17, so:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]
7. Now we have a system of linear equations:
   \[
   \begin{cases}
   x - 2y = 5 \\
   x + y = 17
   \end{cases}
   \]
8. We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express \(x\) in terms of \(y\):
   \[
   x = 17 - y
   \]
9. Substitute \(x = 17 - y\) into the first equation:
   \[
   17 - y - 2y = 5
   \]
   \[
   17 - 3y = 5
   \]
   \[
   -3y = 5 - 17
   \]
   \[
   -3y = -12
   \]
   \[
   y = 4
   \]
10. Now substitute \(y = 4\) back into the equation \(x + y = 17\):
    \[
    x + 4 = 17
    \]
    \[
    x = 13
    \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

She also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much she spent. She spent \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount spent on quarters is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount spent is:
\[ 120 + 35 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

So, the total number of tomatoes is:
\[ 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} \times 5 \text{ plants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

So, the total number of eggplants is:
\[ 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
\[ 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 142 \]"

   - Number of analog TVs = \(\frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5\).

3. **OLED TVs:**
   - The rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40.
   - TVs sold as smart TVs + TVs sold as analog TVs = 10 + 5 = 15.
   - Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold = 40 - 15 = 25.

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is **25**."
"First, let's determine the total amount of money needed for the trip. The trip costs $300.

"First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at different points in time:

1. **Billy's starting hourly wage:** $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months:** Billy's wage increases by $0.50 per hour, so his new wage is:
   \[
   10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]
3. **On his first anniversary:** Billy's wage increases by another $1.00 per hour, so his new wage is:
   \[
   10.50 + 1.00 = 11.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

Since the problem does not specify which wage to use for the calculation (Billy's current wage or his first anniversary wage), we will use his first anniversary wage for the calculation, as it is the most recent and likely the wage he is currently earning.

Next, let's determine Sally's starting hourly wage:
- Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so:
  \[
  10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the earnings for both Billy and Sally for 20 hours of work:

- **Billy's earnings:**
  \[
  11.50 \text{ dollars per hour} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 230 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- **Sally's earnings:**
  \[
  10.50 \text{ dollars per hour} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 210 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:

"First, let's find out how many stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's say Bubbles buys \( x \) stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals will then be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate how many hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, then in 14 days, she plays:

\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate how many hours Kris plays in the following week. If she plays for 2 hours every day for 7 days, then:

\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played so far:

\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours:

1. Total candies after the additional order: \(100 + 100 = 200\)
2. Number of candies sold: 150

Now, subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies:

\[200 - 150 = 50\]

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies.

**Final Answer: 50**"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the beginning of the year.

1. **Beginning of the year (January):**
   - Number of students = 10

2. **End of January:**
   - Number of students doubles = \(10 \times 2 = 20\)

3. **End of February:**
   - Number of students doubles = \(20 \times 2 = 40\)

4. **End of March:**
   - Number of students doubles = \(40 \times 2 = 80\)

5. **End of April:**
   - Number of students doubles = \(80 \times 2 = 160\)

6. **End of May:**
   - Number of students doubles = \(160 \times 2 = 320\)

Now, we need to find the additional number of students that joined by the end of May, compared to the beginning of the year.

- Number of students at the end of May = 320
- Number of students at the beginning of the year = 10

The additional number of students is:
\[ 320 - 10 = 310 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{310} \]"
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find out the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

1. **3 flowers with 5 petals each:**
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
   \]

2. **4 flowers with 6 petals each:**
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **5 flowers with 4 petals each:**
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
   \]

4. **6 flowers with 7 petals each:**
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
   \]

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}
\]

Subtract the petals dropped from the total number of petals:
\[
101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals}
\]

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[
\boxed{79}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many marshmallows were used to make the S'mores. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they used:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we need to account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so we subtract these from the total number of marshmallows initially in the bag:

\[ 35 - 3 = 32 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we subtract the marshmallows used to make the S'mores from the remaining marshmallows:

\[ 32 - 18 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

These 14 marshmallows are the ones left to make more S'mores. Since John and DeSean are sharing these equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

\[ 14 \div 2 = 7 \text{ marshmallows per person} \]

So, each kid can have 7 more S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's break down the time each person can play with one quarter:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes.
2. Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The other friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.

Next, we need to calculate how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (which is 240 minutes):

1. Jack: \(\frac{240}{20} = 12\) quarters
2. Each of the two friends who can play for 10 minutes: \(\frac{240}{10} = 24\) quarters each
3. The friend who can play for 30 minutes: \(\frac{240}{30} = 8\) quarters

Now, we add up all the quarters used:

- Jack: 12 quarters
- First friend: 24 quarters
- Second friend: 24 quarters
- Better friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: \(12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68\)

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"Let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of all the ingredients, and it fills a 10-ounce jar. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
We can divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. To do this, we need to express \( z \) in terms of \( s \) or vice versa. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can solve for \( z \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive amounts and must be such that the total is 10 ounces, we can test possible values. However, we can also solve for \( s \) directly by recognizing that \( z \) must be a positive value. Let's solve for \( s \) in terms of a possible integer value that fits the equation.

If we assume \( s = 1 \):
\[ z = 5 - 2(1) = 3 \]
This gives us:
\[ z = 3, \quad s = 1, \quad 2s = 2 \]
Checking the total:
\[ 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 \]
This fits the total of 10 ounces. Therefore, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- So, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- So, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4500}

"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. 

First, let's find out how many cupcakes Paul already has:
\[ 8 \text{ (chocolate)} + 40 \text{ (toffee)} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy:
\[ 63 \text{ (total needed)} - 48 \text{ (already has)} = 15 \text{ cupcakes} \]

So, Paul should buy \(\boxed{15}\) more cupcakes."
"First, let's find out how many cars Joe has initially.

Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars that is:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 40 = \frac{20}{100} \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, let's calculate how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away:
\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe remains with:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to find out how much money came from the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they raised a total of $125,000. So, the amount each student raised is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Therefore, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"First, let's find out how many hours Sandy walked on the second day. Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day, and she walked for 8 hours on the first day, we can calculate the hours for the second day as follows:

\[ \text{Hours on the second day} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the hours from both days to find the total time Sandy walked:

\[ \text{Total hours} = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since we need the final answer in minutes, we convert the total hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ \text{Total minutes} = 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:

\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars entered the parking lot. So, the total number of cars became:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
3. When Hunter got out for the lunch break, half of the cars had left. So, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]
4. Therefore, the number of cars left in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35
   \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.**

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the total number of tasks per day is:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.**

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of tasks per week is:
\[ 150 \text{ tasks/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1050 \text{ tasks/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for the week.**

Each task pays $1.20, so the total earnings for the week are:
\[ 1050 \text{ tasks/week} \times 1.20 \text{ dollars/task} = 1260 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Game:**
   - Sasha scored 14 points.
   - Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha.
     \[
     \text{Julie's score} = 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ points}
     \]

2. **Second Game:**
   - The second game was at Julie's home court.
   - Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game.
     \[
     \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Total Points Sasha Scored:**
   - Add Sasha's scores from both games.

     \]

So, the total points Sasha scored during both games is **18**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought:

- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.

So, the total number of tins of cat food is:
\[ 8 \text{ packages} \times 11 \text{ tins/package} = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought:

- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.

So, the total number of tins of dog food is:
\[ 6 \text{ packages} \times 6 \text{ tins/package} = 36 \text{ tins} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 \text{ tins} - 36 \text{ tins} = 52 \text{ tins} \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:

Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.

Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

So, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"First, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount.

\[ \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \]

Next, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound for the weight of the book and $0.08 per mile for the distance to the distribution center.

The weight of the book is 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is:

\[ \text{Weight cost} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \]

The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, so the cost for the distance is:

\[ \text{Distance cost} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \]

Adding these two costs together gives the total shipping cost:

\[ \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose by subtracting the refund from the total shipping cost:

\[ \text{Money lost} = 3.00 - 24 = -21 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Milly will actually lose $21. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan has after her father gave her some money:

Mulan initially has $40, and her father gave her $100, so:
\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she spends on the jeans and the bag. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the cost for the jeans is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

She also buys a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is:
\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount of money she had:
\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

So, the final amount of money Mulan has left is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, let's first calculate the production for each of the first three weeks and then determine the remaining production for the fourth week.

1. **First Week:**
   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

2. **Second Week:**
   Boris produces half as much as the first week. So, the production is:
   \[
   \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week:**
   Boris produces three times as much as the first week. So, the production is:
   \[
   3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   Adding the production of the first three weeks:
   \[
   8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Total Monthly Production:**
   Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

6. **Fourth Week Production:**
   To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the monthly production:
   \[
   50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}

- Cost for 1 additional chandelier: \(1 \times 15 = 15\) dollars
- Cost for 10 additional pictures: \(10 \times 15 = 150\) dollars

Adding these to the base cost:

\[129 + 30 + 15 + 150 = 324\]

So, the total cost for Angela will be **$324.00**."
"First, let's find out how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + \$10.00 = \$20.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times \$30.00 = \$12.00 \]

So, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 = 480 \) inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, \( 480 \) inches is \( \frac{480}{12} = 40 \) feet.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the time it would take for one kangaroo to do the same by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.
   - Time for one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 = 6 hours.

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - The problem states that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.
   - Therefore, if one kangaroo takes 6 hours to travel the distance, a turtle, traveling at half the speed, would take twice as long.
   - Time for one turtle = 6 hours * 2 = 12 hours.

3. **Determine the time for four turtles:**
   - Since the turtles are traveling at the same speed and the distance is the same, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is the same as the time it takes for one turtle.
   - Therefore, the time for four turtles = 12 hours.

**Final Answer:**
12 hours"
"First, let's find out how many clay dishes each person made.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The original price of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200. So, the new price of the laptop is:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop after receiving some money from her job and her mom. This means the total amount of money she currently has is:
   \[
   400 - 50 = 350 \text{ dollars}

From the 3 large apples, since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

From the 5 small apples, since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of slices:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices eaten} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the final number of apple slices left is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much milk the farmer currently gets from his 3 cows.

Each cow gives 5 liters of milk a day, so 3 cows give:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk he needs, we subtract the current production from the desired production:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many more cows are needed to produce the additional 10 liters:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total length of the glue that is not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these amounts.

1. **First glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \(1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}\)
   - Unused portion: \(\frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}\)

2. **Second glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \(1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\)
   - Unused portion: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}\)

3. **Third glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \(1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\)
   - Unused portion: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ millimeters}\)

Now, we add the unused portions together:
\[2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[16 \text{ millimeters}\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

- Cost of the car: $10000
- Cost of the phone: $800

Total cost = $10000 + $800 = $10800

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has:

- Money from working: $5000
- Money from his brother: $200

Total money Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, let's find out how much more money Gabriel needs:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Gabriel has
Money needed = $10800 - $5200 = $5600

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"To find out how much change Thea received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman.
2. Subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount given.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman. She gave four $20 bills, so we multiply 4 by $20:

\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount given. The hat cost $70, so we subtract $70 from $80:

\[ 80 - 70 = 10 \]

Therefore, the change Thea received is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"First, let's calculate how much money Craig starts with. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he starts with:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount of money Craig started with to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of socks Jack has:**
   - Jack collected 60 dishes.
   - Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks.
   - Let the number of socks Jack has be \( S \).
   - According to the problem, \( 60 = 2S \).
   - Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \).
   - So, Jack has 30 socks.

2. **Determine the number of socks Peter has:**
   - Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.
   - Since Jack has 30 socks, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.

3. **Determine the number of dishes Peter has:**
   - Peter has half as many dishes as Jack.
   - Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

4. **Calculate the total number of socks and dishes:**
   - Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes.
   - Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes.
   - The total number of socks is \( 30 + 60 = 90 \).
   - The total number of dishes is \( 60 + 30 = 90 \).
   - Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- There are 5 students who are good at math only.
- There are 8 students who perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, let's find out how many students are not good at both subjects:
- Total students = 20
- Students good at math only + Students good at English only = 5 + 8 = 13

So, the number of students good at both subjects is:
- Total students - Students good at math only - Students good at English only = 20 - 13 = 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math (including those who are good at both):
- Students good at math only + Students good at both math and English = 5 + 7 = 12

Therefore, the total number of students good at math is 12.

"First, let's calculate the total time each group needs to perform, including the time to get on stage and exit the stage. Each group needs:

- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for each group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert is 2 hours long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

There is also a 10-minute intermission. So, the total time available for the groups to perform is:
\[ 120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many groups can perform in the 110 minutes available. Since each group needs 10 minutes, the number of groups is:
\[ \frac{110}{10} = 11 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand how simple interest works. Simple interest is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

In this case, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, let's find the annual interest rate. The problem states that the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. So, the rate is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \]

However, the rate should be in decimal form for the formula. So, we convert 225% to a decimal:

\[ \text{Rate} = 225\% = 2.25 \]

Now, we can calculate the simple interest for one year:

\[ \text{Simple Interest per year} = 300 \times 2.25 = 675 \]

Since the interest is simple, it does not compound. Therefore, the interest earned each year is $675. Over 3 years, the total interest earned is:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 675 \times 3 = 2025 \]

Finally, to find the total amount after 3 years, we add the total interest to the original principal:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 = 2325 \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

\[ \boxed{2325} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total white shirts: 40
- Total floral shirts: 50
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

- Out of the 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:

- Number of floral shirts without buttons: 30
- Number of white shirts without collars: 20

The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

Final numerical answer:
10"
"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer will use. Since each tray holds 30 eggs and the farmer has 900 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

So, the farmer will earn \(\$75\)."
"First, let's calculate how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's find out how many goats are left in each farm after the sales.

For Farm X:
- Initially, there were 55 goats.
- After selling 10 goats, the number of goats left is \(55 - 10 = 45\).

For Farm Y:
- Initially, there were 45 goats.
- After selling 20 goats, the number of goats left is \(45 - 20 = 25\).

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y together:
\[45 + 25 = 70\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
70"
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year:**
   - James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year}
     \]

2. **Calculate the average cost per pair of shoes:**
   - James spends $2640 on shoes each year.
   - To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:
     \[
     \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair}
     \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the cost of the green food baskets:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- So, the total cost for green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food baskets:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are getting $2 off for each basket of red food.
- So, the cost of each basket of red food after the discount is \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- So, the total cost for red food is \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

Now, let's add the total cost of the green food and the red food:
- Total cost for green food: $75
- Total cost for red food: $48
- So, the total amount you have to pay is \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

"First, let's find out how many rooms are in one-half of the motel.

Total rooms = 90
One-half of the rooms = 90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Now, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. So, for 45 rooms:

Time to clean 45 rooms = 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

900 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 15 hours

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

15 hours"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Year:**
   - The town will build 12 homes.

2. **Second Year:**
   - They will build three times the number of homes built in the first year.
   - Number of homes in the second year = \(3 \times 12 = 36\).

3. **Third Year:**
   - They will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and then double that number.
   - Total homes built in the first two years = \(12 + 36 = 48\).
   - Number of homes in the third year = \(2 \times 48 = 96\).

4. **Total Homes Built Over Three Years:**
   - Sum of homes built in all three years = \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\).

So, the town will have built a total of 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of your brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of your sister.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( S = Y - 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + S + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, substitute \( Y \) and \( S \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation:
\[ (B - 3) + (B - 3 - 2) + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
Simplify the equation:
\[ B - 3 + B - 5 + B + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]
Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]
Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find your age \( Y \):
\[ Y = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"First, we need to find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

So, Mr. Jackson needs 54 glue sticks in total.

Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks he needs to buy. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide 54 by 8 to find out how many full packs he needs:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs to ensure he has enough glue sticks.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the changes in the amount of water passing through the river step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After Heavy Rain:**
   After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. So, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Increase on the Third Day:**
   On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year (12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together, they have 85 books: \( S + A + F = 85 \).
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne: \( S = A + 25 \).
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn: \( A = F - 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. From the third piece of information, we know \( A = F - 12 \). Substituting this into the second piece of information, we get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \).

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85, \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85. \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84. \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28. \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"First, let's figure out how many jello cups Greg needs in total. If there are 30 kids and each kid can have 4 jello cups, then:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 3-ounce boxes of jello Greg will need to make 120 cups. Since 1 box makes 10 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per box:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Each box costs $1.25, so:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

So, Greg will spend \(\$15.00\) on jello."

So, Tobias has eaten a total of 48 pieces of pizza so far."
"First, let's find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00. So, the cost of one bottle of soda is:
\[ \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]
So, one bottle of soda costs $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00. So, the cost of one bottle of water is:
\[ \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]
So, one bottle of water costs $2.00.

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. The cost for 3 bottles of soda is:
\[ 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]
The cost for 2 bottles of water is:
\[ 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{13.00} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03.

Total cost = Number of bolts × Cost per bolt
Total cost = 16 × $0.03
Total cost = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has to find out how much he has left.

Money left = David's money - Total cost
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

So, after paying for the bolts, David has $12.00 left."
"First, we need to find out how much Ella earns per hour. She earned $33 for 3 hours, so we divide $33 by 3 to find her hourly rate.

\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much she would earn after 12 hours. We do this by multiplying her hourly rate by 12.

\[ \text{Earnings after 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

So, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Paul has after his friend gave him 28 marbles.

Paul originally had 52 marbles. After receiving 28 more, he has:
\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \text{ marbles} \]

Next, Paul lost \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \text{ marbles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total he had:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \text{ marbles} \]

So, the final number of marbles Paul has left is:
\[ 60 \]"

"First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. The total selling price of the chickens is:

\[ \text{Total selling price} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

This total selling price of $9000 includes the cost of the chickens plus the $2000 profit. Therefore, the cost of the chickens he took to the market is:

\[ \text{Cost of chickens} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for \(\boxed{7000}\) dollars."
"First, let's find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold together. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sold was 32, we subtract Julie's sales from the total:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

This means Micah and Mitchell together sold 18 glasses. Since they sold an equal number of glasses, we divide this number by 2 to find out how many each sold:

\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

**Final Answer: 5**"
"First, let's find out how much Iris spent on the manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, we calculate:

\[ \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure, so:

\[ \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent at the spa:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hair cost} + \text{Manicure cost} + \text{Pedicure cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will get from selling the rope.

The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, let's determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and we need to know how many meters of the new rope Sarah plans to buy. Since the problem does not specify the length of the new rope, we'll assume she buys the same length as the original rope, which is 20 meters. Therefore, the cost of the new rope is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah gets from selling the original rope to find out how much money she will have left over:
\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, the final amount of money Sarah will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age.

If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can find her current age by subtracting 10 from 18:
\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]
So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let's denote the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be 24 as \( x \). Therefore, in \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be:
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - Total cost for bacon = $10.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one packet of chicken = $10 / 5 packs * 2 = $4.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost for chicken = 6 packets * $4 = $24.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost for strawberries = 3 packs * $4 = $12.

4. **Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost for apples = 7 packs * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
- Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left in her budget, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
- Money left = Budget - Total cost
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus a 15-minute encore. This means the final concert's runtime is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.

We are given that the runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \( 25 \) minutes.

Final answer:
25"

- Finally, he gives 30 toys to Nicky: \(80 - 30 = 50\)

So, Argo has 50 toys now."
"To find out how many chimichangas the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes on these three days, we need to add up the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

1. On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
2. On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
3. On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday and Wednesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we add these numbers together:

\[ 125 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 250 \text{ (Friday)} = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on these three days is 500."
"First, let's find out how many microphones won't find any space to fit in. Since 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged, we divide the number of microphones that can be paired by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

\[ \text{Final Answer: } 20 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He also counts \(\frac{2}{3}\) of that number of birds flying overhead. So, we need to calculate \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6\):
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
   \]
   So, 4 birds are flying overhead.
3. He sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we need to calculate \(3 \times 8\):
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   So, 24 birds are feeding.

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry counts:
\[
6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34
\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"Lani started with 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies, so she had:

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

Now, she placed the remaining 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide 50 by 5:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We do this by subtracting the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's find out how many indoor plants there are. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

So, there are 25 indoor plants.

Next, we need to find out how many plants are left after removing the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

So, there are 50 outdoor plants.

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find out how many flowering plants there are, we subtract the number of indoor and outdoor plants from the total number of plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of a thingamabob.
2. Use that speed to find the speed of a whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. So, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11.

\[
\text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. So, we can find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by 5.

\[
\text{Speed of a whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of the salad**: $6
2. **Cost of the yogurt**: Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, it costs \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.

Now, let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( x \). Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the cost for the carrots is \( 2x \).

The total cost for Ellen's daily diet is the sum of the costs of the carrots, the salad, and the yogurt. According to the problem, this total cost is $11. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 2x + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2x + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 1 \]

So, Ellen pays \(\boxed{1}\) dollar for one carrot every day."
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 an hour and got a raise of $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours he works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total earnings and the earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - We need to find out how much she made from mowing lawns and how much from lemonade sales.

2. **Define variables for the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - According to the problem, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Determine the payment for mowing each lawn:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
   - Let's assume the payment for mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is the same as Joe's, which is $6 per mow.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Earnings from Joe's lawn: \( 6J \)
   - Earnings from Kamala's lawn: \( 6 \times 3J = 18J \)
   - Earnings from Alba's lawn: \( 6 \times 5J = 30J \)
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns: \( 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \)

5. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns plus earnings from lemonade sales equals $80.
   - Let \( L \) be the earnings from lemonade sales.
   - Therefore, \( 54J + L = 80 \)

6. **Determine the value of \( J \):**
   - Since \( 54J \) must be a multiple of 6 (as each mow pays $6), and the total earnings are $80, we need to find a value of \( J \) that makes \( 54J \) a multiple of 6 and fits within the total earnings.
   - The only value of \( J \) that fits is \( J = 1 \) (since \( 54 \times 1 = 54 \), and \( 80 - 54 = 26 \), which is not a multiple of 6, and \( J = 0 \) would mean no earnings from mowing, which is not possible as it would mean all $80 came from lemonade, which is not fitting the problem's structure).

7. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - If \( J = 1 \), then \( 54J = 54 \).
   - Therefore, \( L = 80 - 54 = 26 \).

So, Tasha made \(\boxed{26}\) dollars from lemonade sales."
"First, let's find out Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we add 16 kg to Martin's weight:

Martin's weight = 55 kg
Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg = 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg

Next, we find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg = 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg

Finally, we determine Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg = 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting his car each month.

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. He gets paid $25 an hour.

So, the total hours he rents his car out each month is:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate his total earnings from renting the car:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting his car is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, we can find out how many she originally had by subtracting 5 from 7:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. Therefore, we calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had as follows:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Joseph had 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph after her purchase. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. We find the difference by subtracting the number of Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's find out how many miles Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we calculate Anis's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + \left( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \right) \]

\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance both Dijana and Anis rowed, we add their distances together:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \text{Anis's distance} \]

\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"First, we need to determine how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took 4 cookies.

Susan originally made 100 cookies. After her husband took 4 cookies, the number of cookies left is:
\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Next, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide 96 by 6:
\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get \(\boxed{16}\) cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each read:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

**Final Answer:**
15"
"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement to understand the total amount of soup.

Calvin and his wife are both adults, so they will need 2 adult bowls of soup. Additionally, they have two children, and each child will need 1 child's bowl of soup. Therefore, the total number of bowls needed for the family is:

\[ 2 \text{ (adult bowls)} + 2 \text{ (child bowls)} = 4 \text{ bowls} \]

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, and Calvin and his wife are the only adults, they will use 2 of those bowls. This leaves:

\[ 4 \text{ (total bowls)} - 2 \text{ (adult bowls used)} = 2 \text{ bowls} \]

These 2 remaining bowls are for the two children. Since each child needs 1 bowl, the 2 bowls can be split equally between the two children, giving each child:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 1 \text{ bowl per child} \]

So, each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Final answer:
Each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch."
"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- William bought 5 notebooks.

So, the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 5 \text{ notebooks} \times \$1.50 \text{ per notebook} = \$7.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.
- William bought 1 ballpen.

So, the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 1 \text{ ballpen} \times \$0.50 \text{ per ballpen} = \$0.50 \]

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:

Therefore, the total amount William spent is:
\[ \boxed{8.00} \]"
"To find out how much material Jo needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, let's calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4:
  \[
  \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask}
  \]
- For 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for 1 small mask by 20:
  \[
  0.5 \text{ yards/mask} \times 20 \text{ masks} = 10 \text{ yards}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3:
  \[
  \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask}
  \]
- For 8 large masks, we multiply the material needed for 1 large mask by 8:
  \[
  0.75 \text{ yards/mask} \times 8 \text{ masks} = 6 \text{ yards}
  \]

Finally, we add the material needed for the small and large masks together:
\[
10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
\]

So, Jo would need \boxed{16} yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount of money she spent by the total number of tickets she bought.

First, let's find the total number of times Deepa saw the movies. Since there are 9 movies and she saw each one 3 times, we multiply 9 by 3:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Deepa saw the movies 27 times, which means she bought 27 tickets.

Next, we need to find the average price per ticket. We do this by dividing the total amount of money she spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's break down Harold's daily activities and their durations:

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on these activities:
- Time spent sleeping: 10 hours
- Time spent working: 8 hours
- Time spent walking the dog: 1 hour

Adding these times together:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses and how many are left.

Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and uses 3 of them:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]
So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes left.

Next, let's figure out how many red shoe boxes Tim uses. He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his 9 red shoe boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]
So, Tim uses 3 red shoe boxes.

Now, we subtract the used red shoe boxes from the total number of red shoe boxes:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]
So, Tim has 6 red shoe boxes left.

Finally, we combine the remaining blue and red shoe boxes:
- Blue shoe boxes left: 4
- Red shoe boxes left: 6

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \text{ blue shoe boxes and } 6 \text{ red shoe boxes} \]

So, the total number of shoe boxes left is:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

Final answer:

"First, we determine how many books Joseph originally had. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, and Sarah has 9 books, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Joseph originally had 18 books. Next, we account for the fact that Joseph lost 2 of his books. We subtract 2 from the original number of books Joseph had:

\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]

Therefore, Joseph currently has \(\boxed{16}\) books."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Dean gives away:

\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \]

Dean originally had 30 marbles. After giving away 16 marbles, the number of marbles left for Dean is:

\[ 30 - 16 = 14 \]

So, Dean is left with 14 marbles."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the current ages of Duncan and Adam. Let's say Adam's current age is \( A \).

Given:
- Duncan's current age is 60.
- Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.

First, we express their ages eight and four years ago:
- Duncan's age eight years ago: \( 60 - 8 = 52 \)
- Adam's age four years ago: \( A - 4 \)

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So we can write the equation:
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Now, solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = \frac{60}{2} \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"First, let's find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm has. We know that Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. So, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Next, we add the sizes of both farms together to find the total number of acres:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

So, the two farms together have:
\[ \boxed{700} \text{ acres} \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We do this by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money he earns for completing 320 packages. Since he earns $0.20 for every package, we multiply the number of packages by the payment per package:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide 180 minutes by 30 minutes per bottle:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 30 \text{ minutes per bottle} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"To find out how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first need to calculate the total miles Jon drives in a month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven in a month is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles required for a tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs \(\boxed{3}\) tune-ups in that time."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Tuesday:**
   - Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   - Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday.
   - Time worked on Tuesday = 5 hours.
   - Time worked on Wednesday = \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

3. **Thursday:**
   - Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday.
   - Time worked on Wednesday = 10 hours.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 
   - They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons.
   - The price for 2 balloons is $0.5.
   - Therefore, the price for 12 balloons is \( \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \) dollars.
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 
   - They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[ 11 + 6 + 14 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

This is the total amount of money spent by Julia and Nadine. Since they combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount of their allowances is $31.

Since Julia and Nadine each received the same amount of allowance, we divide the total allowance by 2:
\[ \frac{31}{2} = 15.5 \]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{15.5}\) dollars."

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

1. **Junebugs removed on Monday:**
   \[
   39
   \]

2. **Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   Since she removed twice as many Junebugs as on Monday each day:
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ (for Tuesday)}
   \]
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ (for Wednesday)}
   \]

3. **Junebugs removed on Thursday:**
   \[
   48
   \]

4. **Junebugs removed on Friday:**
   \[
   57
   \]

Next, we sum the Junebugs removed each day to find the total:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300

"First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. So, the distance traveled by the bus is:

\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the car. The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. So, the distance traveled by the car is:

\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:

\[ 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

\[ \text{Final Answer: } 60 \, \text{miles} \]"

"Let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean with variables:
- Let \( P \) be the age of Peter.
- Let \( p \) be the age of Paul.
- Let \( j \) be the age of Jean.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( P + p + j = 100 \)
2. \( p = j + 10 \)
3. \( P = p + j \)

First, substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (j + 10) + j \]
\[ P = 2j + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( p = j + 10 \) and \( P = 2j + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[ (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 2j + 10 + j + 10 + j = 100 \]
\[ 4j + 20 = 100 \]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4j = 80 \]
Divide by 4:
\[ j = 20 \]

Now, find \( p \) and \( P \):
\[ p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2j + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( \boxed{50} \)."

\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes.

The total number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.

For Zoey:
- She has 40 seeds.
- Each seed is spat 10 feet.
- Total distance spat by Zoey = \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet.

For Sydney:
- She has 35 seeds.
- Each seed is spat 12 feet.
- Total distance spat by Sydney = \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet.

Next, we find the total distance spat by both of them combined:
- Total distance = Distance spat by Zoey + Distance spat by Sydney
- Total distance = \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet.

Now, we calculate the average total distance spat:
- Average distance = Total distance / Number of participants
- Average distance = \(820 / 2 = 410\) feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's calculate how many widgets each machine makes in a day.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- It makes 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- So, in one day, it makes \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- It makes 45 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- So, in one day, it makes \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets.

Next, let's calculate how many widgets each machine makes in a month (30 days).

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- In 30 days, it makes \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) widgets.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- In 30 days, it makes \(1080 \times 30 = 32400\) widgets.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- Revenue = \(43200 \times 6 = 259200\) dollars.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Revenue = \(32400 \times 6 = 194400\) dollars.

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

Difference in revenue = \(259200 - 194400 = 64800\) dollars.

So, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 than from the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's calculate the total time Cameron will stay at the hotel. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This is a total of 17 hours.

Next, we need to determine how much Cameron would pay if he opts for the 12-hour stay plus additional hours at 70 pesos per hour.

1. The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
2. The remaining time is 17 hours - 12 hours = 5 hours.
3. The cost for the additional 5 hours is 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.

So, the total cost for Cameron would be:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of a 24-hour stay, which is 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"First, let's find out how much hay each sheep needs. According to the problem, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. Since there are 15 goats and each needs 5 pounds, the total hay for the goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. Since there are 12 sheep and each needs 7 pounds, the total hay for the sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs. So, \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{159}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to subtract the amount he spent on gas:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John then wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract that amount:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. We do this by dividing the remaining money by the cost of one pen:

\[ 100 \text{ dollars} \div 25 \text{ dollars/pen} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. So, the total number of letters Craig spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we know that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig spelled to the number of letters his brother spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children from each school and then sum them up.

1. Each row has 8 children.
2. There are 7 rows for each school.
3. Therefore, the number of children in one school is \(8 \times 7 = 56\).
4. There are 5 different schools.

So, the total number of children from all 5 schools is \(56 \times 5 = 280\).

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:
\[ 9 \times 100 = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
\[ 29 \times 2 = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles the teacher has for herself:
\[ 900 - 58 = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:
\[ \boxed{842} \]"
"To find out how much Patty's Plumbing charged for the job, we need to add the visit charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: The job took 2.25 hours. Since the charge is $35 per hour (or part thereof), we calculate the labor charge as follows:
   \[
   2.25 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$83.75
   \]
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we add these amounts together:
\[
\$40 + \$83.75 + \$60 = \$183.75
\]

So, the total charge for the job is:
\[
\boxed{183.75}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. The money he spent on the CDs is $90, and the money he got from selling 5 of them is $200. However, since he only sold 5 out of the 10 CDs, we need to consider the cost of the 5 CDs he sold:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$75 \]

The discount on these 5 CDs is:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$75 = 0.40 \times \$75 = \$30 \]

So, the cost of the 5 CDs after the discount is:

\[ \$75 - \$30 = \$45 \]

James sold these 5 CDs for $200, so the net amount he gained from selling them is:

\[ \$200 - \$45 = \$155 \]

Finally, to find out how much money James was out, we subtract the money he gained from the total cost of the CDs:

\[ \$90 - \$155 = -\$65 \]

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $65. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which in this context means the initial amount he spent minus the money he got from selling the CDs. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{65} \]"
"To find out how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then add them together.

1. **Yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam is sold for $1.5.
   - Total earnings from yams = \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \) dollars.

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato is sold for $2.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) dollars.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots = \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Now, we add the earnings from all the root crops together:
\[ 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \]

So, if Jen sells everything, she will earn **34 dollars**."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - Total distance of the lake: 20 miles
   - Percentage of the distance he swims: 60%
   - Distance swum initially: \( 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \) miles

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   - Speed: 2 miles per hour
   - Time to swim 12 miles: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - Rest time is half the swimming time: \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance: 20 miles
   - Distance already swum: 12 miles
   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   - Original speed: 2 miles per hour
   - New speed: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \)

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Remaining distance: 8 miles
   - New speed: 1 mile per hour

"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from selling the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately.

**New York Times:**
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- Each copy costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 10\% \times \$5 = 0.10 \times \$5 = \$0.50 \]

Total commission from 6 copies:
\[ 6 \times \$0.50 = \$3.00 \]

**Wall Street Journal:**
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Each copy costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 8\% \times \$15 = 0.08 \times \$15 = \$1.20 \]

Total commission from 10 copies:
\[ 10 \times \$1.20 = \$12.00 \]

**Total Commission:**
Adding the commissions from both newspapers:
\[ \$3.00 + \$12.00 = \$15.00 \]

\[ \$15.00 \]"
"To find out how old Leo is, we can follow these steps:

1. We know Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is \(26 - 5 = 21\) years old.
3. Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, so if Marcus is 21, then Leo’s age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\).

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, let's express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the equation for \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."

Given:
- 100 pages are stacked to the inch.
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.

First, calculate the total number of pages in 1 inch:
\[ 100 \text{ pages/inch} \]

Since the book is 1.5 inches thick, we multiply the number of pages per inch by 1.5:
\[ 100 \text{ pages/inch} \times 1.5 \text{ inches} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the book has:
\[ \boxed{150} \text{ pages} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many hours Vince was stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert these hours into minutes because Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time difference is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Kim woke up earlier:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m. but woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - So, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

4. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep that day:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes.
   - Convert 7 hours and 55 minutes to minutes: \(7 \times 60 + 55 = 475\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the time Kim slept on her bed:**
   - Subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total time she was asleep.
   - \(475 - 23 = 452\) minutes.

So, Kim slept on her bed for **452 minutes** that day."
"First, let's find out how many measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, we calculate the number of measuring spoons he has:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, we subtract 6 from the 16 measuring spoons he originally had:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons remaining} \]

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of measuring cups to the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of beds currently occupied in the hospital:

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied. So, the number of occupied beds is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of unoccupied beds initially:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ unoccupied beds} \]

Now, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is:
\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients} \]

After 2 weeks, the number of occupied beds will be the initial number of occupied beds plus the number of new admissions:
\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ occupied beds} \]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:
\[ 1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ unoccupied beds} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's find out how many emails are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to determine how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. Two-thirds of the 9 emails are to family:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are left for her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

One-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. However, since we already found that 3 emails are left for her boyfriend, and this is the exact number, we can conclude that:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

So, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's find out how old Shawna is. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 times Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 × 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:

Shawna's father's age = 5 times Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 × 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to determine what number, when increased by 20%, equals the number Courtney reported, which is 48.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney overstated the number by 20%. This means Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number \( x \). We can express this relationship with the equation:
\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried based on the information given.

Let's say Jeffrey carried \( x \) balls. According to the problem:
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2x \) balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 4x = 7x \]

We are also given that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then:
- Jeffrey would have carried \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) ball.
- Jordan would have carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls.

So, the total number of balls carried would be:
\[ 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \]

Since the total number of balls is the same in both scenarios, we can set up the equation:
\[ 7x = 5 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{5}{7} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of balls, which is \( 7x \):
\[ 7x = 7 \times \frac{5}{7} = 5 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes
   - Total holes dug by the end of the third day: \(10 + 13 + 8 = 31\) holes

2. **Account for the holes filled in:**
   - On the third day, they filled in 2 holes.
   - Total holes after filling in: \(31 - 2 = 29\) holes

3. **Determine the number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.
   - Holes at the end of the first day: 10 holes
   - Four times this number: \(4 \times 10 = 40\) holes

4. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Holes at the end of the third day (after filling in): 29 holes
   - Holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 holes
   - Holes dug on the fourth day: \(40 - 29 = 11\) holes

Therefore, the pirates dug \(\boxed{11}\) holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."

"Let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan can be expressed as:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex can be expressed as:
\[ X = S + 5 = (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \]

The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ X + S + A = 339 \]
Substituting the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ (4A - 8) + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 4A - 8 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]
Add 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Divide both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know \( A = 40 \), we can find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan:
\[ S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. So, we calculate the number of episodes as follows:

\[
\text{Number of episodes} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes John will spend watching all the episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

\[
\text{Total minutes} = 10 \times 20 = 200
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Total distance flown north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

**Final Answer:**
374 miles"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over.

1. **Brownies made by Greta:**
   - Greta made one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.
   - Since one dozen equals 12 brownies, she made 12 brownies.

2. **Brownies received from the office:**
   - She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office.
   - 1/2 dozen is equal to 6 brownies (since 1 dozen = 12, so 1/2 dozen = 12/2 = 6).

3. **Brownies received from her friends:**
   - Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her.
   - 4 dozen is equal to 48 brownies (since 1 dozen = 12, so 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48).

4. **Total brownies before the party:**
   - Adding all the brownies together: 12 (from Greta) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.

5. **Brownies eaten during the party:**
   - During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   - 1 1/2 dozen is equal to 18 brownies (since 1 1/2 dozen = 1.5 * 12 = 18).

6. **Brownies left over:**
   - Subtract the brownies eaten from the total brownies: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, the final number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is **48**."
"First, let's find out the age of Nani's brother. Since Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, and Nani is 8 years old, we calculate:

\[ \text{Nani's brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out the age of Nani's sister. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of Nani's age} = 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \text{ years} \]

Since Nani's sister is 25% younger, we subtract this from Nani's age:

\[ \text{Nani's sister's age} = 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age:

\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

So, the total age of all three family members is:

\[ 30 \]"

So, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is **227 minutes**."
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The price of the first two phones is full price, so:
- Price of the first phone: $600
- Price of the second phone: $600

The remaining two phones are at half price, so:
- Price of the third phone: $600 / 2 = $300
- Price of the fourth phone: $600 / 2 = $300

Now, let's add up the total cost:
- Total cost = $600 (first phone) + $600 (second phone) + $300 (third phone) + $300 (fourth phone)

Total cost = $600 + $600 + $300 + $300 = $1800

So, John paid $1800 for all the phones."
"First, we need to find out how many players are on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of players in both teams combined. We do this by adding the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the total perimeter of the fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Total number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total number of slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's find out how many boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals:

\[2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes}\]

Next, we subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes she bought:

\[12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes}\]

These 8 boxes are the ones she kept and possibly sold. She kept 1/4 of these boxes for herself. So, the number of boxes she kept is:

\[\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes}\]

This means she sold the rest of the boxes, which is:

\[8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes}\]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:

\[6 \times 20 = 120\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[\boxed{120}\]"
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

To simplify this expression, we combine like terms:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the expression, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

So, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we need to find out how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books. He has already saved $14, so:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"First, let's break down the sales for each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 10 boxes
- Apple pie sold: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
- Apple pie sold: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes sold each day.

**Gingerbread:**
- On Saturday: 10 boxes
- On Sunday: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes

**Apple pie:**
- On Saturday: Let's denote the number of boxes sold on Sunday as \( x \). Therefore, on Saturday, he sold \( x - 4 \) boxes.
- On Sunday: 15 boxes

From the information given, we know that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. So, on Saturday, he sold:
\[ x - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we have the total number of boxes sold for each type of product over the two days.

**Total Gingerbread:**
\[ 10 \text{ (Saturday)} + 15 \text{ (Sunday)} = 25 \text{ boxes} \]

**Total Apple Pie:**
\[ 11 \text{ (Saturday)} + 15 \text{ (Sunday)} = 26 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of product.

**Earnings from Gingerbread:**
\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 \text{ per box} = \$150 \]

**Earnings from Apple Pie:**
\[ 26 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 \text{ per box} = \$390 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both products to find the total earnings for the two days.

\[ \$150 + \$390 = \$540 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Convert the width of the plants to feet:**
   - Each plant grows 12 inches wide. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each plant is \( \frac{12}{12} = 1 \) foot wide.

2. **Determine the space needed for each plant including the space between them:**
   - Each plant needs 1 foot for itself and 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant. So, each plant and the space between it and the next plant take up \( 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 \) feet.

3. **Calculate the total number of plants needed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant and the space between it and the next plant take up: \( \frac{111}{2.5} = 44.4 \).
   - Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

4. **Determine how many more plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants, so the number of additional plants needed is \( 44 - 17 = 27 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's break down the tasks:

1. **Peeling Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6:
     \[
     \frac{90}{6} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, we need to find out how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90:
     \[
     \frac{90}{30} = 3
     \]
   - Since it takes 10 minutes to sauté 30 shrimp, it will take:
     \[
     3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Now, we add the time for peeling and sautéing:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Low Speed Cooling:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 2 degrees per hour on low.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - So, the temperature drop during this period is \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\).

2. **High Speed Cooling:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 3 degrees per hour on high.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - So, the temperature drop during this period is \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\).

3. **No Air Conditioner Running:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.
   - It was turned off for 2 hours.
   - So, the temperature increase during this period is \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\).

4. **Total Temperature Change:**
   - Total cooling effect: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\).
   - Total warming effect: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\).
   - Net temperature change: \(18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\).

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Calculate the time between the first and second sightings of the comet:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

4. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years, then Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, Bill was **15 years old** when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, let's break it down by the frequency of each type of check he writes.

1. **Electric bill**: He writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: He writes one check per month for the gas bill. Similarly, for the gas bill, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month to the church. Therefore, for the church, he writes:
   \[
   2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter (3 months) to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

Now, we add up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks/year}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{52}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of flights the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips.
   - These 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips in one day.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's flights:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
   - So, the first plane makes \( \frac{1}{4} \) of its flights to France and Germany combined.

3. **Calculate the number of flights to France:**
   - The first plane makes \( \frac{1}{4} \) of its 88 flights to France.
   - Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{88}{4} = 22 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{22}
\]"
"First, let's find out how long each wolf howls:

1. **Tobias** howls for 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote** howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
3. **Igneous** howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, let's add up the total howling time for all three wolves:

- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 40 seconds
- Igneous: 60 seconds

Total howling time in seconds:
\[ 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total howling time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[ \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is **2 minutes**."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, let's break down the information given:

1. The cost of the trousers is $30.
2. Adam's mother gave him $6.
3. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Now, let's add the money given by his mother and father:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

So, Adam received a total of $18 from his parents. Since the trousers cost $30, we need to find out how much more Adam needs to pay:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, let's start by defining the variables and using the information given in the problem.

1. Let the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred be \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively.
2. We know the following:
   - \( A = 3 \) (Akbar's age)
   - \( B = 4 \) (Alessandro's age)
   - The total age of the children is 20.
   - Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can write the equation for the total age of the children:
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( B \):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

Since \( H + W = 13 \), we can substitute this into the average age formula:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{7 + 13}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

According to the problem, Helene's age \( H \) is twice this average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 13 - 10 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, let's find out how much money Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From his neighbors: $500
- From the online fund: $1500

Adding these amounts together:

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to include the $200 that Walter's friend is going to donate:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times the total amount collected from his neighbors, the online fund, and his friend. So, we need to multiply the total amount by 3:

\[ 2200 \times 3 = 6600 \]

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute:

\[ \boxed{6600} \]"
"First, let's find out how many cookies were brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find out how many people were in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first define the size of the slices. Let's say each kid gets a slice of size \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 2 \text{ (adults)} \times 2x \text{ (slices per adult)} + 4 \text{ (kids)} \times x \text{ (slices per kid)} = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \( 8x \). Each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \), so the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets \(\boxed{25\%}\) of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the appointments. Since he has 10 appointments and each takes 30 minutes, the total time for appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic gives us the time left for updating records:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \text{ hour} \]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time required for each step and then subtract this total from 5:00 pm.

1. **Making the cake batter:** 20 minutes
2. **Baking the cake:** 30 minutes
3. **Cooling the cake:** 2 hours (120 minutes)
4. **Frosting the cake:** 10 minutes

Now, let's add these times together:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.

If Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:

\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is **2:00 pm**."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:**
   - Lisa sold \(3.5\) boxes.
   - Peter sold \(4.5\) boxes.
   - Total boxes sold = \(3.5 + 4.5 = 8\) boxes.

2. **We know the total number of chocolate bars sold together is 64.**

3. **To find the number of chocolate bars in one box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:**
   \[
   \text{Number of chocolate bars per box} = \frac{64 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ boxes}} = 8 \text{ chocolate bars per box}
   \]

So, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session.
2. Calculate the total cost per day.
3. Calculate the total cost per week.
4. Calculate the total cost per month.

First, let's calculate the cost per session:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost per day:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost per week:
- Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost per month:
- The total cost per month is \(480 \times 1 = 480\) dollars.

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are \(\boxed{480}\)."
"First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes and each of Martha's boxes.

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Martha} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:

\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

**Final Answer: 8**"
"First, let's find out how many female porcupines there are. Since the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Babies born per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. Adding the babies born in a year to the initial population gives us the total number of porcupines after a year:

\[ \text{Total porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1490} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons needed:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Red Sticks**: There are 9 red sticks.
2. **Blue Sticks**: The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is:
   \[
   9 + 5 = 14
   \]
3. **Yellow Sticks**: The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is:
   \[
   14 - 3 = 11
   \]

Now, we add up all the sticks:
\[
9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34
\]

So, the total number of sticks is:
\[
\boxed{34}

"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Speed} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 55 \times 4 = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Speed} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 45 \times 10 = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 - 220 = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Brook Hills High School enrolls 3000 students in total.
- Half of these students are over 16 years old, so:
  \[
  \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \text{ students are over 16 years old}
  \]
- One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so:
  \[
  \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \text{ male students are over 16 years old}
  \]
- Therefore, the number of female students over 16 years old is:
  \[
  1500 - 375 = 1125 \text{ female students are over 16 years old}
  \]

- The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, so:
  \[
  \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \text{ students are under 16 years old}
  \]
- One-half of the students under 16 are male, so:
  \[
  \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \text{ male students are under 16 years old}
  \]
- Therefore, the number of female students under 16 years old is:
  \[
  1500 - 750 = 750 \text{ female students are under 16 years old}
  \]

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and the number of female students under 16 years old:
\[
1125 + 750 = 1875
\]

So, the total number of female students enrolled at this school is:
\[
\boxed{1875}

"First, let's find out how many laps each person can run in one hour.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. So, Bethany can run \(10 - 5 = 5\) more laps than Quinn.

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Before the Second Phase:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know this equals 28%, so:
     \[
     x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
     \]
   - Calculate \( (0.93)^3 \):
     \[
     (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357
     \]
   - So:
     \[
     x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
     \]

3. **Charge Before the First Phase:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know this equals 0.348, so:
     \[
     y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348
     \]
   - Calculate \( (0.91)^5 \):
     \[
     (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032
     \]
   - So:
     \[
     y \times 0.624032 = 0.348
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.557
     \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately **55.7%**."
"First, let's calculate how much Janet earns per hour in total. She earns $10 from wages and $15 from tips, so:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how much she wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of $10,000:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how much she earns in a week. She works 40 hours a week, so:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

So, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total spent so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining money is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, let's find out the total number of sweets Anne had:

- Anne's box contains 15 packs of sweets.
- Each pack has 60 pieces.

So, the total number of sweets is:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, Anne kept 2 packs for herself. Since each pack has 60 pieces, the number of pieces she kept is:
\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we subtract the number of pieces Anne kept from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces she gave to her friends:
\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. So, the number of pieces each friend received is:
\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received:
\[ 78 \text{ pieces} \]"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply a 5% increase each year to the original price of $120.

1. **First Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $120
   - Increase = 0.05 * $120 = $6
   - New price after first year = $120 + $6 = $126

2. **Second Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $126
   - Increase = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
   - New price after second year = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

3. **Third Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $132.30
   - Increase = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
   - New price after third year = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

**Final Answer:**
The price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"First, we need to find out how many pictures Olivia put in each album. Since she uploaded 72 pictures and divided them equally into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits only. This means there are:

- 3 albums of selfies, so \(3 \times 9 = 27\) selfies.
- 2 albums of portraits, so \(2 \times 9 = 18\) portraits.

To find the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the number of selfies and portraits together:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"First, we need to determine how long it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can find the time per page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time James spends reading is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of guests:** The hotel started with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkouts:** 24 guests checked out early.
   - Guests after early checkouts: \(100 - 24 = 76\)

3. **Late checkouts:** 15 guests opted for a late checkout.
   - Guests after late checkouts: \(76 - 15 = 61\)

4. **Afternoon check-ins:** Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   - Number of people who checked in: \(2 \times 15 = 30\)
   - Guests after afternoon check-ins: \(61 + 30 = 91\)

5. **Additional check-ins after dinner:** 7 more people checked in.
   - Final number of guests: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is **98**."

1. On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, he picks 6 bananas.
3. On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we add the bananas picked each day:
\[ 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22 \]

So, John has a total of 22 bananas."
"First, let's break down the total number of questions and categorize them:

- Total number of questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = \(0.40 \times 60 = 24\)
- Remaining questions: \(60 - 24 = 36\)
- These 36 questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions, so:
  - Average questions: \(36 \div 2 = 18\)
  - Difficult questions: \(36 \div 2 = 18\)

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct in each category:

- Easy questions: Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct.
  - Number of easy questions she gets correct: \(0.75 \times 24 = 18\)

- Average questions: Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct.
  - Number of average questions she gets correct: \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\)

- Difficult questions: Aries is also sure to get half of the difficult questions correct.
  - Number of difficult questions she gets correct: \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\)

Now, let's sum up the total number of questions she is sure to get correct:

- Total correct answers: \(18 + 9 + 9 = 36\)

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and a large stuffed animal costs three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large and small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can write the equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we have:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat per day and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

1. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
2. The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
3. The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

First, we add up the sandwiches eaten by each family member per day:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week (7 days):
\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \]

So, the family eats \(\boxed{77}\) sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate how much money Suzanne made from selling cookies and cupcakes.

From selling cookies:
80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80

From selling cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240

Total earnings from cookies and cupcakes:
$80 + $240 = $320

Next, we subtract the amount she gave to her sisters:
$320 - ($10 * 2) = $320 - $20 = $300

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:
$300"
"To find out how many eggs the friends found, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of eggs hidden**: 100 eggs.
2. **Eggs found by the Smith twins**: Each twin found 30 eggs, so together they found \(30 + 30 = 60\) eggs.
3. **Eggs left after the twins found theirs**: Subtract the eggs found by the twins from the total number of eggs: \(100 - 60 = 40\) eggs.
4. **Eggs found by friends**: All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. So, the number of eggs found by friends is \(40 - 10 = 30\) eggs.

Therefore, the friends found **30 eggs**."
"First, let's determine how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

1. One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much:
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe:
   \[
   24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe.

4. One dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.
5. Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine:
   \[
   40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]
6. Over 30 days, they can mine:
   \[
   1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds}

"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - It contains 2 sandwiches for $3.
   - Price per sandwich = \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) dollars.

2. For the second package:
   - It contains 4 sandwiches for $6.
   - Price per sandwich = \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) dollars.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.5.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- If each sandwich costs $1.5, then 8 sandwiches will cost \(8 \times 1.5 = 12\) dollars.

Therefore, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's find out how much Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set.

The cost of the new bedroom set is $3000, and he sells his old one for $1000. So, the amount he still needs to pay is:
\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this remaining amount each month. To find out how much 10% of $2000 is, we calculate:
\[ 2000 \times \frac{10}{100} = 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay \(\boxed{200}\) dollars per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally started with 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, she has:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

yellow balloons left. As she nears the school, she finds 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and adds 75% of them to her collection:

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \]

So, she adds 6 blue balloons to her collection. Now, we sum up all the balloons she has:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he doesn't have to turn it in and then subtract that from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there's a substitute, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.
   - Contribution to the final probability: \(0.50\)

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Combined probability: \(0.50 \times 0.40 = 0.20\)
   - Contribution to the final probability: \(0.20\)

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets an Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability: \(0.50 \times 0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.06\)
   - Contribution to the final probability: \(0.06\)

Now, we add up all the probabilities where Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework:
\[0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76\]

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the complement of the above probability:
\[1 - 0.76 = 0.24\]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[0.24 \times 100 = 24\%\]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **24%**."
"First, we need to find out how many seats are left for guests after accounting for the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

Total seats in the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Seats for guests = Total seats - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
Seats for guests = 6000 - 950 - 300
Seats for guests = 6000 - 1250
Seats for guests = 4750

Now, we need to split these 4750 seats equally among the 950 graduates.

Tickets per graduate = Seats for guests / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Since it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill him up, he can eat \(2 \times 75 = 150\) medium-sized jelly beans.

2. **Convert medium-sized jelly beans to small jelly beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean.
   - Therefore, to find out how many small jelly beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized jelly beans, we multiply 150 by 3.
   - So, \(150 \times 3 = 450\).

Therefore, Grandpa can eat \(\boxed{450}\) small jelly beans."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate her total earnings from the jury duty:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total parking expenses:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the parking expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find out how much she makes per hour after expenses by dividing her net earnings by the total number of hours:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes \(\boxed{2}\) dollars per hour after expenses."

"To determine how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - The number of intervals between bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \) intervals.
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Calculate the total time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.
   - To set off all 9 bottles, he needs to make 8 moves (since the first bottle doesn't require a move to set it off).
   - The total time is \( 8 \text{ moves} \times 5 \text{ seconds/move} = 40 \text{ seconds} \).

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is **40 seconds**."
"First, we need to find out how many apples Uncle Franky has in total. Since there are forty apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, we can calculate the total number of apples as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of apples he can make if each pack contains eight apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese Amor buys:

- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.

So, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is:
\[ 11 \text{ dollars/pound} \times 2 \text{ pounds} = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese Amor buys:

- The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese.

So, the cost of the Mozzarella cheese is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars/pound} \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese:

\[ 22 \text{ dollars} + 18 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the amount of money she started with:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim takes out for college. Since he takes out $50,000 per year and it takes him 4 years to finish, the total amount of loans is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's determine Jim's income before and after college. Before college, he earns $25,000 per year. After college, his income triples, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college. Since he would have worked for 4 years at $25,000 per year, his total income would have been:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

After college, he will earn $75,000 per year. We need to find out how long it will take for him to earn the equivalent of the $200,000 in loans plus the $100,000 in lost income, which totals:

\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

Since he earns $75,000 per year after college, the number of years it will take to earn $300,000 is:

\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

So, it will take Jim \(\boxed{4}\) years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Loss in the first race: \(-5\)

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Winning amount in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   - Win in the second race: \(+11\)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Loss in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)
   - Loss in the third race: \(-16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount won or lost:

- Total loss: \(-5 + (-16.5) = -21.5\)
- Total win: \(11\)

Net result:
- Net amount: \(-21.5 + 11 = -10.5\)

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net loss by the number of races (3):

\[
\text{Average loss per race} = \frac{-10.5}{3} = -3.5
\]

So, the average loss per race is \(-3.5\).

**Final numerical answer:**
\(-3.5\)"

1. **Number of countries in South America**: 26
2. **Number of cities in each country**: 5
3. **Population of each city**: 1000 people

First, we calculate the total number of cities in South America by multiplying the number of countries by the number of cities in each country:

\[
26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities}
\]

Next, we calculate the total population by multiplying the total number of cities by the population of each city:

\[
130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people}
\]

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is:

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation since the final heights of Cole and Xavier will be in inches.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:
\[ 1 \text{ inch} \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve this equation step by step.

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 3 weeks.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total fraction of a day worked each day:**
   - Each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.

3. **Calculate the total fraction of a day worked over 21 days:**
   - Since each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day for 21 days, the total fraction of a day worked by each painter is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times 21 = \frac{3 \times 21}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ days}
     \]

4. **Convert the total fraction of days into hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Therefore, the total hours worked by each painter is:
     \[
     7.875 \times 24 = 189 \text{ hours}
     \]

So, each painter put in \(\boxed{189}\) hours of work."

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can write the equation for the total number of balls as:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve this equation, first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year.

First, let's find the price of the car in 2008:
- Initial price in 2007: $20,000
- Depreciation rate: 21%

The price in 2008 is calculated as:
\[ \text{Price in 2008} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21) = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800 \]

Next, let's find the price of the car in 2009:
- Price in 2008: $15,800

The price in 2009 is calculated as:
\[ \text{Price in 2009} = 15800 \times (1 - 0.21) = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12482 \]

Finally, let's find the price of the car in 2010:
- Price in 2009: $12,482

The price in 2010 is calculated as:
\[ \text{Price in 2010} = 12482 \times (1 - 0.21) = 12482 \times 0.79 = 9837.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is \(\boxed{9837.78}\)."
"First, let's find out how many books are written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English:

\[ \text{English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, let's calculate how many books are in German. Since 10% of the books are in German:

\[ \text{German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{English books} + \text{German books}) \]
\[ \text{Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Spanish books} = 50 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Spanish books} = 20 \]

So, there are 20 Spanish books in the library."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Bernice has already driven. She drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days. So, we multiply 325 kilometers by 4:

\[ 325 \times 4 = 1300 \text{ kilometers} \]

Next, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance between San Diego and New York City:

\[ 1955 - 1300 = 655 \text{ kilometers} \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive:

\[ \boxed{655} \text{ kilometers} \]"
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply 8 cups/day by 30 days:

\[ 8 \, \text{cups/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 240 \, \text{cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days:

\[ 240 \, \text{cups} \div 16 \, \text{cups/gallon} = 15 \, \text{gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people get off the train, and twice that number (which is 100 people) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people get off the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is \(\boxed{110}\)."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Tank top**: $10
2. **Running shorts**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis shoes**: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic socks**: Package costs $8, but with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up all the costs:

- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Total cost: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent **$55** on athletic gear."
"To find out the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

So, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be **$2400**."
"First, let's find out how much the insurance costs after the increase due to the accident.

The normal cost of the insurance is $120 a month. It increased by 60%. To find the increase, we calculate 60% of $120:

\[ 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increase in cost is $72. Now, we add this increase to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

The new monthly cost of the insurance is $192. To find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays \(\boxed{2304}\) dollars a year."
"First, let's calculate the total number of sheets Greg uses in a year.

Greg puts clean sheets on:
- 4 twin beds every week
- 1 king size bed every week

Since he changes the sheets every week, in a year (52 weeks), he will use:
- \(4 \text{ twin beds} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 208 \text{ twin sheets}\)
- \(1 \text{ king size bed} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 52 \text{ king sheets}\)

Next, we need to determine how many loads of laundry he needs to do. The machine can wash:
- 2 twin sets of sheets at a time
- 1 king set of sheets at a time

For the twin sheets:
- \(208 \text{ twin sheets} \div 2 \text{ twin sheets per load} = 104 \text{ loads}\)

For the king sheets:
- \(52 \text{ king sheets} \div 1 \text{ king sheet per load} = 52 \text{ loads}\)

Adding these together, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is:
- \(104 \text{ loads} + 52 \text{ loads} = 156 \text{ loads}\)

So, the final numerical answer is:
156"
"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - So, on Sunday, they watch \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies.

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   - Total movies on Saturday and Sunday = 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

4. **Movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   - Since they watch 6 movies each weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) movies.

**Final Answer:**
24"
"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection now, let's break down the information given:

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, he collected 50 more stickers, so the total number of stickers he had at the end of last year is:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150
   \]
3. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers he collected last year. Since he collected 50 stickers last year, this year he collected:
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100
   \]
4. Adding this year's collection to the total from last year gives us the current total number of stickers:
   \[
   150 + 100 = 250
   \]

So, the final number of stickers in Leo's collection is:
\[
250

"First, let's calculate how much cat food Imma's cats consume in one day.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of food twice a day. So, the total amount of food consumed by all the cats in one feeding is:
\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} = 180 \text{ grams} \]

Since the cats are fed twice a day, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 180 \text{ grams/feeding} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate based on the information given.

1. **Becky's Slices:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.

2. **Jake's Slices:**
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

3. **Silvia's Slices:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

Next, we add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia to find the total number of slices eaten.

\[
10 \text{ (Becky's slices)} + 7 \text{ (Jake's slices)} + 14 \text{ (Silvia's slices)} = 31 \text{ slices}
\]

So, the total number of slices they ate is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( D \). We do this by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part is 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took \(\boxed{58}\) minutes."
"To find the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual costs.

1. **Cost of the cast:** $200
2. **Cost of the visit:** The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is:
   \[
   300 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of painkillers:** Each pill costs $4, and she needs 30 pills, so the cost is:
   \[
   4 \text{ dollars/pill} \times 30 \text{ pills} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking:** The doctor charges $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the cost is:
   \[
   6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482
\]

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:
\[
\boxed{482}

20% of 80 emails don't require any response:
\[ 20\% \times 80 = 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \text{ emails} \]

So, the number of emails that do require a response each day is:
\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \text{ emails} \]

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:
\[ 64 \text{ emails/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 320 \text{ emails} \]

"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we add these numbers together:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score for the 4 tests.
2. Divide the total score by the number of tests (which is 4).

First, let's calculate the total score:
- John scored 100 on each of his first 3 tests, so for these 3 tests, the total score is \(100 + 100 + 100 = 300\).
- He scored 80 on his 4th test.
- Therefore, the total score for all 4 tests is \(300 + 80 = 380\).

Next, we find the average score by dividing the total score by the number of tests:
\[ \text{Average score} = \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is \(\boxed{95}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many big coupons Anthony is sending out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so for 700 small coupons, the cost is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so for 1400 big coupons, the cost is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of the small coupons and the cost of the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"

2. **Calculate the number of meatballs in the initial order:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - \(7 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 28 \text{ meatballs}\).

3. **Determine how many meatballs Mark ate:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(4 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 16 \text{ meatballs}\).

4. **Calculate the number of meatballs remaining after Mark ate:**
   - \(28 \text{ meatballs} - 16 \text{ meatballs} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

5. **Determine the number of additional meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - \(3 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

6. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches:**
   - The remaining meatballs from the initial order plus the additional meatballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of butter needed:**
   - Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
   - He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   - Therefore, he needs \(6 \times 1 = 6\) pounds of butter.

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   - The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off.""
   - This means for every pound of butter bought, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the cost per pound:**
   - The regular price of butter is $4.00 per pound.
   - With the promotion, the price for the half pound is \( \frac{4.00}{2} = 2.00 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half price.
   - Therefore, for 6 pounds, he will get 6 half pounds for free.
   - This means he only needs to pay for 6 pounds of butter.

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost for 6 pounds of butter at $4.00 per pound is \(6 \times 4.00 = 24.00\) dollars.

So, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is **$24.00**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the actual number of guests attending the party is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 guests * $6/guest = $126

Now, we add the rental fee to the cost for the additional guests:

$125 + $126 = $251

The final cost of the party is:

$251"
"First, let's determine how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left. This means the $60 is three-quarters of her initial amount. We can set up the equation to find out how much she originally had:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial amount} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial amount, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial amount} = 60 \div \frac{3}{4} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie originally had $80. Since she spent a quarter of it, she spent:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
\]

Thus, Maggie has $60 left.

Next, Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left. This means the $60 is two-thirds of her initial amount. We can set up the equation to find out how much she originally had:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial amount} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial amount, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial amount} = 60 \div \frac{2}{3} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza originally had $90. Since she spent one-third of it, she spent:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

Thus, Riza has $60 left.

Now, we add the amounts of money Maggie and Riza have left:

\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Maggie and Riza have left is:

\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"First, let's find out how many bananas all three monkeys eat in a day.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
3. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we need to know the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day and subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys.

First, calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day:
\[10 + 14 = 24\]

Next, we need to find out how many bananas are eaten by all three monkeys in a day. Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week (7 days), the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \]

Now, subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten in a day to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats:
\[45 - 24 = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of 15 roses.

- The cost of one rose is $2.
- Therefore, the cost of 15 roses is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Jenny brought with her.

- Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills.
- Therefore, the total amount of money she brought is \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much more money Jenny needs to buy the roses.

- The cost of the roses is $30.
- Jenny has $25.
- Therefore, the additional amount needed is \( 30 - 25 = 5 \) dollars.

Since the florist does not have the exact change in dollar bills, Jenny will need to pay the extra $5 with quarters. 

- Each quarter is worth $0.25.
- To find out how many quarters are needed for $5, we divide $5 by $0.25: \( \frac{5}{0.25} = 20 \) quarters.

Since Jenny needs to pay $5 with quarters and the florist only gives quarters as change, Jenny will leave with 20 quarters.

"Let's break down the timing of each train's arrival and departure to find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 minutes to arrive + 20 minutes to stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs.
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the first train arrives (10 minutes + 30 minutes).
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 minutes to arrive + 5 minutes to stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 65 minutes after the second train departs.
   - Arrives 130 minutes after the first train arrives (60 minutes + 70 minutes).
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 130 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs.
   - Arrives 150 minutes after the first train arrives (130 minutes + 20 minutes).

Paul will board the fourth train, which arrives 150 minutes after the first train arrives. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, Paul will wait 140 minutes (150 minutes - 10 minutes) for his train.

**Final Answer:**
140 minutes"
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number needed.

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week.

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. So, the price Mr. Rogers paid is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, the selling price to his friend is:
\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. The original price of the watch is $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800. The discount is:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To find out how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one second:**
   - One spring creates 1 jellyfish every second.

2. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, in one hour, one spring creates \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) jellyfish.

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - In 4 hours, one spring would create \(4 \times 3600 = 14400\) jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs would create \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\) jellyfish.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Distance to the Store**: The store is 4 miles away from James's home.

2. **Halfway Point**: James walks halfway to the store, which is:
   \[
   \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Realization and Return**: James realizes he forgot something at home and walks back the 2 miles he had already covered. So, he walks an additional 2 miles back home.

4. **Total Distance Walked**: The total distance James walks is:
   \[
   2 \text{ miles (to halfway)} + 2 \text{ miles (back home)} = 4 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Walking Speed**: James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

6. **Time Calculation**: To find the time it takes to walk 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

So, the total time it took James to reach the store is **1 hour**."
"First, let's calculate how many bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches.

Each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas. So, for 10 bunches:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought these 40 bananas individually.

Each banana costs $0.80. So, for 40 bananas:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the 10 bunches.

Each bunch costs $3.00. So, for 10 bunches:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Finally, let's find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The difference in cost is:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, the growth per year is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the yearly growth by 13:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold.

1. **Trekking Bikes:**
   - Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Number of Trekking bikes = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \).

2. **BMX Bikes:**
   - 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - Number of BMX bikes = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \).

3. **MTB Bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
   - Number of MTB bikes = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \).

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Earnings from Trekking Bikes:**
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450.
   - Total earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \).

2. **Earnings from BMX Bikes:**
   - Price of one BMX bike = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \).
   - Total earnings from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \).

3. **Earnings from MTB Bikes:**
   - Price of one MTB bike = $500.
   - Total earnings from MTB bikes = \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \).

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings.

- Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
- Total earnings = \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \).

Therefore, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of bales made by the farmer in one hour:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.

2. **Determine the number of bales picked up by the truck in one hour:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.

3. **Calculate the net number of bales added to the field each hour:**
   - Each hour, the farmer makes 5 bales, but the truck picks up 3 bales.
   - Net bales added per hour = \(5 - 3 = 2\) bales.

4. **Calculate the total number of bales added to the field over 6 hours:**
   - Since 2 bales are added each hour, over 6 hours, the total number of bales added is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) bales.

5. **Determine the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours:**
   - Since the problem does not specify the initial number of bales in the field, we assume the field starts with 0 bales.
   - Therefore, after 6 hours, the number of bales left in the field is 12.

**Final Answer:**
12"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

Total class time per day = 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total class time for the week is:

Total class time per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on these days.

Extra learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week * (1/16) = 100 minutes/week

Now, we add the class time and the extra learning time to get the total learning time per week:

Total learning time per week = 1600 minutes (class time) + 100 minutes (extra learning) = 1700 minutes/week

To convert the total learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total learning time in hours = 1700 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 28.33 hours/week

So, the final answer is:

28.33 hours/week"
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

**Step 1: Determine the initial height.**
The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. So, the initial height is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the height after the first bounce.**
The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the height after the second bounce.**
The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child, who is 6 feet tall, is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:

\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples per bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's work through the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate:**
   - The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops.
   - This means the T-Rex left half of the triceratops.
   - Let the original weight of the triceratops be \( x \) kilograms.
   - After the T-Rex ate, \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms of meat were left.

2. **Determine the amount of meat left after the velociraptors scavenged:**
   - The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex.
   - This means they left half of \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - So, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \).

3. **Determine the amount of meat left before the Allosaurus ate:**
   - The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat.
   - This means the amount of meat left before the Allosaurus ate is 270 kilograms.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) by 4.
   - \( x = 270 \times 4 \)
   - \( x = 1080 \)

So, the original weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was **1080 kilograms**."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall.

The north and south walls are both 10 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are both 5 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, let's find the total area of all four walls:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial conditions:
- Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
- She shakes 3 of them.
- She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
- Out of the 11 sodas, 3 are shaken and 8 are unshaken.

Next, Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas:
- After Ellen's brother takes the sodas, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda:
- There are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas, making a total of 8 sodas.
- The probability of getting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

The probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
\[ 25\% \]"
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, the distance it travels is:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
   \]
   After 3 hours, the distance it travels is:
   \[
   30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. To find the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we add the distances each train has traveled:
   \[
   180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
   \]

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- Therefore, the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Next, we need to find out how many days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off.

- 20% of 50 days is \(0.20 \times 50 = 10\) days.

So, the number of days he works is \(50 - 10 = 40\) days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he helps per day is:

- \(2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day}\).

Now, we calculate the total number of people he helps over the 40 days he works:

- \(6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people}\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people that the buses could carry is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people that the cars could carry is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people that the buses and cars could carry to find the total number of people:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to ride the biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to ride the second biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time:
\[ \text{Difference} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
- He also takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes.

So, the total time spent on breaks each day is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 30 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, the total time spent on lunch and breaks each day is 1 hour.

Now, we need to find out how much time he spends on lunch and breaks over 5 days:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's find out how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate:

\[ \text{Miles Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total miles run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total:

\[ \text{Miles Ahito ran} = 52 - (\text{Miles Amber ran} + \text{Miles Micah ran}) \]
\[ \text{Miles Ahito ran} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Miles Ahito ran} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Miles Ahito ran} = 16 \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Charge:**
   Sheila initially charged $85.00.

2. **Return of Item:**
   She returned an item that cost $15.00. So, we subtract this from the initial charge.
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **New Purchase:**
   Sheila bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, calculate the discount on the frying pan:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   Then, subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

4. **Second New Purchase:**
   She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. First, calculate the discount on the towels:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   Then, subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the total number of jellyfish in the tank be \( J \).

2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).

3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).

4. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, \( \frac{J}{15} = 6 \).

5. To find \( J \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   \frac{J}{15} = 6
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 15:
   \[
   J = 6 \times 15 = 90
   \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

**Final Answer:**

\[ \text{Ben's age} = 2 \times \text{Chris's age} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Now, we know Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, we can calculate Caroline's age as:

\[ \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her $100,000 salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual Savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount needed for retirement:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary during retirement. Her current salary is $100,000, so:
   \[
   \text{Annual Retirement Expense} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Since she plans to live off this amount for 20 years, the total amount needed for retirement is:
   \[
   \text{Total Retirement Savings Needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many years Lauren needs to save:**
   Lauren saves $20,000 each year. To find out how many years she needs to save $800,000, we divide the total amount needed by her annual savings:
   \[
   \text{Years Needed to Save} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

So, Lauren needs to work for **40 years** to save enough for her retirement."
"First, we need to find the length of each of the 4 equal parts that Marty cuts from the 100 centimeters of ribbon.

To do this, we divide 100 centimeters by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters} \]

So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

Next, we need to divide each of these 25 centimeter parts into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 centimeters by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long. 

The final answer is:
\[ 5 \text{ centimeters} \]"
"To find the total population of the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school by \( P \).

Since 40% of \( P \) is 240, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of 600:
\[ 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"First, let's add the cost of the pots and the garden soil:

"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total height of all the heels:
- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels. So, the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels. So, the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Now, add these two totals together to get the overall total height of the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Next, we need to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\[\frac{18}{6} = 3\] inches.

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\) inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in June.
2. Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike.
3. Calculate the number of miles she plans to hike per day.
4. Determine how many more miles per day she needs to hike to complete her journey.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in June.**
June has 30 days.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike.**
Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of miles she plans to hike per day.**
Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, she plans to hike:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

**Step 4: Determine how many more miles per day she needs to hike to complete her journey.**
To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we need to see if the 250 miles per day is enough to cover 9,300 miles in 30 days. We can calculate the total miles she would hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles} \]

Since 7,500 miles is less than 9,300 miles, she needs to hike more miles per day. The additional miles needed per day can be calculated as follows:
\[ \frac{9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

**Final Answer:**
Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

\[ 27 + 55 + 75 = 157 \]

Therefore, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's find out how much Pierre and Paul want.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

So, the total amount of apples bought is 12 kg, and Pierre and Paul together want 7 kg. This means James will have:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

James will have \(\boxed{5}\) kilograms left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius.
2. It dropped by 8 degrees Celsius overnight. So, we subtract 8 from 2:
   \[
   2 - 8 = -6
   \]
   The temperature after the drop is -6 degrees Celsius.
3. In the morning, the temperature increased by 3 degrees Celsius. So, we add 3 to -6:
   \[
   -6 + 3 = -3
   \]
   The temperature in the morning is -3 degrees Celsius.

Therefore, the temperature in the morning was \(-3\) degrees Celsius."

"First, let's figure out how much money Anna spent in total. She started with $16 and has $2 left. So, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that she had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount she spent on the 2 books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost $5. 

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

First, we know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We need to find out how many minutes (\(x\)) it will take for the light to blink 459 times.

We can set up the proportion as follows:

\[
\frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{x \text{ minutes}}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we can cross-multiply and then solve the equation:

\[
255x = 459 \times 5
\]

\[
255x = 2295
\]

Now, divide both sides by 255 to solve for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{2295}{255}
\]

\[
x = 9
\]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

**Final Answer:**
9 minutes"
"First, let's calculate the initial number of each type of fish:

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan's chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior's chore took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours + 1 hour (since it's ""well over 4 hours longer"") = 9 hours.

Now, we add up the total time taken by all three to complete their chores:

\[
4 \text{ hours (Amalia)} + 6 \text{ hours (Megan)} + 9 \text{ hours (Dior)} = 19 \text{ hours}

"First, let's calculate how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will walk in 7 days as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days:

\[ \text{Distance Brian walks in 7 days} = \frac{\text{Distance Sofie walks in 7 days}}{2} \]

Substituting the distance Sofie walks in 7 days:

\[ \text{Distance Brian walks in 7 days} = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour. So, in 10 hours, each of these workers produces:
\[ 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ toys} \]
Since there are two such workers, the total production from these two workers is:
\[ 60 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 120 \text{ toys} \]

The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour. So, in 10 hours, each of these workers produces:
\[ 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ toys} \]
Since there are two such workers, the total production from these two workers is:
\[ 40 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Adding the production of the first four workers together, we get:
\[ 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys. This means that the total number of toys produced by the five workers is:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Therefore, the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's find the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we add the weights of all the dogs together to find the total weight.

3. Total weight of all dogs:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. **Rob received 7 stickers from Kris.** Before giving 7 stickers to Rob, Kris had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.

2. **Kris received 16 stickers from Luis.** Since Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.

3. **Luis received 32 stickers from Seth.** Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

So, Seth had **64 stickers** in the beginning."
"First, let's find out how many ounces of M&M John has in total. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. So, the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many M&M are in those 30 ounces. Since 1 ounce contains 30 M&M, 30 ounces will contain:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M} \]

Now, if John puts 10 M&M in each small bag, the number of small bags he can make is:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M}}{10 \text{ M&M per bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"

"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that speed to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, we calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Eggs Painted:**
   Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.

2. **Eggs Painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as \( S \). Therefore, Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.

   We can set up the equation:
   \[
   S + (S + 12) = 30
   \]
   Simplifying this:
   \[
   2S + 12 = 30
   \]
   Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   2S = 18
   \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[
   S = 9
   \]
   So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted:
   \[
   S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Eggs Painted by Arnold and Madeline:**
   Arnold and Madeline together painted the remaining eggs. Since Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, the remaining eggs are:
   \[
   56 - 30 = 26
   \]
   Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, let's denote the number of eggs each painted as \( A \). Therefore:
   \[
   2A = 26
   \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[
   A = 13
   \]
   So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, and Madeline also painted 13 eggs.

4. **Difference in Eggs Painted by Camden and Arnold:**
   Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. The difference is:
   \[
   21 - 13 = 8
   \]

**Final Answer:**
Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

So, Nik can make 25 groups of crayons.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. Since each group of crayons goes into a box, he will need 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert the total weight to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's find out how much of the tree can be made into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree.

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 80 \text{ feet} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from these 64 feet of wood.

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet per log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks per log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2 \text{ per plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"First, let's find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's earnings} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Valerie's mother earns. Her mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary of Valerie and her brother} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Now, we calculate the mother's earnings:

\[ \text{Mother's earnings} = 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

Finally, we add up the earnings of Valerie, her brother, and her mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is:

"First, let's determine Grandma's speed on the beach. If she spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach, her speed on the beach is:

\[ \text{Speed on beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Since her speed on the sidewalk is \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\), it takes her 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Next, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She saves $4 every week and has been saving for 8 weeks.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal.

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining $28, given that she saves $4 each week.

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we need to add up the birds in each group of trees.

First, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 3 trees that each had 7 blue birds:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Then, we note that the 1 final tree had 3 blue birds:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:

"First, let's find out how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if we subtract the 24 marbles he will receive from the total of 60 marbles, we can find out how many marbles he originally has.

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36 to find out how many marbles he will have left.

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, he will have 26 marbles left.

**Final Answer: 26**"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, which means the average temperature of the mixed water is at least 40 degrees.

The total amount of water in the bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces. The equation for the average temperature of the mixed water is:

\[
\frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, we simplify the numerator:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the inequality by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Then, we isolate \( T \) by subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}

"To find the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over that period and then add them to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
3. **Cows added per day**: 20
4. **Chickens added per day**: 10
5. **Number of days in three weeks**: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over 21 days:

- **Total cows added**: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- **Total chickens added**: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Next, add the initial numbers to the totals added:

- **Total cows**: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
- **Total chickens**: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Finally, add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:

- **Total animals**: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

**Final answer**: 700"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in 4 packs:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per single bagel by dividing the total cost by the number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
   \]

2. **Find out how many scoops make up 1 less than 3 scoops:**
   1 less than 3 scoops is:
   \[
   3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops}
   \]

3. **Determine how many potatoes are needed for 2 scoops:**
   It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops.
   \[
   6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, we need to find out how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops.
   \[
   \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ sets of 2 scoops}
   \]
   Each set of 2 scoops requires 3 potatoes, so for 9 sets:
   \[
   9 \times 3 = 27 \text{ potatoes}
   \]

Therefore, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is:
\[

Now, let's add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:

\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \text{ dozens} \]"
"First, let's find out how many red jellybeans there are. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, we can calculate the number of red jellybeans as follows:

Number of red jellybeans = 2 × Number of green jellybeans
Number of red jellybeans = 2 × 17
Number of red jellybeans = 34

Now, we know the total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. We can find out how many blue jellybeans there are by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jellybeans = 9

So, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar."

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to find the number of men and women:

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

Next, we need to find out how many women remain on the bus after 20 women alight. Initially, there are 54 women, and 20 women leave, so the number of women remaining is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

### Step 1: Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. This can be written as a probability of 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of each ticket winning. So, we multiply the probabilities of the two events:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

### Final Answer
The probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"First, let's find out how many seashells Carlos collected. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find the number of seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27.

\[ \text{Carlos's seashells} = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, we can find the number of seashells Carrey collected by dividing the number of seashells Carlos collected by 2.

\[ \text{Carrey's seashells} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = \text{Jim's seashells} + \text{Carlos's seashells} + \text{Carrey's seashells} \]
\[ \text{Total seashells} = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They decided to divide all the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, we divide the total number of seashells by 3.

\[ \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

So, each person gets 20 seashells."

"First, let's determine how many of the octuplets are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue.

Since Carla has 8 octuplets:
- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows.

- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
- Blue-wearers wearing bows: 2
- Purple-wearers wearing bows: 2

The total number of babies wearing bows is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Since 2 out of the 4 babies wearing bows are wearing purple, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this to a percentage:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells a quarter of the remaining land for $30.
   - A quarter of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total eggs hidden by Cole**: Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

2. **Eggs found by Lamar**: Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. **Eggs found by Stacy**: Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar. So, Stacy finds \(2 \times 5 = 10\) eggs.

4. **Eggs found by Charlie**: Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy. So, Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

5. **Eggs found by Mei**: Mei finds half as many as Charlie. So, Mei finds \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by all the children:

- Lamar: 5 eggs
- Stacy: 10 eggs
- Charlie: 8 eggs
- Mei: 4 eggs

Total eggs found = \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

4. **8-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
5. **9-year-old avocado tree**: Doesn't produce any fruit.
6. **10-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ fruits}
   \]

Now, let's find out how many fruits an 8-year-old tree produces. According to the problem, an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one:
\[
1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ fruits}
\]

Next, we sum up the fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
\]

Adding these together:
\[
50 + 150 = 200
\]
\[
200 + 350 = 550
\]
\[
550 + 800 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 0 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 1000 = 2350
\]

So, the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is:
\[
\boxed{2350}
\]"
"First, let's find out how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia gave him \(\frac{1}{5}\) of her $100.

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
\]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20.

Now, let's add this amount to the money Jack originally had.

Jack originally had $100. After receiving $20 from Sophia, the total amount of money Jack has now is:

\[
100 + 20 = 120
\]

Therefore, Jack now has \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope in centimeters.
- The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope is \( Y - 7 \) centimeters.
- The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4 \times (Y - 7) \) centimeters.

According to the problem, the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Y + (Y - 7) + 4 \times (Y - 7) = 37 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve this equation step by step:
\[ Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 37 + 35 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = \frac{72}{6} \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

So, the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters. Now, we can find the length of the blue rope:
\[ \text{Length of the blue rope} = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

And the length of the red rope:
\[ \text{Length of the red rope} = 4 \times (Y - 7) = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ centimeters} \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his little sister, so he is left with:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total amount of paint used:**
   The mural used a total of 12 pints of paint.

2. **Determine the distribution of the paint:**
   - Half of the mural is yellow.
   - The remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple paint.

3. **Calculate the amount of yellow paint:**
   Since half of the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining amount of paint:**
   The remaining paint is:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

5. **Determine the amount of red paint:**
   The remaining 6 pints of paint are divided equally among red, white, and purple paint. Therefore, the amount of red paint is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
   \]

So, the number of pints of red paint used is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width. So, for one bedroom:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 240 \, \text{square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \, \text{square feet} = 960 \, \text{square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:

\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \, \text{square feet} = 1200 \, \text{square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \, \text{square feet} + 1200 \, \text{square feet} + 1000 \, \text{square feet} = 3160 \, \text{square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To find out how many clouds Alice counted in total over the five days, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and then add them all together.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we add up all the clouds counted from Monday to Friday:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

So, the total number of clouds Alice counted over the five days is:
\[ \boxed{93} \]"
"First, let's determine how many pods are in the special size box. The regular box has 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

To find 20% of 100:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. We need to find out how many pods you get for $1. Since $12 buys 120 pods, $1 will buy:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pods}}{12} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

If you use 1 pod per cycle, then with $1, you can run:
\[ 10 \text{ cycles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is **16**."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Chalk used = 45% of 5 inches = \(0.45 \times 5 = 2.25\) inches.
   - Chalk remaining = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches.

3. **Daily Usage**: The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day.
   - Daily usage = 20% of the remaining chalk.

4. **Determine When to Recycle**: The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.

5. **Calculate Remaining Days**:
   - On the first day (Tuesday), the teacher uses 20% of 2.75 inches.
     - Chalk used = 20% of 2.75 inches = \(0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55\) inches.
     - Chalk remaining = 2.75 inches - 0.55 inches = 2.2 inches.
   - On the second day (Wednesday), the teacher uses 20% of 2.2 inches.
     - Chalk used = 20% of 2.2 inches = \(0.20 \times 2.2 = 0.44\) inches.
     - Chalk remaining = 2.2 inches - 0.44 inches = 1.76 inches.

Since 1.76 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on Wednesday.

**Final Answer**: The teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"First, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 girls are on varsity.

Next, let's find out how many boys are on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

So, 3 boys are on varsity.

Now, let's find out the total number of students on varsity:

\[ 4 \text{ (girls on varsity)} + 3 \text{ (boys on varsity)} = 7 \]

The total number of students in the class is:

\[ 12 \text{ (boys)} + 12 \text{ (girls)} = 24 \]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon.

Total cost = 4000 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $14000

Next, we need to find out how much milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus realized that 2/5 of the milk was sour.

Amount of sour milk = 2/5 * 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons

Now, we calculate the refund amount based on the cost per gallon for the sour milk.

Refund amount = 1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[
W = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently \(\boxed{20}\) years old."
"First, let's find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that 100 books cost $500. 

To find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy with $27000, we divide $27000 by $500:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. So, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Now, since Bob distributes the money equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books each school gets:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school. 

**Final Answer: 1800 books per school.**"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picked up the two apples.

2. **First Action:**
   - Newton put one apple in his pocket.
   - He threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up these 5 apples.
   - He put all but one of these 5 apples in his pocket.
   - He threw the remaining one apple at the tree.

3. **Second Action:**
   - Newton picked up all the remaining apples (which were 4, since he put 4 in his pocket and threw 1 at the tree).

Now, let's count the apples Newton brought home:

- Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples.
- After the first action, he added 4 more apples to his pocket.
- After the second action, he added the remaining 4 apples to his pocket.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is:
\[ 1 \text{ (from the first action)} + 4 \text{ (from the second action)} = 5 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To find out the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many 50 kg bags are needed to deliver 850 kg of coal.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags and the cost per bag.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of bags needed.**

Since each bag contains 50 kg of coal, we divide the total amount of coal by the weight of each bag:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each bag costs $18, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is:
\[ \boxed{306} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many slices of each type of pizza Kate's friends will eat in total.

Each friend eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

Since Kate has 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten will be:
- Cheese pizza: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Now, let's determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are needed.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Total slices needed: 36
- Number of cheese pizzas needed: \(\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\)

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Total slices needed: 24
- Number of pepperoni pizzas needed: \(\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\)

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas together:
- Total pizzas needed: \(3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas}\)

So, Kate needs to buy \(\boxed{6}\) pizza pies."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the net gain of snowballs per 15 minutes:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour (60 minutes).
   - In 15 minutes, he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Calculate how many 15-minute intervals are needed to get 60 snowballs:**
   - We need a total of 60 snowballs.
   - Since Jay gains 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, we divide 60 by 3 to find the number of 15-minute intervals needed: \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.

3. **Convert the number of 15-minute intervals into hours:**
   - Each interval is 15 minutes, so 20 intervals are \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.
   - Convert minutes to hours: \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary:**
   - Since the question doesn't specify the current year, we can assume that the current year is the year of Digimon's 20th anniversary. Therefore, the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary is 20 years.

2. **Calculate John's age 20 years ago:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age 20 years ago:**
   - According to the problem, 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) years old 20 years ago.

4. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since Jim was 4 years old, Jim is now \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find out how many slices they all ate, we add up the slices:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

So, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \(12 - 28 = -16\) bandages, but since they can't have negative bandages, this means they needed 16 more bandages to meet the demand, so they ordered another bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Therefore, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 16 = 34\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \(50 \times 2 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they had \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\) bandages, but the problem states they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means they must have used some bandages from the initial stock to balance the equation.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \(x\). Then, the total number of bandages they had at the end of the third day can be expressed as:
\[ x + 100 - 25 - 78 = 0 \]
\[ x + 100 - 103 = 0 \]
\[ x - 3 = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, the nurses started with \(\boxed{3}\) bandages on the first day."

"First, let's find out how much blood a single shark has. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood a shark has as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks would have:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \text{ gallons} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. The number that came in first is 50, so 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, let's add all these numbers together to find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (at 10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
\]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"To find out how many pens Alain has, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, determine the number of red pens:
   - Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
   - Each pack contains 5 pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of red pens is \(5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ pens}\).

2. Next, determine the number of black pens:
   - Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens.
   - Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is \(2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ pens}\).

3. Finally, calculate the total number of pens:
   - The total number of pens is the sum of the red pens and the black pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of pens is \(25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens}\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{75}

"First, let's find the cost of one bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost of each bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost of a bottle of scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**First Day:**
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

**Second Day:**
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, so he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

**Total Trees Planted:**
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

"To find the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as \( x \).

According to the problem, ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40."" This can be written as:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

2. Divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \( 8 \).

"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. One-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we know that 5/11 of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

42"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had.

Amy had:
- Two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Next, we account for the colors stolen by her sister and the colors Amy used up.

Her sister steals one of the palettes, which has 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which originally had 6 colors:
\[6 \div 2 = 3\]
So, she uses up 3 colors from one makeup set, leaving her with:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[19\]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Mattison's height = 60 inches.
2. His house is 7 times as high as he is.
3. The first floor's ceiling height is 3 times his height.

Now, let's calculate each part:

1. Height of the house = 7 times Mattison's height = \(7 \times 60 = 420\) inches.
2. Height of the first floor's ceiling = 3 times Mattison's height = \(3 \times 60 = 180\) inches.

Since the house is two stories, the total height of the house is the sum of the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor. We already know the total height of the house and the height of the first floor, so we can find the height of the second floor:

Height of the second floor = Total height of the house - Height of the first floor's ceiling
= 420 inches - 180 inches
= 240 inches.

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"First, let's find out how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \text{ shells} \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their shells:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \text{ shells} \]

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 420 = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \text{ shells} \]

Now, we subtract the shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells to find out how many shells team Gogetters found:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \text{ shells} \]

So, team Gogetters found:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total miles all four dogs need to walk per day.
2. Subtract the miles the first three dogs need from the total to find out how many miles the last dog needs.

First, we know the average miles per day for all four dogs is 3 miles. So, the total miles for all four dogs is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add up the miles the first three dogs need:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we subtract the miles the first three dogs need from the total miles to find out how many miles the last dog needs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"First, we need to find out how much John got from the loan. The loan is worth 40% of the value of his house, which is worth $250,000.

To find 40% of $250,000, we calculate:
\[ 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

So, John got a loan of $100,000.

Next, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts. To find out how much he used to pay off his debts, we calculate:
\[ 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

So, John used $60,000 to pay off his debts.

To find out how much money he had leftover, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the total loan amount:
\[ 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debt is:
\[ \boxed{40000} \]"

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the third tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

So, the total weight of the tunas is:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling these tunas. If a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, then the total earnings will be:
\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's find the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

To calculate this, we can simplify the multiplication:

\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99 \]

So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier on each setting:

1. **Low setting**: Removes 1 liter per day.
2. **Medium setting**: Removes twice as much as the low setting, so \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters per day.
3. **High setting**: Removes twice as much as the medium setting, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters per day.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water removed for each period:

- **Low setting for 3 days**: \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\).
- **Medium setting for 3 days**: \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\).
- **High setting for 5 days**: \(4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Finally, we add up the amounts from each period to get the total:

"First, let's find the capacity of one of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity for John's school} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we know the capacity of Ali's class is 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest.

The interest on $300 at 2% is:
\[ 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we calculate how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 each month for 11 months:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

Now, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he needs to return to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month:

Therefore, the final amount Ali has to pay John is:
\[ \$100 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \( 32 \) feet."

"First, let's calculate the cost of the basic manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The basic manicure costs $35 and the pedicure costs $40. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

With a 20% discount, the amount of the discount is:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, we need to add the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand). The cost of nail art per nail is $3, so the total cost for nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Adding the cost of the nail art to the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure, the total amount Karen would pay is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, let's break down the information given:

1. Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each.
2. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.
3. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine.

First, calculate the total number of issues from the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
\[ 3 \text{ magazines} \times 12 \text{ issues/magazine} = 36 \text{ issues} \]

Next, calculate the number of issues from the magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 6 \text{ issues} \]

Then, calculate the number of issues from the last magazine, which sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, add up all the issues from each magazine to find the total number of magazines she gets every year:
\[ 36 \text{ issues} + 6 \text{ issues} + 24 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ issues} \]

So, the total number of magazines (issues) Susan gets every year is:
\[ 66 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how many paintings Kim has, let's break down the information step by step.

1. Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we let \( S \) be the number of paintings Shelley has, we can write:
   \[
   S = 27 + 12 = 39
   \]
   So, Shelley has 39 paintings.
3. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. If we let \( K \) be the number of paintings Kim has, we can write:
   \[
   S = K + 8
   \]
   Since we know \( S = 39 \), we can substitute and solve for \( K \):
   \[
   39 = K + 8
   \]
   Subtract 8 from both sides to find \( K \):
   \[
   K = 39 - 8 = 31
   \]

So, Kim has \(\boxed{31}\) paintings."
"First, let's calculate the price of the toy after the 80% increase in December.

The original price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price went up by 80% of $40.

To find 80% of $40:
\[ 80\% \times 40 = 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price after a 50% decrease, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from $72.

50% of $72 is:
\[ 50\% \times 72 = 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \]

So, the price in January after the decrease is:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 4 lessons at his standard rate.

Charlie's standard rate is $80 per hour. For 4 lessons, he earns:
\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the reduced rate for the lessons with the veteran. The rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is:
\[ 80 - (0.25 \times 80) = 80 - 20 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

For 2 lessons with the veteran, he earns:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 20:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]
So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's find out how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples.

\[ \text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some is:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is:

\[ \text{Apples given to sister} = 25\% \times 36 = \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 9 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total money he received is:

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels are 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \). We can do this by isolating \( x \) on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{9 \times 4}{3} = \frac{36}{3} = 12 \]

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.**

Michael's speed is 50 km/hr. If he travels for 24 hours a day (assuming he doesn't stop at all, which is not realistic but we'll use this for calculation), the distance he travels in one day is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 24 \text{ hr/day} = 1200 \text{ km/day} \]

Over 3 days, the total distance he travels is:
\[ 1200 \text{ km/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

**Step 2: Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.**

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. The percentage of this distance that Michael has covered is:

   - An 8-hour day = \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.
   - Percentage of the day spent cleaning = \( \frac{240}{480} \times 100 = 50\% \).

So, on average, the custodian spends **50%** of their day cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. So, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.

Now, to find the number of blueberry cubes, we substitute \( S = 20 \) into the expression for blueberry cubes:

\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add up all the water needed:
\[ 2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups} \]

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To find out how long it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to hop on land and swim in water, and then add these times together.

1. **Total Distance**: Phineas is 200 yards away from his home. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the distance on land is 100 yards, and the distance in water is also 100 yards.

2. **Time to Hop on Land**: 
   - Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
   - Distance on land = 100 yards
   - Time to hop on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

3. **Time to Swim in Water**: 
   - Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
   - Distance in water = 100 yards
   - Time to swim in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

4. **Total Time**: 
   - Total time = Time to hop on land + Time to swim in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

So, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home."
"First, we need to determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks needed by the number of popsicle sticks per box:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is:

\[ \$14.00 \]"
"The main phone plan costs $20, and each additional phone costs half as much as the main phone. So, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

There are four additional phones, so the cost for the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

**Final Answer:**
$60"

"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we need to determine how long it will take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. We do this by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Conor saw 50 people.

2. **Second Day:**
   - The number of people increased by 20 from the first day.
   - So, the number of people on the second day = 50 + 20 = 70.

3. **Third Day:**
   - The number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day.
   - So, the number of people on the third day = 2 × 70 = 140.

4. **Rest of the Week:**
   - Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week.
   - There are 7 days in a week, and we have already accounted for 3 days, so there are 4 days left.
   - Total number of people seen on the remaining 4 days = 60 × 4 = 240.

5. **Total Number of People:**
   - Now, we add up the number of people seen each day.
   - Total = 50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining 4 days).

Let's calculate the total:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 \]

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is **500**."

"To find out the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each size of t-shirt and then add them together.

1. **Small T-shirts:**
   - Each small t-shirt is 3 square feet.
   - Octavia uses 11 small t-shirts.
   - Total square footage from small t-shirts: \( 11 \times 3 = 33 \) square feet.

2. **Medium T-shirts:**
   - Each medium t-shirt is 4 square feet.
   - Octavia uses 8 medium t-shirts.
   - Total square footage from medium t-shirts: \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \) square feet.

3. **Large T-shirts:**
   - Each large t-shirt is 6 square feet.
   - Octavia uses 6 large t-shirts.
   - Total square footage from large t-shirts: \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) square feet.

Now, we add the square footage from all the t-shirts together:

\[
33 + 32 + 36 = 101
\]

So, the total square footage of the quilt is **101 square feet**."
"First, let's find out how many seeds a small sunflower has. Since a dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many seeds a large sunflower has. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \]

So, a large sunflower has:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both sunflowers, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower together:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is:

\[ 90 \]"
"First, let's find out how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

\[ \text{Timothy's pens} = 3 \times \text{George's pens} = 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so we calculate Sarah's pens as follows:

\[ \text{Sarah's pens} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's pens} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27 \]

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens."
"First, let's find out how tall Anne is. Since Albert is 36 inches tall and Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is:

\[ 36 \times 2 = 72 \text{ inches tall} \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. So, Jackie's current height is:

\[ 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer. Therefore, her height before the summer was:

\[ 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

So, Jackie was \(\boxed{67}\) inches tall before the summer."
"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in one day.
2. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the bars produced in two weeks.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of bars produced in one day.**
The company produces 5000 bars per day.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.**
There are 14 days in two weeks. So, the total number of bars produced in two weeks is:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the bars produced in two weeks.**
The company sells each bar for $2. So, the total revenue is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the company will receive \(\boxed{140000}\) dollars for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

1. The first T-shirt costs $8.
2. The second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs \(8 \times 0.5 = 4\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost for the T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The shoes are 40% off the original price of $40.

The discount on the shoes is:
\[ 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the price Jake pays for the shoes is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan earned from his allowance over 3 weeks.

Ryan earns $6 each week, so for 3 weeks, he earns:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Since each ice cream cone costs $1.25, the total cost for 4 ice cream cones is:
\[ 1.25 \times 4 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream from his total allowance to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Ryan and his 3 friends want to go to the movies, and each movie ticket costs $6.50. We need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. We do this by dividing the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

Since Ryan can only buy whole movie tickets, the number of movie tickets he can buy is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Ellen spent:

- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.

Next, let's calculate how much Lani spent:

- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- She also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100.

So, the cost of the two bathrobes is:
\[ 100 \times 2 = 200 \]

Adding the cost of the sunglasses:
\[ 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, we add Ellen's and Lani's total spending to find out how much they spent in all:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

Therefore, the total amount they spent is:
\[ \boxed{335} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar of the mixture.

- **Passion fruit cost for one jar:**
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$12
  \]

- **Jackfruit cost for one jar:**
  \[
  1.5 \text{ pounds} \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$12
  \]

- **Honey cost for one jar:**
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$20
  \]

Next, we add up the costs to find the total cost for one jar:

\$12 + \$12 + \$20 = \$44
\]

Tim sells each jar for $50. Therefore, the profit from one jar is:
\[
\$50 - \$44 = \$6
\]

To find the profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit from one jar by 10:
\[
\$6 \times 10 = \$60
\]

So, the final profit from selling 10 jars is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Justin has 32 quarters.
   - Value of quarters = \( 32 \times 0.25 = 8 \) dollars.

2. **Dimes:**
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Justin has 95 dimes.
   - Value of dimes = \( 95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \) dollars.

3. **Nickels:**
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Justin has 120 nickels.
   - Value of nickels = \( 120 \times 0.05 = 6 \) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes while the dog continues to dig new ones. Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 holes a day, so the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

We need to find out how many days it takes for Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of eggs in the second basket.
2. Add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket.

First, we know there are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket. So, we calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as follows:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

So, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's find out how much each person raised:

2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up all the amounts to find the total:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

So, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"First, let's determine how far Aaron ran. According to the problem, Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron ran half of that distance:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron was twice as fast as Vanessa, it means that for every mile Vanessa runs, Aaron would take twice as long. Therefore, to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 1 mile, we can use the following calculation:

\[ \text{Time for Vanessa to run 1 mile} = 16 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can now calculate the total time she took to complete her part of the race:

\[ \text{Total time for Vanessa} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 32 \text{ minutes per mile} = 128 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 128 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of line needed:**
   - The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
   - There are 200 feet of dock.
   - Therefore, the total amount of line needed is \( 3 \times 200 = 600 \) feet.

2. **Subtract the amount of line he already has:**
   - He already has 6 feet of new line.
   - Therefore, the amount of line he needs to buy is \( 600 - 6 = 594 \) feet.

So, the caretaker needs to buy **594 feet** of line in total."

"First, let's find out the cost price of each watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = \$1.60 \]

Next, we need to calculate the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Selling price} = \text{Cost price} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) = 1.60 \times 1.25 = \$2.00 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

James is twice as old as Dora, so James's current age is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since James is currently 18 and John had James when he was 19, John's current age is:
\[ 19 + 18 = 37 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we need to determine the age of John's youngest son. The problem states that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Since John is currently 37, his youngest son's current age is:
\[ 37 - 32 = 5 \text{ years old} \]

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off.

To find 80% of $400:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is $320.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

To find the total cost for the mechanic:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

So, the cost for the mechanic is $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid:

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( C \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( K \) be the number of cows.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + K = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, let's find out the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 7 pizzas is cut into 8 slices, we multiply 7 by 8:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

So, there are 56 slices of pizza in total.

Next, we need to divide these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends. This means the slices need to be divided among 4 people:

\[ 56 \div 4 = 14 \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
