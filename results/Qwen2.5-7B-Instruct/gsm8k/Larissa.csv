"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs she uses is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the amount she makes from selling the eggs is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts of fiber."
"To calculate Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repairs) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's find the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we calculate 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

150% of $80,000 is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000."
"James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, and each sprint is 60 meters.

To find the total distance he runs in a week, we can multiply the number of sprints per session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of times he does this per week.

So, the calculation is:

\(3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}\)

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters a week."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken eats in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily feed requirement to find the final meal amount.

Step 1: Each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day.

Step 2: Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total for these two meals is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Step 3: The total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Now, subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily requirement to find the final meal amount:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can break this down into 8 pairs of glasses, where each pair consists of one glass at $5 and one glass at $3.

For each pair:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.

So, the cost for each pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost is:
8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
Charleston = 4 * Seattle
Charleston = 4 * 20
Charleston = 80

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
Toulouse = 2 * Charleston
Toulouse = 2 * 80
Toulouse = 160

Now, we add up the sheep from all three cities:
Total sheep = Seattle + Charleston + Toulouse
Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160
Total sheep = 260

The final numerical answer is:
260"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

6. **Add the total time for the download:**
   - Total time = 60 minutes (first 40%) + 20 minutes (update) + 60 minutes (remaining 120%) = 140 minutes

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 140 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - He then drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives the remaining time of 4 hours - 2 hours (standstill) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours at 80 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance covered on the return trip = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John was initially 180 miles away from home.
   - He covered 135 miles on his return trip.
   - Distance remaining from home = Initial distance - Distance covered on return trip = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

So, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."
"Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10. For the first 40 hours, she earns at this rate. For the additional 5 hours (overtime), she earns 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.

Regular earnings for 40 hours:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Overtime earnings for 5 hours:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times (1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour}) = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Total earnings for the week:

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%, so the downloads were 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. Cost of donuts:
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
   - Cost of donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204

2. Cost of mini cupcakes:
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
   - Cost of mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160

3. Cost of mini cheesecakes:
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
   - Cost of mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330

Now, we add up the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Growth**: 7 lemons per year
3. **Selling Price per Lemon**: $1.5
4. **Annual Cost to Water and Feed**: $3

First, calculate the net profit per year:

- Revenue from selling lemons: \(7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}\)
- Cost to water and feed the tree: \$3/year
- Net profit per year: \(\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5/\text{year}\)

Next, we need to find the number of years (\(n\)) it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of planting the tree:

\[ \text{Net profit per year} \times n = \text{Initial cost} \]
\[ \$7.5 \times n = \$90 \]

Solving for \(n\):

\[ n = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**Final Answer: 12 years**"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale.

4. According to the problem, after all these sales, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

5. To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

6. Add 2 to both sides:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

7. Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

8. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

18"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance:

20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students to find out how many are left:

20 students - 4 students = 16 students

Next, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of the remaining 16 students:

25% of 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many are left for hip-hop dance:

16 students - 4 students = 12 students

Finally, to find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:

(12 students / 20 students) * 100 = 60%

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 + ($5,000 * 2.5%) = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

2. **Electronic gadgets:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 + ($8,000 * 1.2%) = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Now, we compare the final values:
- Jewelry: $5,125
- Electronic gadgets: $8,096

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the electronic gadgets, as they will be worth $8,096 at the end of the month.

**Final profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96**

The final numerical answer is:
$96"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

So, the final numerical answer is:

230 miles"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we sum up her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Her annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire eats 3 eggs every day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats:
3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week

Step 3: In 4 weeks, she eats:
21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs

Step 4: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert 84 eggs into dozens:
84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
2. Determine the remaining distance she needs to cover.
3. Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance.

First, let's find the total time Marissa has to complete the hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour. The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. Using the formula for average speed:

\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} \]

We can rearrange this to find the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and another hour on the next 2 miles, so she has spent a total of 2 hours so far. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the hike is:

\[ \text{Remaining time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to cover is:

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula for speed:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

6 miles per hour"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately, then account for the spill, and finally sum the remaining water.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters ≈ 6.67 liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = 9 liters.

3. **Account for the spill:**
   - We spill 1 liter of the orange drink, which means we lose \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 1 liter of water (since the orange drink is two-thirds water).
   - Amount of water spilled = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 \) liter = \( \frac{2}{3} \) liters ≈ 0.67 liters.

4. **Calculate the remaining water in the orange drink:**
   - Remaining water in the orange drink = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters - \( \frac{2}{3} \) liters = \( \frac{18}{3} \) liters = 6 liters.

5. **Calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters:**
   - Total water = Water from the remaining orange drink + Water from the pineapple drink
   - Total water = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

The final numerical answer is:
15 liters"
"Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine the age difference between when Raymond had his son and his current age.

Raymond's current age is 25, and he had his son at 23. So, the son was born 25 - 23 = 2 years ago.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
"Billy sold DVDs to 8 customers on Tuesday. 

- The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD, so that's 3 DVDs.
- The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs, so that's 4 DVDs.

"Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find the original price \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
3. 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
4. Let the number of boxes of pizza be \( x \). Each box costs $8.50, so the total cost for the pizza is \( 8.50x \).

The total cost is the sum of all these items, which equals $50. So we can write the equation:

\[ 12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 33 + 8.50x = 50 \]
\[ 8.50x = 50 - 33 \]
\[ 8.50x = 17 \]
\[ x = \frac{17}{8.50} \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

2 boxes of pizza."
"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of item and then sum them up.

"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will need is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream."
"Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. 

To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance from his first stop to the end of the trip and then subtract the 15 miles before the end.

The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is:
60 miles (total trip) - 20 miles (first stop) = 40 miles

Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end, he traveled:
40 miles - 15 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. One pair of high heels costs $33.
2. The other pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs $33 * 2 = $66.
3. Together, the two pairs of high heels cost $33 + $66 = $99.
4. The two pairs of high heels cost five dollars less than the boots, so the boots cost $99 + $5 = $104.

Therefore, the boots cost $104.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote Darrell's current age as \(7x\) and Allen's current age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x = 9\) into the expression for Allen's age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first one's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than that is 60.

The third friend guesses 25% more than the first one's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

To find the average guess, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses:

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"John spends 0.5 hours per dog each day. With 10 dogs, he spends:

0.5 hours/dog/day * 10 dogs = 5 hours/day

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"If Raymond has 40 jewels, then half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 

25% of 4 points is \(4 \times 0.25 = 1\) point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \(4 + 1 = 5\) points.

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is \(4 + 5 = 9\) points.

Total points scored: 9"
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he earns:

13 lego sets * $15/lego set = $195

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends:

8 video games * $20/video game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left, so the total amount he spent plus the money he has left should equal the amount he earned from selling the lego sets:

$195 (earned) = $160 (spent on video games) + $5 (left over)

Now, the question asks how many lego sets he still has. Since he sold all 13 lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:

0 lego sets

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed per mile. We know that speed is calculated as distance divided by time.

First, let's determine the total time John spends running each week.

- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day, so each of those days he runs for \(3 \div 2 = 1.5\) hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time he runs in a week:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

John runs a total of 60 miles a week. To find his average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour."
"Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and that her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can determine her running speed. If her skipping speed is half her running speed, then her running speed is:

\[ \text{Running speed} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed:

\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we know the time allocation for running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period. Therefore, the time spent running is:

\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

And the time spent walking is:

\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she travels while running and walking. The distance traveled while running is:

\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The distance traveled while walking is:

\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance traveled in six hours:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"If Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone, then with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. 

So, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. Therefore, the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can stand and still hit the dragon is:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pie pieces initially was:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is the difference between the initial number of pieces and the remaining pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content of the entire bag of chips:**
   - A serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in a 300g bag.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the bag are \( 250 \times 5 = 1250 \) calories.

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are \( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \) calories.

3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since a 300g bag contains 1250 calories, the calorie content per gram is \( \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \) calories per gram.
   - To find out how many grams you can eat with 200 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram: \( \frac{200}{4.17} \approx 48 \) grams.

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of beeswax are needed to make 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Determine how many pounds of beeswax are needed to make 20 candles.
Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the supplies.
The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
The net profit is:
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
\[ 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \]

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work: 220.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes remaining: 23.

So, the calculation is:

80 (initial) - 220 (used at work) - 23 (remaining) = -163

Since the result is negative, it indicates that the number of Post-it notes in the package must be 163 to make the equation correct. 

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163.

163"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from a 4-foot piece of wire, we first need to convert the length of the wire into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, a 4-foot piece of wire is:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece:

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor has 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

"Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can calculate the number of dozens produced per day as follows:

252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozen eggs per day

Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen. Therefore, his daily earnings from selling eggs are:

21 dozen eggs per day * $2 per dozen = $42 per day

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week

Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Without the distance, we cannot determine the exact time it takes for Tom to travel back.

If we assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles, then:

1. The time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours.
2. The speed on the way back is 6 mph.

The distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find the time it takes to travel back at 6 mph:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes:

Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. So, the total weight of the comic books is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. If 7.5 pounds of that weight is from the comic books, then the remaining weight to be removed by the toys is:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day and then find the difference.

**Thursday:**

- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Truck tires: 0 tires × $60 per tire = $0
- Car tires: 12 tires × $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $0 + $480 = $480

**Difference in revenue:**
- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Friday's revenue: $480
- Difference: $520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday."
"The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have just had kittens. 

Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.

Trixie has had 12 kittens.

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is the sum of the adopted kittens and the kittens from their house cats:

\(7 + 21 + 12 = 40\)

Jean can fill 14 bags."
"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of one movie outing and then see how many such outings he can afford with his $42.

The cost of one movie outing is the sum of the ticket and the popcorn:
\[ \text{Cost of one outing} = \$7 + \$7 = \$14 \]

Now, we divide the total amount of money Peter has by the cost of one outing to find out how many times he can go:
\[ \text{Number of outings} = \frac{\$42}{\$14} = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times."
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the maximum weight the bridge can carry.
2. Subtract the weight of the empty truck and driver from the bridge's weight limit to find out how much weight is available for the boxes.
3. Divide the available weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.
2. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
3. The available weight for the boxes is \(5000 - 3755 = 1245\) pounds.
4. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is \(1245 \div 15 = 83\).

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year.

1. For the first half of the year (6 months), the charge is $140 per month.
2. For the second half of the year (6 months), the charge is 10% less than $140 per month.

First, let's calculate the charge for the second half of the year:
- 10% of $140 is \( 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \).
- So, the charge for the second half of the year is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) per month.

Now, let's calculate the total for each half of the year:
- For the first 6 months: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \).
- For the second 6 months: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \).

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total for the year:
- Total amount paid = \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \).

The total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) efficiency. We know that she traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. 

To find the mpg, we divide the miles traveled by the gallons of gas used:

\[ \text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg} \]

Now that we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how far she can drive on a full 12-gallon tank:

1. Each school has sent 2 teams (girls' and boys' basketball teams).
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school has also sent 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 2 coaches

Therefore, the total number of people sent by one school is:
- Total people per school = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:
- Total people = 4 schools * 12 people/school = 48 people

"Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total allowance she receives is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. This total is the sum of the money she started with and the allowance she received. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes in a week.

First, let's find the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes every weekday (Monday to Friday), so that's \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- She teaches 8 classes on Saturday, so that's 8 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\) classes.

Next, let's find the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, the total number of students is \(33 \times 15 = 495\) students.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money she makes in a week:

"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for the 3-month period.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the final amount.
4. Divide the final amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The cost of one cell phone is $150, and Shiela bought five of them.
   \[
   \text{Total cost before interest} = 5 \times 150 = 750
   \]

2. A 2% interest is charged for each unit. Since there are five units, the total interest is:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 5 \times (150 \times 0.02) = 5 \times 3 = 15
   \]

3. Adding the total interest to the total cost gives:
   \[
   \text{Total amount to be paid} = 750 + 15 = 765
   \]

4. To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by 3:
   \[

"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Now, let's calculate the total sales for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, let's add up the total sales:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. Level 3: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. Bottom level (Level 4): \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Now, we can find the total square footage of the sandcastle by summing the square footage of all levels:

\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year, the first year will have 365 - 180 = 185 days remaining after the first 180 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy will consume:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy will consume:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

So, in the first year, the puppy will consume a total of:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year is:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the two different package options and then find the difference in cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:

1. Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
2. Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:

1. Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
2. Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:

1. Cost difference: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{6.00}

"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30% of $100.

30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

So, the discount amount is $30.

Subtract the discount from the original cost:

$100 - $30 = $70

The final cost of the grooming is $70."
"Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, so:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, they together got:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water given to the girls and the boy is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters, so the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

10 liters of water were left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

3. He receives 23 more stickers for his birthday, so now he has \(31 + 23 = 54\) stickers.
4. He gives 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has \(54 - 9 = 45\) stickers.
5. He uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has \(45 - 28 = 17\) stickers.

Therefore, the final number of stickers Charlie has left is 17."
"Grace weighs 125 pounds.

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, so we calculate Alex's weight as follows:

4 times Grace's weight: \(4 \times 125 = 500\) pounds
Alex's weight: \(500 - 2 = 498\) pounds

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's and Alex's weights together:

\(125 + 498 = 623\) pounds

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."
"To find the total number of thorns, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses.
2. Calculate the total number of thorns based on the number of roses.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses.
Dan plants 3 rose bushes, and each rose bush has 25 roses.
So, the total number of roses is:
\[ 3 \text{ rose bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of thorns.
Each rose has 8 thorns.
So, the total number of thorns is:
\[ 75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns} \]

Therefore, the total number of thorns is:
\[ 600 \]"
"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

According to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games, so we have:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

The team won 8 more games than they lost, so we have:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The final numerical answer is:

"The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which means it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, which means it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of rings from each time it went off:

4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22 times.

The alarm rang 22 times in all."
"Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. The company increases the salary by 10% every year for those who've stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just clocked 5 years in the company, her salary will be increased by 10% each year for the next three years.

Let's calculate her salary step by step for each of the next three years:

1. **First Year (Year 6):**
   - Initial salary: $600
   - Increase: 10% of $600 = $600 * 0.10 = $60
   - New salary: $600 + $60 = $660

2. **Second Year (Year 7):**
   - New salary: $660
   - Increase: 10% of $660 = $660 * 0.10 = $66
   - New salary: $660 + $66 = $726

3. **Third Year (Year 8):**
   - New salary: $726
   - Increase: 10% of $726 = $726 * 0.10 = $72.60
   - New salary: $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

So, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will be $798.60."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is:

"Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them don't show up. So, the number of guests who will show up is:

\[ 16 - \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 16\right) = 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Since Christina needs .75 gift bags per invited guest, the total number of gift bags she needs is:

\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Christina will spend $18."
"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of potato salad one child will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the adults.
3. Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the children.
4. Add the amounts from steps 2 and 3 to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

Step 1: One child will eat half as much as an adult. Since an adult eats 10 lbs, a child will eat:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \]

Step 2: The total amount of potato salad for the 20 adults is:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Step 3: The total amount of potato salad for the 5 children is:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Step 4: Adding the amounts from steps 2 and 3 gives:
\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."

"Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. If Lee now runs it in 38 seconds, then before the diet change, Gerald would have run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald improved his speed by 10% due to his diet change. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his old time and subtract that from his old time.

10% of 40 seconds is 0.10 * 40 = 4 seconds.

So, Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:

Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's find out how many boys there are:

Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout:

Fraction of girls in the girl scout = 2/3

Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 * (2/3) = 80

Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout:

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce. So, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. We do this by dividing the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit, so they didn't have to drive through the traffic jam at all.

The total number of cars originally on the motorway is 30. After the traffic jam, the number of cars that actually drove through the jam is \( x + 20 - 5 \) (since 5 cars didn't drive through).

So, the equation representing the total number of cars that drove through the jam is:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 - 5 \]
\[ x + 15 = 25 \]
\[ x = 25 - 15 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, 10 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box and then calculate its volume. After that, we can multiply by 3 to get the total volume for all 3 boxes.

Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box will be reduced by 2 inches in each direction (1 inch from each side). So, the inner dimensions of each box will be:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box:

\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- Friday: 2 hours
- Total: 7 hours

- Monday + Tuesday + Thursday + Friday = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 hours

Since the total hours watched is 7, the hours watched on Wednesday would be:

- 7 - 5 = 2 hours

Since each episode of the 30-minute show is 0.5 hours, we can find the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode:

- 2 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 4 episodes

So, Frankie watched 4 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups they ate on average, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the number of fruit roll-ups each person ate to find the total:
- Total number of fruit roll-ups = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total by 2 (since there are two people):
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance she rows in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = \left(\frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the rate at which water enters the boat, which is 2 liters for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water enters the boat over 80 feet, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). Therefore, we have \( 300 = 50D \).
4. To find \( D \), we solve the equation \( 300 = 50D \) by dividing both sides by 50: \( D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6.

The final numerical answer is:
6"
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought:

1. Cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
   - She bought ten of these boards at $10 each.
   - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 * $10 = $100.

2. Cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
   - She bought five of these boards at $16 each.
   - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 * $16 = $80.

3. Total cost of all the lumber:
   - Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

1. Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
   - She sells all ten boards.
   - Since the price has increased by 50%, the new price is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
   - Total revenue for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 * $15 = $150.

2. Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
   - She sells all five boards.
   - Since the price has increased by 50%, the new price is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.
   - Total revenue for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 * $24 = $120.

3. Total revenue from selling all the lumber:
   - Total revenue = $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:

- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $270 - $180 = $90.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $90."
"The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the mixture are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water combined. Since the total parts are 20, each part is equal to 120 / 20 = 6 teaspoons.

Since the sugar makes up 7 parts of the mixture, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons.

42 teaspoons"
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

1. First, find the total number of pairs of shoes: \(2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs}\).
2. Then, calculate the total cost: \(6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360\).

Therefore, John paid $360."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles (total on the second day) - 10 vehicles (from the first day) = 20 vehicles (added on the second day)

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.

4 containers"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. So, his new salary is:
   \[
   40,000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000
   \]
3. Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary four years ago was \( L \), then:
   \[
   40,000 = L \times (1 + 0.30) = L \times 1.30
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23
   \]
4. Four years later, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, her new salary is:
   \[
   30,769.23 \times (1 + 0.40) = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.94
   \]
5. The total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[
   56,000 + 43,076.94 = 99,076.94
   \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.94."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper. 

So, in a week, he uses:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, he uses:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is:
2 * 5 = 10 apples

Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is:
8 / 2 = 4 oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits they have:

Morisette's fruits: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael's fruits: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

Total fruits: 13 + 14 = 27 fruits

They have a total of 27 fruits."
"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so:
- Tuesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours
- Wednesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so:
- Thursday: 6 + 1 = 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours she slept throughout the week:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 46 hours

So, Sadie slept a total of 46 hours throughout the week."
"Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, which means she covers:

\[ 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the initial 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. Since the total time is 7 hours, the remaining time is:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

In the remaining 4 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour, so she covers:

\[ 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the two distances together, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

\[ 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours."
"Jennie put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. 

One-third of 60 is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

So, Jennie added 20 stamps to the pile of letters already needing stamps. 

If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, and she added 20 stamps to the pile, then the number of letters that were already stamped before she added the 20 is:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (since her husband gave her 5 spoons).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

Final numerical answer:

38 + 44 = 82

Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages."
"Lily made 50 friends. Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Together, Lily and Amy have 50 + 70 = 120 friends."
"Given that each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of the other items based on this information.

1. The cost of a watermelon is three times the cost of a pepper:
   \[ \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

2. The cost of an orange is 5 less than the cost of a watermelon:
   \[ \text{Cost of an orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- 4 watermelons at $45 each:
  \[ 4 \times 45 = 180 \]

- 20 peppers at $15 each:
  \[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

- 10 oranges at $40 each:
  \[ 10 \times 40 = 400 \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \]

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $880."
"To calculate the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent by doctors with patients in a day.
2. Calculate the total revenue from patients.
3. Calculate the total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Total time spent by doctors with patients in a day:
   - Number of patients per day: 500
   - Average time per patient: 24 minutes
   - Total time in minutes: \(500 \times 24 = 12000\) minutes
   - Convert minutes to hours: \(12000 \div 60 = 200\) hours

2. Total revenue from patients:
   - Charge per hour from patients: $200
   - Total revenue: \(200 \times 200 = 40000\) dollars

3. Total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time:
   - Charge per hour to the hospital: $150
   - Total cost: \(150 \times 200 = 30000\) dollars

4. Calculate the profit:
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = \(40000 - 30000 = 10000\) dollars

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Nissa initially hires 60 elves.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. So, we calculate a third of 60:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   This means 20 elves quit, leaving:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Therefore, the final number of elves left is 30."
"Joseph's expenditure in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less, so his expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $440.

Together, they rode a total of 4 + 6 = 10 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets they used is 10 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 60 tickets.

60 tickets"
"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. 

To find out how much he pays in a year, we first calculate the monthly cost and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Monthly cost = 4 car washes * $15 per car wash = $60
Yearly cost = $60 per month * 12 months = $720

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games right before the comparison was made.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has and then subtract 5.

3 * 15 = 45

Now, subtract 5 from 45:

45 - 5 = 40

Bobby has 40 video games.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic.

Given:
- Total cars = 20
- Automatic cars = 12
- Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 12 - 4
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. B = 2Q (there are twice as many baby bees as queens)
2. W = 2B (there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
3. The total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700

Using the first relationship, we can express B in terms of Q: B = 2Q.

Using the second relationship, we can express W in terms of B: W = 2B. Since B = 2Q, we can substitute to get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

Now we can substitute W and B in terms of Q into the total number of bees equation:
4Q + 2Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700
Q = 100

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W:
B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200
W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items:

- Milk is a food item, so its cost is $2.
- Eggs are a food item, so its cost is $3.
- Light bulbs are non-food items, so its cost is $3.
- Cups are non-food items, so its cost is $3.
- Roach traps are non-food items, so its cost is $4.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the non-food items before tax:

$3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $10

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:

10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the non-food items:

$10 (non-food items) + $1 (tax) = $11

Now, let's add the cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items with tax:

$2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) + $11 (non-food items with tax) = $16

So, the total cost of everything is $16."
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- He already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 2 bottles of bleach is \(2 \times \$2 = \$4\).
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is \$5.
- Therefore, the total cost per client is \( \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \).

Now, we can calculate the total expenses for all 8 clients:

- The total cost for 8 clients is \(8 \times \$9 = \$72\).

Kim's total income each week is given as $92.

Finally, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income:

- Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
- Profit = \$92 - \$72 = \$20

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is $20."

Johnny picks up 2125 Lego pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the second 6 hours return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees did not return in the second 6 hours. So, 15 bees return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 15."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. So, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$12 = \$22 \]

If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, it means she gave more than the total cost of the tickets. To find out how much she gave, we add the change to the total cost:

\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change} = \$22 + \$8 = \$30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up some equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so Charlie has \( 3D \) friends.
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so James has \( 4D \) friends.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so \( 3D = 12 \).

Now, we can solve for \( D \):
\[ 3D = 12 \]
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends, we can find out how many friends James has:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes
- Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

The difference in time between the winner (Steve) and the loser (Tim) is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

2. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).

3. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

5. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( x - 30 \), which is \( \frac{x - 30}{3} \).

6. Ants carried off the final fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the remaining fries are \( \frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

Now, we can set up the equation and solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5
\]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[
x - 30 = 18
\]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[
x = 48
\]

So, the initial number of fries in the pack was \( 48 \).

\[
\boxed{48}

"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we can break it down by the days of the week and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour. So, for each of these 3 days, he spends:
\[ 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total for these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours. So, for each of these 2 days, he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total for these days is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Adding the hours from both sets of days gives the total hours per week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total hours for the semester is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, Kimo spends a total of 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we need to calculate the length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum these lengths.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Number of rolls: 300
   - Length of each roll: 4 inches
   - Total length of rolls: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Number of croissants: 120
   - Length of each croissant: 6 inches
   - Total length of croissants: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Number of baguettes: 60
   - Length of each baguette: 2 feet (which is 24 inches)
   - Total length of baguettes: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches

Now, we sum the total lengths in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[3360 \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to first determine the monthly consumption of bananas by all the apes and then multiply that by 2.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is:
200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

For 2 months, the total number of bananas needed is:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance each person runs.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each back-and-forth run is 200 yards (100 yards to the other end and 100 yards back). So, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth once on a 100-yard field, which is 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, which is 80 yards each time (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back). So, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 200 + 34 \times 80 = 200 + 2720 = 2920 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2920 yards. The difference is:
\[ 3000 - 2920 = 80 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 80 yards farther than the loser."
"To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the pens, notebooks, and bond paper he bought.

1. Cost of pens: 4 pens * $1.5 each = $6
2. Cost of notebooks: 2 notebooks * $4 each = $8
3. Cost of bond paper: $20

Now, we add up all these costs:

Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper
Total cost = $6 + $8 + $20
Total cost = $34

Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"Finn initially watches 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them come out from under a lily pad, and 2 of them hide under a rock. 

So, the number of tadpoles he can see now is the initial number minus the ones that hid plus the ones that came out:

11 (initial) - 2 (hid under a rock) + 6 (came out from under a lily pad) = 15 tadpoles.

Finn can now see 15 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth is:
17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth is:
(2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."

- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught:

Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish

Combined total: 19 + 13 = 32 fish

"To find the final cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

1. The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.
2. The price increases by 20% every two months. So, the price after every two months can be calculated as the original price plus 20% of the original price.

Let's denote the original price as \( P_0 = 20 \) dollars.

After 2 months, the price \( P_2 \) will be:
\[ P_2 = P_0 + 0.20 \times P_0 = 20 + 0.20 \times 20 = 20 + 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

After 4 months, the price \( P_4 \) will be:
\[ P_4 = P_2 + 0.20 \times P_2 = 24 + 0.20 \times 24 = 24 + 4.80 = 28.80 \text{ dollars} \]

After 6 months, the price \( P_6 \) will be:
\[ P_6 = P_4 + 0.20 \times P_4 = 28.80 + 0.20 \times 28.80 = 28.80 + 5.76 = 34.56 \text{ dollars} \]

We can see a pattern here. The price after \( 2n \) months can be expressed as:
\[ P_{2n} = P_0 \times (1 + 0.20)^n \]

Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we can substitute \( n = 18 \) into the formula:
\[ P_{36} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the price after 36 months is:
\[ P_{36} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the final cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ \boxed{787.32} \]"
"Given:
- 5 red cars
- 3 action figures
- 1 doll

The cost of one red car is $4.
The cost of one action figure is $5.
The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, let's calculate the cost of the doll:
- Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- The total cost of the red cars: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.
- The total cost of the action figures: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- The cost of the doll: 15 dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost of all the toys is:
\[20 + 15 + 15 = 50\]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is:
50"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. The accountant charges $90.
2. If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work at $35 per hour.

First, calculate the lost income:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Now, compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income:
\[ \text{Lost income} - \text{Accountant's fee} = \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, Jackie will have \$15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer and its accessories and then subtract that from her budget.

The cost of the computer is €1090.
The cost of the screen is €157.
The cost of the keyboard and mouse is €74.
The cost of the CD burner is €74.
The cost of the printer is €102.

First, we add up the costs of all the items:

\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 74 + 102 = 1497 \]

Elvira's budget is €1500. So, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:

\[ 1500 - 1497 = 3 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is €3."
"To make 15 Spanish flans, Sandra needs 3 eggs per flan. So, the total number of eggs required is:

15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

45 eggs / 9 eggs/babysitting = 5 babysitting sessions

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B \]
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old."
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, then:

Twice the money Ethel has is 2 * $8 = $16.

So, Jimmy has $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the total miles he walks on the weekend is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend gives:

\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week."
"The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so:
\[ \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
\[ \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

Each uniform costs a total of $150."

The total age of the four birds is 41."
"To calculate how much Jessica pays in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts each month, we first need to determine the increased monthly payment for each debt.

1. **Student Loans:**
   - Minimum payment: $300/month
   - 50% more: $300 * 1.5 = $450/month

2. **Credit Card:**
   - Minimum payment: $200/month
   - 50% more: $200 * 1.5 = $300/month

3. **Mortgage:**
   - Minimum payment: $500/month
   - 50% more: $500 * 1.5 = $750/month

Next, we add up the increased monthly payments for all debts:
- Total monthly payment: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500/month

Finally, to find the total amount Jessica pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:
- Total annual payment: $1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, it will take \( 60 \times 1.5 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, it will take \( 60 \times 5 \) seconds.

Now, let's convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- \( 60 \times 5 \) seconds is equal to \( 300 \) seconds.
- Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, \( 300 \) seconds is equal to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) minutes.

Now, let's add the time for peeling and cutting:
- Time to peel: \( 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \) minutes.
- Time to cut: \( 5 \) minutes.
- Total time: \( 90 + 5 = 95 \) minutes.

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"Given that Jan is 30 years old, we can use the information provided to find Mark's age and then Jean's age.

First, let's find Mark's age two years ago. We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

Jan's age two years ago was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years.

So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

Mark's current age = 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's current age:

Jean's age = 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner completes the 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner completes the 400 meters in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner completes the 400 meters in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 seconds + 57 seconds + 54 seconds + 51 seconds = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's total time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's total time is 222 seconds.
The difference in time = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then expressing that difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[ \frac{0.25}{0.25} \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

4. A total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters).

First, we need to find out how many pieces of straw were used for the hamsters and the rabbits:

- For the hamsters: \(10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces}\)
- For the rabbits: \(20 \text{ pieces}\)

So, the total pieces of straw used for the hamsters and rabbits is \(50 + 20 = 70 \text{ pieces}\).

Since the total straw distributed is 160 pieces, the straw used for the rats is \(160 - 70 = 90 \text{ pieces}\).

Now, we know that each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, and there are 3 cages with equal numbers of rats. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \(r\). Therefore, the total number of rats is \(3r\), and the total straw used for the rats is \(3r \times 6 = 18r\).

We know that \(18r = 90\), so we can solve for \(r\):

\[18r = 90\]
\[r = \frac{90}{18}\]
\[r = 5\]

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to apply the monthly interest rate of 2% to the initial amount of $100 for each of the 3 months.

Let's break it down month by month:

**Month 1:**
- Initial amount: $100
- Interest for the month: $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total amount after 1 month: $100 + $2 = $102

**Month 2:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $102
- Interest for the month: $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total amount after 2 months: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**Month 3:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $104.04
- Interest for the month: $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total amount after 3 months: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12."
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost to buy each bag is $20, and the cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \]

The trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he collects peaches for a total of 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

"To find out how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
2. Divide the total weekly need by 7 to find the daily need.

Step 1: Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are 10 ducks.
Total weekly need = 3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Step 2: Divide the total weekly need by 7 to find the daily need.
Daily need = 35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net increase in trees per year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.

2. Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the number of trees he would have planted and not chopped down is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.

3. Therefore, the total number of trees after 10 years is \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

4. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

5. The number of trees left after 30% die is \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is 91."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Friday morning, there are 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard.
2. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \) flamingos. These 6 flamingos were then painted white and put back out.
3. After painting, there are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) pink flamingos left and 6 white flamingos.
4. On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \) and the number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos there are than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."

"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - Number of men - Number of women
Number of children = 23786 - 8417 - 9092

Now, let's do the math:

Number of children = 23786 - 8417 - 9092
Number of children = 15369 - 9092
Number of children = 6277

So, there are 6277 children in the city of Soda."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40
- Cards after the third month: 200

Total cards = Initial cards + Cards after the first month + Cards after the second month + Cards after the third month
Total cards = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200
Total cards = 320

"Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, he earns:
5 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays him 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, he earns:
10 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers, Mark makes:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices for sandwiches: \(7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices for omelets: \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**

"To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93, we need to consider that she can remove her lowest score from the five tests she has already taken. Let's first identify her lowest score among the first five tests:

- 89
- 71
- 92
- 100
- 86

The lowest score is 71. We will remove this score and calculate the average of the remaining four scores plus the sixth test score, aiming for an average of 93.

The sum of the four highest scores is:
89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Let \( x \) be the score Brinley needs on the sixth test. The average of the four highest scores plus the sixth test score, after removing the lowest score, should be 93. The equation for the average is:

\[
\frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

\[
367 + x = 465
\]

Then, we subtract 367 from both sides:

\[
x = 465 - 367
\]

\[
x = 98
\]

So, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to get an average of 93."
"Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time for 4 weeks. So, the total distance for the first period is:

\[ 5 \text{ times/week} \times 25 \text{ km/time} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Then, he changed his routine and rode 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time for 3 weeks. So, the total distance for the second period is:

\[ 2 \text{ times/week} \times 60 \text{ km/time} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Adding the distances from both periods gives the total distance:

Therefore, the total distance Micheal did is 860 kilometers."
"Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 20g.

Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups would be \(240\) cups (since one dozen is 12).
   - Let the cost of one cup be \(x\).
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(240x\).

3. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, we can write the equation as:
     \[
     240x = 36000 - 1200
     \]

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     240x = 34800
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 240 to find \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{34800}{240} = 145
     \]

Therefore, the cost of each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the jacket is $30.
The cost of 2 pairs of shoes is 2 * $20 = $40.
So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Sara will earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.
Let's say Sara mows the lawn \( x \) times. She earns $4 each time, so she earns 4x dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money Sara will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn is $10 + $20 + 4x = $30 + 4x.

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes. So, we set up the inequality:
\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the inequality:
\[ 4x \geq 70 - 30 \]
\[ 4x \geq 40 \]
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, which is a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance he walks by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers by the third day.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons and the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( S = 8 \) gallons of water. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

So, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. So, the total amount she promised to return is:

\[ 2000 + (2000 \times 0.10) = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find Janeth's remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:

\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be $220."

"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:

2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, we calculate the points scored by Yuri:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri scored 10 more than this: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Next, we calculate the points scored by Brianna:
- Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
- Total points: 251
- Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)

So, the points scored by Jojo are:

"First, let's calculate the new number of each type of card after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards:

30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 total cards

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.3333... \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:

\[ 33\% \]"
"Let's break down the cost of Chad's burrito order:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
- Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Now, let's add these costs together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract that from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad still owes $9.00."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces per minute.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
3. The number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
4. When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at that time is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
5. The number of watermelons remaining after she harvested the 63 ready ones is:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = $20,000 * 12 = $240,000.

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Tax on the cars = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

3. **Registration fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total registration fees = $1,000 * 12 = $12,000.

4. **Total amount paid:**
   - Total amount = Cost of the cars + Tax on the cars + Registration fees
   - Total amount = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, she collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

"There are 36 penguins sunbathing initially.

One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean:
36 / 3 = 12 penguins

Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner:
36 / 3 = 12 penguins

To find out how many are still left sunbathing, we subtract the penguins that left from the initial number:
36 - 12 - 12 = 12 penguins

Final numerical answer:
12 penguins are still left sunbathing."
"Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 cherry tomatoes per day.

Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 cherry tomatoes per day.

In a week, they eat 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 cherry tomatoes.

If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, then the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough cherry tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend.

"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
- There are 20 friends, and each friend wants 4 slices.
- Total slices needed = 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

Step 2: Determine how many pizzas are required.
- Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.
- Number of pizzas needed = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza = 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. He uses these 25 pens, which means he now has 25 empty pens.
3. He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, with 25 empty pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new full pens.
4. After making these 5 new pens, he now has 5 empty pens from the new pens and no empty pens from the original 25 pens that were used up. So, he has 5 empty pens in total.
5. He can again mix the ink from these 5 empty pens to make 1 more full pen.
6. After making this pen, he now has 1 empty pen from the new pen and no empty pens from the previous 5 pens that were used up. So, he has 1 empty pen in total.
7. He cannot make any more pens because he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen, and he only has 1 empty pen.

So, the total number of pens he has is the original 25 pens plus the 5 pens he made from the first mixing plus the 1 pen he made from the second mixing. This gives us \( 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 \) pens.

The final numerical answer is:

20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68.

The final numerical answer is 68."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of the students went out through exit A.
   - 30% of 1000 = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students.

2. The number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:
   - 1000 - 300 = 700 students.

3. 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B.
   - 3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

4. The number of students who went out through exit C is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B:
   - 700 - 420 = 280 students.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. So we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
\[ J = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

"Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If they read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider that each person will read all 3 books.

So, Dolly will read 3 books (her 2 books + Pandora's 1 book) and Pandora will also read 3 books (her 1 book + Dolly's 2 books).

However, since they are reading the same books, we don't double count. They will collectively read 3 books in total.

Collectively, they will read 3 books by the end."
"Mike was originally a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with 3 people.

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, Mike receives \(3 \times 2 \times 5 = 30\) pages of letters a week.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages of letters a week.

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[
\frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}

So, the total minutes used this month is:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (extra calls) = 750 minutes

Subtracting the total minutes used from the monthly plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

1. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and it takes 6 hours each day.
   \[
   \text{Daily cost} = 250 \times 6 = 1500 \text{ dollars}

"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

So, in total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

The difference in calories consumed is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. Each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so there are \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) boys and \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) girls in total.

Now, let's look at the girls in each class:
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.

So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is \(15 + 12 = 27\).

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is \(30 - 27 = 3\).

Since each class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is \(20 - 3 = 17\).

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the initial number of cows in the ten stalls. Since each of the ten stalls has 20 cows, the total number of cows is:

"Each 10-foot section of the redwood weighs 400 pounds. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, it has 20 sections (200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections).

The total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any part of it would be:
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds.

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 30% of 8000 pounds is:
0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds.

The remaining weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten is:
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds."

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
4. Andrea has 52 apples.

From point 1, we can write:
\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]
Since Andrea has 52 apples:
\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

From point 3, we know:

"To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. Calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times \$350,000 = 0.05 \times \$350,000 = \$17,500 \]

2. Calculate the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \times \$350,000 = 0.12 \times \$350,000 = \$42,000 \]

3. Calculate the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = \$350,000 + \$17,500 + \$42,000 = \$409,500 \]

4. Calculate how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = \$409,500 - \$400,000 = \$9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. Calculate the transfer fees:
   Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000
   Transfer fees = $12,000

2. Calculate the brokerage fee:
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
   Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $400,000
   Brokerage fee = $20,000

3. Calculate the total fees and loan amount to be subtracted:
   Total fees and loan = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
   Total fees and loan = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000
   Total fees and loan = $282,000

4. Calculate the net proceeds:
   Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees and loan
   Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000
   Net proceeds = $118,000

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time it took to heat it to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - So, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:** 
   - Time to heat to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
   - Time to heat to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
   - Time to cook chicken: 23 minutes
   - Total time: \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 71 minutes."
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for newspaper ads is \( 5 \times 50 = 250 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.
- Therefore, the total cost for television ads is \( 75 \times 15 = 1125 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost for newspaper ads + Cost for television ads
- Total cost = \( 250 + 1125 = 1375 \) dollars.

The real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

"The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has:
300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has:
300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

To find the total number of M&Ms, we add the M&Ms from all three bags:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms.

Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

First, we calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- So, the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses is:
- \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

Next, we calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
- There are 4 additional windows in each house.
- So, the total number of additional windows for both houses is:
- \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Finally, we add the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
- \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find out how much change the cashier gives back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought. 

The cost of cocoa is $4.20, the cost of laundry is $9.45, and the cost of the package of pasta is $1.35. Adding these amounts together:

$4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

$20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves:
\[ 1800 \text{ (total stitches)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, and rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches per sleeve} \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- Number of tomato seed packets: 20
- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40
- Total cost for tomato seeds: 20 * $40 = $800

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30
- Total cost for celery seeds: 80 * $30 = $2400

Now, we add the total costs for both types of seeds:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total cost for all seeds: $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Lyrics to the solo song**: 54 lines.

2. **First scene**:
   - Total lines: Twice the number of lines in the solo song, so \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Sean's lines: A third of the total lines, so \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines.

3. **Second scene**:
   - Total lines: Six more lines than the solo song, so \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Sean's lines: Four-fifths of the total lines, so \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines.

Now, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:

- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40.

Final numerical answer:
40"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Final answer: Sam is 6 years old."

"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and has twice as many spots as a mamba, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we add the total number of spots for the cobras and the mambas to find the combined total number of spots:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, we find half of the combined total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, half the number of spots they all have combined is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
- There are also 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are needed. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, if each pizza costs $15, then the total cost for 13 pizzas is:

13 * $15 = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. So, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
   \[
   8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length occupied by the topaz gemstones, the length occupied by the sterling silver beads is:
   \[
   25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we divide the length occupied by the beads by the length of each bead:
   \[
   \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads}

"To find the number of 5-star rows on the flag, let's first calculate the total number of stars used in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

3 rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
2 rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of stars used in these rows:
\(24 + 12 = 36\) stars

The flag has a total of 76 stars, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
\(76 - 36 = 40\) stars

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of stars in these rows by 5:
\(40 \div 5 = 8\) rows

"After 3 rounds, the points are as follows:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which is 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So:
- Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points after the extra points are distributed are:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 5 members in the household.
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person/meal} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
Assuming each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, the household consumes rice twice a day.
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
There are 7 days in a week.
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To create a 32-page tabloid, you would need 16 pieces of paper. 

Here's the reasoning:

- Each sheet of paper, when folded in half, can print 4 pages: 2 on the front and 2 on the back.
- For a 32-page tabloid, you would need 32 / 4 = 8 sheets of paper.

However, since each sheet of paper is folded in half, you only need half the number of sheets to get the total number of pages. Therefore, for 32 pages, you would need 16 pieces of paper."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise started with 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total number of books sold is the sum of the books sold in the first, second, and third years, which is \(90 + \text{second year sales} + 45 = 200\).

From this, we can find the number of books sold in the second year:
\[90 + \text{second year sales} + 45 = 200\]
\[135 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 200 - 135\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 65\]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is $1300."
"Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works 50 hours a week. He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

50 hours * $10/hour = $500

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total weekly earnings including the bonus are:

$500 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800

April typically has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:

$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them.

First, we calculate how many people he beat:
80% of 20 = 0.80 * 20 = 16 people

"The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
Two-thirds of 60 loaves are sold in the morning:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. This leaves:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening. Half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds (since 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds).

The final numerical answer is:
8 pounds"

"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the family of 5, 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
2. The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

First, calculate the daily egg consumption for the 3 people:
3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs

Next, calculate the daily egg consumption for the 2 people:
2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs

Now, add the two amounts to get the total daily egg consumption:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Since they eat eggs every day, we need to find out how many eggs they consume in a week (7 days):
13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.
4. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, which means the population was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

Now, we need to find the current population of Chile. The problem states that the population six years ago was half of what it is now. Therefore, the current population is twice the population six years ago.

So, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

Combining like terms again, we get:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \), we divide both sides by 7:

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, to find out how many people showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\(24 - 10 = 14\)

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14."

\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} \).
7. Therefore, \( P = 15 \).

The total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 is 10 people.

This means that 30 people stayed at the party (40 - 10 = 30).

We are told that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were originally 25 men, the number of men who left is 3 (25 - 22 = 3).

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 must have been women (10 - 3 = 7).

Therefore, the number of women who left is 7.

Originally, there were 15 women, so the number of women left at the party is 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to determine the total number of pencils they have together.

Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up the equation for Jam's pencils as follows:

\[ 3 \times \text{(number of pencils per box)} + 2 = 26 \]

Let's solve for the number of pencils per box:

\[ 3 \times \text{(number of pencils per box)} = 24 \]
\[ \text{(number of pencils per box)} = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we know that Jam has 26 pencils in total, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils they have together is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils if each box can hold 8 pencils. We divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the number of ice cubes added and then use that to find the total weakening effect from the ice cubes and the cream.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes added:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   \[
   \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect from the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   \[
   \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect from the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.
   \[
   \text{Weakening from cream} = 15 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   \[
   \text{Total weakening} = \text{Weakening from ice cubes} + \text{Weakening from cream} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Since the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Now, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to all junior programmers per month is:

Total payment to junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000

Next, we need to find the number of senior programmers. Since the total number of employees is 100 and there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:

Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly salary is:

Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

The total amount paid to all senior programmers per month is:

Total payment to senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000

Finally, to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the total payments to junior and senior programmers:

Total payment to all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224,000."
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. 

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, to find out how long it will take to recharge 40 percentage points, we multiply 40 by 3 minutes:

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 / 60 = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

$80 / $20 = 4

So, they earned $4 in rewards.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their $4 reward. However, they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. 

Twice the reward amount is:
2 * $4 = $8

So, the total discount applied is the reward plus the coupon discount:

$43 - $12 = $31

Therefore, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:

1. Annual gross pay for Job A: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
2. Total tax for Job A: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
3. Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:

1. Annual gross pay for Job B: $42,000
2. Property tax for Job B: $6,000
3. Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

"To find the final value of all Maria's shares, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial total cost of the shares.
2. Calculate the value of the shares after the first year.
3. Calculate the value of the shares after the second year.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial total cost of the shares.**

Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the value of the shares after the first year.**

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. So, the new price per share is:
\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

The value of all 8 shares after the first year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the value of the shares after the second year.**

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. So, the new price per share is:
\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

The value of all 8 shares after the second year is:

"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can write these as equations:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:
\[ 4C + 2H = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have is:

"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling with:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (balls added each week for 4 weeks) = 7 balls

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left is:

7 - 3 = 4 balls

But 2 of those balls are caught by people in the crowd, so he still has:

4 - 2 = 2 balls

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 2 balls.

2 balls"
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"Jenny's son gets 4 cookies in his lunch box 5 days a week, so that's:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so that's:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband in a week is:
\[ 20 \text{ cookies/week} + 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 27 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Since each bag contains 36 cookies, the number of cookies Jenny eats is:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies/week} - 27 \text{ cookies/week} = 9 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Jenny eats 9 cookies."

"To calculate the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to break down the costs for each item and then sum them up for a year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is \(25 \times 4 = 100\) dollars.
   - For a year, the cost for food is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for treats is \(20 \times 12 = 240\) dollars.

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for medicine is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the yearly costs:
- Yearly cost for food: $1200
- Yearly cost for treats: $240
- Yearly cost for medicine: $1200

Total yearly cost = \(1200 + 240 + 1200 = 2640\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming:

- Boating: 6 hours
- Swimming: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total time John spent watching shows:

- Shows: 3 shows * 2 hours each = 6 hours

Now, we know that the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows (9 + 6 = 15 hours) is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time as \( T \). We can set up the equation:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:

\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \]

So, the total time John spent on vacation is 50 hours.

The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so:
6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so first we find the combined height of the two shorter trees:
6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet

Now, we multiply this combined height by 2 to find the height of the tallest tree:
17 feet * 2 = 34 feet

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall."

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then we'll subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. Cost of one round of mini-golf: $5
2. Cost of go-karts (2 rides): $10 * 2 = $20
3. Arcade tokens: $5

Total cost for Morgan (including herself) is:
$5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $30

Now, subtract this from her budget to find out how much is left for her friends:
$90 (budget) - $30 (Morgan's expenses) = $60

Each friend will need the same amount as Morgan for mini-golf, go-karts, and arcade tokens, which is $30. So, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend:
$60 / $30 = 2

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends to the party.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how much money Billy has left after buying the candy. We know he spent half of his change on gumballs, and he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each.

2. Calculate the cost of 40 gumballs:
   \[
   40 \text{ gumballs} \times \$0.05 \text{ per gumball} = \$2
   \]

3. Since the $2 was half of his change, his total change after buying the candy was:
   \[
   2 \times \$2 = \$4
   \]

4. Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is:
   \[
   \$10 - \$4 = \$6
   \]

5. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy he bought is:
   \[
   \frac{\$6}{\$1.5 \text{ per pound}} = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation:

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days}\]

So, the train goes between services every 20 days."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that many minus 5. So, we calculate:
   \[
   4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]
   Therefore, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters. So, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
   Therefore, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons:
   \[
   3 + 7 + 21 + x = 50

"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount of Saturday, which is:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

"To calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to first determine the total interest she will pay over the five months and then add this to the principal amount. After that, we can divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

1. Calculate the total interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.085 \]

2. Calculate the total amount to be paid:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.085 \]

3. Calculate the monthly payment:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is $760.42.

Monthly Payment: $760.42"
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

The total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make:

- Millie makes 3 pitchers of lemonade.
- Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade.

So, the total amount of lemonade is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade:

- Millie sells each cup for $1.
- She has 36 cups of lemonade.

So, the total revenue is:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the supplies:

- Millie spends $18 on supplies.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to determine how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:
\[ \$2 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, half of the performers can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

So, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

Number of girls who can make it = 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so we add these 3 teachers to the 13 girls:

Total number of people who sang in the performance = 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16

"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:
- The savings for David is \(36 - 30 = $6\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

Adding these together, we get:
6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for these 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the number of gifts:

144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services without the bundle discount:

- Netflix: $10 per month
- Hulu: $10 per month
- Disney Plus: $10 per month

Total cost without bundle discount: $10 + $10 + $10 = $30 per month

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 20% bundle discount:

- The combined cost of Hulu and Disney Plus before the discount is $10 + $10 = $20 per month.
- A 20% discount on $20 is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
- So, the discounted cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16 per month.

Adding the cost of Netflix, the total cost with the bundle discount is:

- $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26 per month

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. So, for 8 hours, it uses:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments for May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for May = 40 × $15 × 40
Total payment for May = $24,000

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = 1/4 × 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for June = 30 × $15 × 40
Total payment for June = $18,000

**Step 4: Sum the payments for May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June
Total payment for May and June = $24,000 + $18,000
Total payment for May and June = $42,000

\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Next, calculate the number of candles that explode:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500 \]

Assuming the defects are independent, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ 2500 \times 0.01 = 25 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

Step 1: Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
The regular price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. So, the discount amount per blouse is:
\[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]
Therefore, the discount price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Step 2: Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses.
Misha picked 4 blouses, so the total cost is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

The total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet. Let's call this number \(x\).

Joanne's total apples: \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

Joanne's sister's total apples: \(60 + 45 = 105\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, we can write the equation:

\[ (45 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

Final numerical answer:
350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( c + d = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2c + d = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( d \) from the first equation:
\[ d = 180 - c \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( d \) into the second equation:
\[ 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \]
\[ 2c + 180 - c = 304 \]
\[ c + 180 = 304 \]
\[ c = 304 - 180 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting \( c \) back into the equation \( d = 180 - c \):
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days, which is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} \times 0.30 = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \, \text{km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Adding all these distances together, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, the total number of kilometers Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches big."
"Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from an elevation of 10,000 feet, so the comb is now at an elevation of:

10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb:

6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the money he received from the banks to his initial capital.

1. The first bank gave him $4000.
2. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is \(2 \times 4000 = 8000\) dollars.
3. His initial capital was $5000.

Now, we add these amounts together:

\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

So, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of $17000.

17000"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so they carried away a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats.

After the boats took away the cats, there were \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats left on the rock.

Then, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

Final answer: 12 cats were left on the rock."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[ 6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48 \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96 \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ \$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256 \]

The total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[ \$256 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The tattered jeans cost $28.
2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.
3. Cole saved a total of $6 on the jeans.
4. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). We know \( T = 28 \) and \( J = 22 \).

The savings on the jogger jeans is \( J - 22 \) and the savings on the tattered jeans is \( T - 28 \).

According to the problem, the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of the total savings, so:
\[ J - 22 = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

This means the original price of the jogger jeans \( J \) is:
\[ J = 22 + 2 = 24 \]

The total savings is $6, and the savings from the tattered jeans is:
\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

So, the original price of the jogger jeans is $24, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference in the original prices is:
\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 more than the tattered jeans.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

1. The 4 buses can each hold 60 employees, so the total capacity for the buses is:
   \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees

2. The 6 minibusses can each hold 30 employees, so the total capacity for the minibusses is:
   \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees

3. The 10 minivans can each hold 15 employees, so the total capacity for the minivans is:
   \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
\(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\)

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Since there are 3 store-bought feeders, they will attract 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

And since there are 3 homemade feeders, they will attract 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Therefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds."
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, the cost of the cake is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[
5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy a ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \) dollars.
- After buying the ticket, he has $50 left, so the money he has after buying the ticket is \( x - 100 \) dollars.
- This remaining money is equal to the $50 he has in spending cash, so we can write the equation:
  \[
  x - 100 = 50
  \]
- Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 150
  \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{150}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially told to prepare enough hot dogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hot dogs. This means 18 guests would get two hot dogs, and the other 18 would get one hot dog.

2. The total number of hot dogs prepared would be:
   - 18 guests * 2 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs
   - 18 guests * 1 hot dog = 18 hot dogs
   - Total = 36 + 18 = 54 hot dogs

3. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the first hot dog for each of the 40 guests was provided, and now they all want a second one.

4. Since there were only 54 hot dogs prepared, and 40 guests each wanted a second hot dog, we need to see how many of those second hot dogs can be provided:
   - 54 hot dogs - 40 hot dogs (first hot dog for each guest) = 14 hot dogs left for seconds

5. Since 40 guests wanted a second hot dog and only 14 were available, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:
   - 40 guests - 14 hot dogs = 26 guests

Final numerical answer:
26 guests did not get a second hot dog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the cost of the pot and pans: $120.00
2. Calculate the cost of the mixing bowls: $20.00
3. Calculate the cost of the 5 separate utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, calculate the 20% discount on the total cost:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, the total cost is:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Dora has $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16, so the total amount of money Dora has is:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. George spent $5 in total.
2. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each.
3. He had 1% of his money left after the purchase.

First, calculate the total cost of the 3 bags of chips:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much money George had left after the purchase. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can calculate the remaining amount:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ dollars} = 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can determine how much money George spent on candy bars by subtracting the cost of the chips and the remaining money from the total amount he spent:
\[ 5 - 1.20 - 0.05 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars George bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ \frac{3.75 \text{ dollars}}{0.75 \text{ dollars per candy bar}} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:

56 oranges ÷ 8 people = 7 oranges per person.

Each person will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. So, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost for the onions will be:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the cost for the beef stock will be:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth has:

- 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 red beads
- 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 clear beads

So, Elizabeth has a total of 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Therefore, Margareth has:

- 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 blue beads
- 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 red beads

So, Margareth has a total of 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller total from the larger total:

140 beads (Margareth) - 60 beads (Elizabeth) = 80 beads

One sister has 80 more beads than the other.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.
2. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.

So, the temperature increase from baking is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Adding this to the initial temperature:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. Marcus then opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

The cooling effect over 30 minutes is:
30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3
3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

Therefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so:

- Swim time for James = 40 minutes * (1 - 0.10) = 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

- Bike time for James = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Let's denote the time James took for the run as \( R \) minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

- Total time for James = 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we can set up the equation for James's total time:

\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):

\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

Final numerical answer:

"Movie C was 1.25 hours long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60:

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

30 minutes is half an hour, so the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money Michael has:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs equal 48 eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, she has a total of 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the total number of glasses of eggnog she can make is 50 eggs divided by 5 eggs per glass, which equals 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is the total number of glasses divided by the number of glasses per tray. So, 10 glasses divided by 5 glasses per tray equals 2 trays.

Final numerical answer:
2 trays"

Let's start with the cost per sneaker:

1. The cost per sneaker = Total cost / Number of sneakers
   = $576 / 48
   = $12

2. The total revenue from the flash sale:
   = Number of sneakers sold at the flash sale * Price per sneaker
   = 17 * $20
   = $340

3. The number of sneakers sold to the department store:
   = Total number of sneakers - Number of sneakers sold at the flash sale
   = 48 - 17
   = 31

4. The total revenue from the department store:
   = Number of sneakers sold to the department store * Price per sneaker
   = 31 * $25
   = $775

5. The total revenue:
   = Revenue from the flash sale + Revenue from the department store
   = $340 + $775
   = $1115

6. The profit:
   = Total revenue - Total cost
   = $1115 - $576
   = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in each type of packet and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of crayons in the six packets that each contain eight pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ crayons/packet} = 48 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets that each contain sixteen pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ crayons/packet} = 64 \text{ crayons} \]

Now, we add the two quantities together to find the total number of crayons:
\[ 48 \text{ crayons} + 64 \text{ crayons} = 112 \text{ crayons} \]

Therefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Super ticket: $20 + $1 for popcorn and soda = $21 total.
2. Regular ticket: $12 + cost of popcorn + $3 for soda.
3. You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The total cost with the regular ticket and the given prices would be:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the regular ticket and the popcorn and soda should be $2 more than the super ticket:
\[ 15 + P = 21 + 2 \]
\[ 15 + P = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $8.

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day.
2. Calculate the new cost of filling one helium balloon after the price increase.
3. Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.

**Step 1: Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day.**

The total cost of filling 20 helium balloons on the first day was $900. Therefore, the cost of filling one balloon is:
\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the new cost of filling one helium balloon after the price increase.**

The cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.**

The total cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find the car's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

1. For the first part of the trip:
   - Speed = 60 mph
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. For the second part of the trip:
   - Speed = 30 mph
   - Time = 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

3. Total distance traveled = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

4. Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

5. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know there are 15 red cards.
2. The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. So, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15:
   \[
   15 \times 0.60 = 9
   \]
   \[
   15 + 9 = 24
   \]
   So, there are 24 green cards.
3. The number of yellow cards is the sum of the red and green cards:
   \[
   15 + 24 = 39
   \]
   So, there are 39 yellow cards.
4. To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:
   \[
   15 + 24 + 39 = 78
   \]

Therefore, the total number of cards is 78."
"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.

After twenty minutes, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw came from the east. Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there.

So, the total number of fairies became:
50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75 fairies.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is:
75 (total fairies) - 30 (fairies that flew away) = 45 fairies.

"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) + 48 (carrots) + 2 (sugar cubes) = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip would still require a full trip to transport the remaining feed).

- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"Grayson recycles 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles each week.

For the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents/week (from cans) + 15 cents/week (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

For a four-week month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 60\% \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

3. She moved ahead 2 spots: \(100 - 2 = 98\). So, she is now in 98th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(98 - 3 = 95\). So, she is now in 95th place.
5. She jumped ahead 1 spot: \(95 + 1 = 96\). So, she is now in 96th place.

Therefore, Finley finished in 96th place."
"Miss Maria has 6 decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck, so she has a total of:

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

First, let's define the sets:
- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)
- Total number of kids in the class, \( |U| = 32 \)

We need to find the number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the substances, which is \( |D \cup P| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances.

To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = |U| - |D \cup P| \]
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

3. Uncle Ben has four horses, so the total consumption per day is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).
4. For five days, the total consumption is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).
5. Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"Jana has 27 puppies. Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.

First, we calculate the number of Pomeranians:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18 \]

One third of the Pomeranians are girls.

Now, we calculate the number of girl Pomeranians:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \]

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."
"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add the highest temperatures of the three countries.
2. Divide the sum by the number of countries (which is 3).

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48°F
- Northlandia: 21°F
- Midlandia: -3°F

First, we add these temperatures together:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -30

Next, we divide the sum by the number of countries:
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of these three countries is -10°F."
"The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is:

$12 - $4 = $8

If he saves $2 daily, the number of days it will take him to save the remaining $8 is:

$8 ÷ $2/day = 4 days

It will take him 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"Jaime has 64 eggs and 2 trays that can each hold 24 eggs. 

First, calculate the total capacity of the 2 trays:
2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Now, subtract the total capacity of the trays from the number of eggs Jaime has:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray."
"Sally buys one small pizza for $8 and one family-size pizza that costs 3 times as much as the small pizza.

First, calculate the cost of the family-size pizza:
3 * $8 = $24

Now, add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:
$8 + $24 = $32

Sally spends a total of $32."
"To find the cost per razor after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Heather is buying 2 packs.
   - Total cost before discounts: \(2 \times \$4.00 = \$8.00\).

2. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale:**
   - Since the offer is ""buy one get one free,"" Heather only pays for one pack and gets the second one free.
   - Cost after the sale: \$4.00 (for the first pack).

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon from the sale price.
   - Cost after the coupon: \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00.

4. **Calculate the cost per razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors: \(2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors/pack} = 8 \text{ razors}\).
   - Cost per razor: \(\frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}\).

5. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - \$0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor, in cents, after the discount is 25 cents."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to identify the height of the shortest cheerleader, as she will be at the top of the pyramid.

Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall, the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The height of the human pyramid will be the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours each day. So, each day she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14, Angela will be \(3 \times 14 = 42\) years old in four years.
4. If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, then her current age is \(42 - 4 = 38\) years old.

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela is 38 years old.**"
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

Each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2.

For the morning rides, he spends:
14 days * $6/ride = $84

For the afternoon rides, he spends:
14 days * $2/ride = $28

The total amount of money he spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
$84 + $28 = $112

Therefore, Paul spent $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so Ashley brought a total of \(5 \times 10 = 50\) oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought \(50 + 20 = 70\) oranges.

Together, Ashley and Brianne brought \(50 + 70 = 120\) oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is \(120 \div 3 = 40\).

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 for each guest for food. So, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per person, and food is already included. So, the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects David found as \( D \), the number of insects Bodhi found as \( B \), and the number of insects Lily found as \( L \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, we substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \( D = 9 \), we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \( 16 \) insects.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. 

First, we need to find out how many yards each used:

- Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \) yards.
- Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \) yards.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma:

- Total yards used = \( 91 + 182 = 273 \) yards.

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."

"The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide. So, the width of the rug is:

3 feet (width of the chair) + 5 feet = 8 feet (width of the rug)

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we calculate twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:

2 * 8 feet (width of the rug) + 2 feet = 16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of those packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which cost $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which cost half as much as the grape gum, so it cost $1.
5. The total cost of all the gum is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and it costs $4.

Given that Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

Therefore, the total number of popsicle sticks he can make is:

"To determine the cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
Mario has 6 sled dogs, and each dog has 4 legs.
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2.
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

"Janet takes two bus trips each day, five days a week. So, the total number of trips she makes in a week is:

2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

If each bus trip costs her $2.20, then the total cost for her bus trips in a week would be:

10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the amount she would save is the difference between the cost of individual trips and the cost of the weekly pass:

$22.00/week - $20.00/week = $2.00/week

Final numerical answer:
$2.00"
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. 

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, but the farm does not have any cows, so this statement is irrelevant to the number of animals on the farm.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, but the farm does not have any sheep, so this statement is also irrelevant to the number of animals on the farm.

So, the farm has 30 cows and 0 sheep, and the zoo has 20 sheep and an unknown number of cows. 

To find the total number of animals, we add the number of cows and sheep on both the farm and the zoo:

30 cows (farm) + 0 sheep (farm) + 0 cows (zoo) + 20 sheep (zoo) = 50 animals

The farm and zoo have a combined total of 50 animals."
"Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. If Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can determine how many Sophia bought by dividing these numbers by 4.

For onions:
12 onions / 4 = 3 onions

For potatoes:
4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
2. Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.

Step 1: Total calories to burn
Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb. Therefore, the total calories to burn is:
\[ 30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 2: Number of days
Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to the 19th): 19 days

Adding these up:
\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

Step 3: Daily calorie deficit
To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories to burn by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105,000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah will need to drink, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Hannah will run.
2. Determine the total amount of water she needs based on the distance.

First, we calculate the total distance:
- Hannah runs 8 laps.
- Each lap is 0.25 km.

Total distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Next, we calculate the total amount of water:
- Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.
- She runs a total of 2 km.

Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"Julie initially had $500.

First, she spent 20% of it on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

So, after buying clothes, she had:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

So, after buying CDs, she had:
$400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie had $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has:

- Ali has four $10 bills, so the total from the $10 bills is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali has six $20 bills, so the total from the $20 bills is \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total amount of money Ali has is \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars.

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister:

- Half of $160 is \(\frac{160}{2} = 80\) dollars.

So, after giving half to his sister, Ali has \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars left.

Then, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner:

- \(\frac{3}{5}\) of $80 is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48\) dollars.

So, after buying dinner, Ali has \(80 - 48 = 32\) dollars left.

The amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"If Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house, that's equivalent to 120 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Double Rob's time would be 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes.

"Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks:
6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks:
2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks:
10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

To find the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four, we add their individual rates:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."
"The bakers started with 200 loaves of bread. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, so they sold a total of:

"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Divide the total amount of raisins equally among the three uses (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix).
2. Calculate how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with the raisins allocated for the cookies.

First, we divide the 27 cups of raisins equally among the three uses:

\[ \text{Raisins per use} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with 9 cups of raisins, given that each batch requires \(\frac{3}{4}\) cup of raisins:

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find her weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 days:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At a rate of $1.50 per kWh, her weekly bill is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \]

Now, let's calculate her weekly consumption after adding the new device.

The new device consumes 2 kWh per hour. So, her total daily consumption will be:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} + 2 \, \text{kWh/hour} = 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \]

Her new daily consumption in kWh is:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At a rate of $1.50 per kWh, her new weekly bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528 \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \$504 \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then in one day, that person can paint \( \frac{1}{10} \) of a house. 

If 5 people are working together, they can paint \( 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \) of a house in one day. 

To paint a whole house, it would take them \( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \) days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \) hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Ophelia's sofas: 20
Ophelia's chairs: 22
Jenna's sofas: 64
Jenna's chairs: 66

Total number of sofas: 20 + 64 = 84

"To find out how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how much money Tom would have left if he didn't buy the headphone set.
3. Determine how many CDs he could buy with the remaining money.

First, we know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \).

The equation for the total cost is:
\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

Solving for \( H \):
\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we can calculate how many CDs he could buy with $48:
\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{48}{4} \]
\[ \text{Number of CDs} = 12 \]

Therefore, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 12 CDs. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and the specific weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours.

1. For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total for these weeks is:
   \(6 \times 4 = 24\) hours.

2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total for these weeks is:
   \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total for this week is:
   \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

Now, we add up all the hours:
\(24 + 10 + 6 = 40\) hours.

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so currently, Jame is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

2. In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

3. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, Jame's cousin will be 2 * 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

4. To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 55: 55 - 8 = 47 years old.

Now, to find the number of years that separate the age of the two now, we subtract Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:

47 - 22 = 25

The number of years that separate the age of the two now is 25."
"Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. The computer cost $1,100, and the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer, printer, and monitors is $2,400. So, the cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

Therefore, one monitor cost $300."

"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 31 mm * 2 = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these up: \(18 + 21 + 15 = 54\) vlogs.

Now, to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\(72 - 54 = 18\)

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of days in the first and second halves of the month:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April has 15 days.
   - The second half of April has 15 days.

2. **Define the daily savings in the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

3. **Define the daily savings in the second half:**
   - According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half.
   - Therefore, the daily savings in the second half is \( 2x \).

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half of the month:**
   - Total savings in the first half = \( 15x \).

5. **Calculate the total savings for the second half of the month:**
   - Total savings in the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

6. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - Total monthly savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half.
   - \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

7. **Equate the total monthly savings to the target:**
   - \( 45x = 1125 \).

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \).
   - \( x = 25 \).

9. **Determine the daily savings in the second half:**
   - Daily savings in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 additional bottles

So, Bill will need to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, twice the time it takes him in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that, he takes \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we calculate the total time for 3 miles in both conditions:

- Cold water: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes
- Warm water: \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes

The difference in time is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

1. The initial angle of the sun from the ground is the same as the angle of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour.
3. After 10 hours, the sun will have moved \(5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}\).

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid (32 degrees from the ground) and moves straight upward, the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the initial angle plus the angle it has moved:

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month (assuming an average month has about 4 weeks).
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
4. Find the difference between the total number of roses Ford grows in a month and the total number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

Let's start with step 1:

Ford supplies:
- 20 roses to the first flower shop
- 15 roses to the second flower shop
- 30 roses to the third flower shop

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 2: Assuming an average month has 4 weeks, the total number of roses supplied per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Step 3: Ford grows 40 roses every week. Therefore, in a month (4 weeks), he grows:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Step 4: The number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:
260 roses needed - 160 roses grown = 100 roses

Final numerical answer:

"To calculate how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to determine how many months are in 2 years and then calculate the total amount removed from the account.

1. There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are \(2 \times 12 = 24\) months.
2. Katina removes $100 from the account every month, so over 24 months, she will remove \(24 \times 100 = 2400\) dollars.
3. Katina started with $3000 in her account. After removing $2400, the remaining amount will be \(3000 - 2400 = 600\) dollars.

Therefore, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account."
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Cost of Bread:**
   - Each loaf of bread costs $3.00.
   - Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.

2. **Cost of Cheeses and Condiments:**
   - They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

3. **Total Cost per Sandwich:**
   - Total cost per sandwich = Cost of bread per sandwich + Cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich
   - Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30.

4. **Revenue per Sandwich:**
   - They sell each sandwich for $7.00.

5. **Net Profit per Sandwich:**
   - Net profit per sandwich = Revenue per sandwich - Total cost per sandwich
   - Net profit per sandwich = $7.00 - $3.30 = $3.70.

6. **Net Profit for 10 Sandwiches:**
   - If they sell 10 sandwiches, the net profit is 10 * $3.70 = $37.00.

Therefore, the net profit is $37.00."
"First, let's calculate the total number of crayons Kate has:

- There are 3 boxes of crayons.
- Each box contains 64 crayons.

So, the total number of crayons is:
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we need to determine how many crayon muffins Kate can make. Since she uses 8 small pieces of crayon for each muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:

\[ \frac{192}{8} = 24 \text{ muffins} \]

Now, if Kate sells each muffin for $1.50, we can calculate the total amount of money she can make by multiplying the number of muffins by the price per muffin:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown:

- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

Now, let's add these numbers together to get the total number of birds:

50 (days 1 and 2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (days 4 and 5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7) = 300 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:

300 birds / 7 days = 42.857142857142854 birds per day

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the average is approximately 43 birds per day.

Average number of birds Mack saw in a day: 43"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. We need to add half of this starting value to itself: \(20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30\).
3. Then, we divide this result by 5: \(\frac{30}{5} = 6\).
4. Next, we multiply this result by the starting value minus 12: \(6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48\).

So, the final value of the number train is 48."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting:

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the intended temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is then:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means Maggie's oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature would result in 520 degrees when the oven is 4% too hot.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Since the oven is 4% too hot, the actual temperature will be 104% of the setting temperature. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is 120 minutes, the second movie is:
\[ 120 + 5 = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 + 125 = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% less than the value of Herb's house. 

Herb's house is worth $76,000. 

30% of $76,000 is:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

So, Juan's house is worth:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, to find the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Judy brought 24 dishes, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is 12 (Judy's cups) + 40 (friend's cups) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by both Judy and her friend is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120 utensils.

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for 2 boxes is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts, so 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total hours worked by Jill:
- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday.
- Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours worked by John:
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both John and Jill:
- They are paid $10 per hour.
- Jill's total earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's total earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

For running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed (in ml) = (Total calories burned / 200) * 100

Plugging in the numbers:
(1600 / 200) * 100 = 8 * 100 = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

   - Weight gain from donuts: 8.75 pounds
   - Weight loss from Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \(8.75 \text{ pounds} - (-6.25 \text{ pounds}) = 8.75 \text{ pounds} + 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds}\)

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will also invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, there are 10 more people invited this way.
4. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will be bringing their spouses. So, there are 8 additional people (spouses) coming.

Now, let's sum up all the attendees:

- Initial email invites: 100
- Additional people from email invites: 200
- Friends invited by phone: 10
- Spouses: 8

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain:
\[ 200 \text{ grams} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, his daily protein intake is 6 grams. To find out how much protein he consumes in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily protein intake by 7:
\[ 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:

\[ -J = -10 \]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

2. For one of the implants, there's an extra cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we can find the measures of the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in nickels. Here's the breakdown:

- Colby has 8 quarters, which are worth 25 cents each, but we only need to convert them to nickels. 8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents. Since 1 nickel = 5 cents, 200 cents = 200 / 5 = 40 nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes, which are worth 10 cents each, but we need to convert them to nickels. 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents. Since 1 nickel = 5 cents, 60 cents = 60 / 5 = 12 nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which are already in the form we need.
- Colby has 15 pennies, which are worth 1 cent each, but we need to convert them to nickels. 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents. Since 1 nickel = 5 cents, 15 cents = 15 / 5 = 3 nickels.

Now, we add up all the nickels Colby has:
40 nickels (from quarters) + 12 nickels (from dimes) + 14 nickels (from nickels) + 3 nickels (from pennies) = 69 nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, he can make:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa makes:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make in 12 hours. Ruiz can make:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

And Marissa can make:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts together, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Let's break down the spending:

- On Monday, Howard spends $8.
- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money Howard spent:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \]

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \]

So, Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total money Patrick earned, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- So, in one hour, he earned 15 cups * $0.50 = $7.50.
- Over four hours, he earned 4 hours * $7.50 = $30.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- So, in one hour, he earned 10 cups * $0.60 = $6.00.
- Over two hours, he earned 2 hours * $6.00 = $12.

Now, we add the earnings from both parts:
- Total earnings = $30 (from the first four hours) + $12 (from the next two hours) = $42.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per month.
2. Calculate the total number of rotations per year.
3. Determine how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per month.**

Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile as follows:
\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \]

Now, for 400 miles:
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of rotations per year.**

Since there are 12 months in a year:
\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000}{1,740,000} = 6 \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in **6 years**."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:

\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, and it provides 120 washings:

\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the cost per washing to cents:

\[ \text{Cost per washing in cents} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents per washing} \]

Now, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the cost per washing by the number of washings per pump:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{20 \text{ cents}}{60 \text{ washings}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ cents} \approx 0.3333 \text{ cents} \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{0.33} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy.

The shirt costs $25 and there is a 30% discount on it. So, the discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

The discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts cost $35 and there is no discount mentioned for them, so the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, let's add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend, but the total cost of the outfit is $52.50. Since the total cost exceeds the amount Joe has, he cannot afford to buy both items. However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically or there's a mistake in the given values, we can still calculate how much he would be short by:
\[ 52.50 - 50 = 2.50 \]

But since the question asks for the remaining money, and Joe would not have any money left and would be short by $2.50, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{-2.50} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

The cost to repave Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$95,060 \]

Now, we find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
\[ \text{Difference} = \$95,060 - \$29,100 = \$65,960 \]

So, it costs \(\boxed{65960}\) more to repave Lewis' street."
"John initially gets funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months. The research ends up taking 10 times that long, so it takes 50 months in total. The first 5 months cost $100,000, and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month.

Let's calculate the cost for the remaining 45 months:

1. The cost for the 6th month is 1.5 times the cost of the 5th month, which is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.
2. The cost for the 7th month is 1.5 times the cost of the 6th month, which is $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000.
3. The cost for the 8th month is 1.5 times the cost of the 7th month, which is $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500.
4. This pattern continues for the remaining 45 months.

The cost for each month forms a geometric series where the first term \(a = 150,000\) and the common ratio \(r = 1.5\). The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by the formula:

\[ S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]

Here, \(a = 150,000\), \(r = 1.5\), and \(n = 45\). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{0.5} = 300,000 (1.5^{45} - 1) \]

Now, we need to calculate \(1.5^{45}\). Using a calculator, we find that \(1.5^{45} \approx 1,188,137.75\). Therefore:

\[ S_{45} = 300,000 (1,188,137.75 - 1) = 300,000 \times 1,188,136.75 = 356,441,025 \]

Adding the initial $100,000 for the first 5 months, the total cost of the research is:

\[ 100,000 + 356,441,025 = 356,541,025 \]

So, the total cost of John's research is:

\[ \boxed{356541025} \]"
"The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the team consumed a total of 30 ounces of meat."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, and there are 1000 members in the group. So, the total number of posts per day for the group is:

\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:

\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:

"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry:

\[ 2 \text{ times/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ times/year} \]

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses:

\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so for 2080 gallons, he spends:

\[ 2080 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.15/\text{gallon} = \$312 \]

Therefore, Gary spends \(\$312\) on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent, let's break down the costs:

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish: 20 at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, let's add all these costs together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches tall.

The final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches."
"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat in the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate how many days it will take for Prince to sell all the meat from the bull.

Step 1: The total amount of meat in the bull is 750kg.

Step 2: Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. So, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: To find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell all the meat from the bull, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium:

4 rows * 18 seats per row = 72 seats

Now, one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators:

72 seats / 4 = 18 seats occupied by administrators

The remaining seats after the administrators are seated are:

72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:

54 seats / 3 = 18 seats occupied by parents

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students:

54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats occupied by students

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

36 students"
"Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the number of street lights at one intersection is:

\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights on the road is:

\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

"John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time. So, each week he had 2 sessions of 2 hours each, which totals 4 hours per week.

The cost per hour for the sessions is $125.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spent in therapy and then multiply by the cost per hour.

Total hours = 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours

Total cost = 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000

The physical therapy cost John $3000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces of gum at school.
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.
4. After these chews, he has \( 20 - 4 - 1 - 1 = 14 \) pieces of gum left.
5. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) pieces.
6. Therefore, at the end of the day, he has \( 14 - 7 = 7 \) pieces of gum left.

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to reach the required height of 4 feet:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To calculate how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Total Revenue from Selling the Cars:**
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Total Cost to Acquire the Cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **James's Commission on the Profit:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
   \]

So, James made a total of $17,500."
"First, let's calculate how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we have:

\[ 100 \text{ riders} \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders can stay upright} \]

Next, we know that 60% of these riders who can stay upright are women. Therefore, the number of women who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women can stay upright} \]

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} - 15 \text{ women} = 10 \text{ men can stay upright} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, let's find the price of the gold jewel:
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \]

Next, let's find the price of the silver jewel:
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, let's find the total price for all three jewels:

Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the cost per class if he misses a certain number of classes.

The total cost for the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total. Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes.

The cost per class would then be:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Then, we divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes and still have the cost per class not exceed $10. 

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

1. Determine how many customers Julie processes per day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers each processes in a week.
3. Sum the weekly totals for both Julie and Jewel.

First, we know that Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers per day.

Next, we calculate the weekly production for each:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day, so in a week (7 days), she processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers.
- Julie processes 100 customers per day, so in a week, she processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers.

Finally, we add the weekly totals for both Julie and Jewel:

Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran \(20 - 3 = 17\) miles.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. Calculate the cost of one apple:
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30.

2. Calculate the cost of one orange:
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10.

3. Calculate the total cost for 5 apples:
   - The cost of one apple is $1.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of 5 apples is $1.30 × 5 = $6.50.

4. Calculate the total cost for 5 oranges:
   - The cost of one orange is $1.10.
   - Therefore, the cost of 5 oranges is $1.10 × 5 = $5.50.

5. Calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
   - The total cost is $6.50 (for apples) + $5.50 (for oranges) = $12.00.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[
30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500
\]

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \text{Original Monthly Salary} + (\text{Original Monthly Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + (\$20,000 \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + \$1,000 \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$21,000 \]

Next, we add the bonus worth half a month's salary to the new monthly salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{New Monthly Salary} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times \$21,000 \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \$10,500 \]

So, Tim's total monthly income after the raise and bonus is:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Income} = \text{New Monthly Salary} + \text{Bonus} \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Income} = \$21,000 + \$10,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Income} = \$31,500 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Income} = \text{Total Monthly Income} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Income} = \$31,500 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Income} = \$378,000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."
"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.

3. **Cost of dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 3 * 10 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts.
   - Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final numerical answer is:
$10800."

"To find the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total miles biked by both:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

The total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He has to dig 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay, which is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour.
- He has to dig 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time to dig through the soil and the time to dig through the clay:
- Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
2. The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats in the first month. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were $400 * 2 = $800.
3. The total sales in the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.
4. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the sales in the second month were $1200 * 3/4 = $900.
5. The total sales over the two months would be the sum of the sales from the first and second months, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, while geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We can set up the following system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they have together:

\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally among them, each person would get:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach this height, we subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are now 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12.
3. James buys 12 toys for these 12 dogs.
4. When he returns, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, meaning the number of dogs has doubled. So, the new total number of dogs is 12 * 2 = 24.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21.
7. Since there are 21 dogs, James needs 21 toys.

Now, let's add up all the toys James has bought:
- First purchase: 12 toys
- Second purchase: 12 toys
- Third purchase: 21 toys

Total number of toys needed: 12 + 12 + 21 = 45

Final numerical answer:
45"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The initial total investment is $1200.

2. Dylan invests 2/5 of the total amount:
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480
   \]

3. After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

4. Frances invests 2/3 of the remaining amount:
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480
   \]

5. After Frances's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 720 - 480 = 240
   \]

6. Skyler's investment is the rest of the remaining amount:
   \[
   \text{Skyler's investment} = 240
   \]

So, Skyler's investment is $240."
"To reach their goal of 100 signatures between them, the sisters need to calculate the number of additional signatures they need to collect.

First, let's find out how many signatures they currently have together:
Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures.
20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Now, let's find out how many more signatures they need to reach 100:
100 - 64 = 36 signatures

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, so Karen earns $20 per hour (since Lorie earns $10 per hour).

If Karen works 3 hours per day, she earns $20 * 3 = $60 per day.

In two days, Karen earns $60 * 2 = $120.

Karen earns $120 in two days."
"To solve this, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

So, for 96 potatoes, we can calculate the number of hash browns as follows:

\[
\frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes} \times 36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 16 \times 36 = 576 \text{ hash browns}
\]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"To find out by how much the group of people will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 people (Jack and 8 other adults) and then subtract the maximum load of the elevator from this total weight.

1. Calculate the total weight of the 9 adults:
   \[ 9 \text{ adults} \times 80 \text{ kg/adult} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

2. Subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
4. Katarina has 68 cookies.

From point 1, we can say that Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

From point 2, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has:
Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

From point 3, we can find out how many cookies Summer has:
Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each person has:
Katarina: 68
Max: 73
Cookie Monster: 61
Summer: 96

Total = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

Therefore, they have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the length is increased by \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the final length of the dress is the original length plus the extension plus the lace trim:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

Final answer:
80"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). So, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. So, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times for both modes to get the total time:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

So, the time they have already spent is:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

The total time they have is 30 minutes, so the time they have left to get to school is:
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

Therefore, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of that twin would be \( x + 7 \).

The other triplet and the other twin would be the same age as the younger triplet and the younger twin, respectively, because they are part of a set of twins and a set of triplets. So, the other triplet is also \( x \) years old, and the other twin is also \( x + 7 \) years old.

The combined ages of all four individuals are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 4x + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the younger triplet is 7.5 years old. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the triplet, is:

\[ x + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 14.5 years old."
"First, let's convert the 3 hours before dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we'll add up the time John needs to finish his homework:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Now, we'll subtract the total homework time from the time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has left for a nap:
180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40.

2. Calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
   \[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

3. Subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies:
   \[ \$3.20 - \$2.00 = \$1.20 \]

4. Since this is the cost for four candies, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing by 4:
   \[ \frac{\$1.20}{4} = \$0.30 \]

5. Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. We already know the cost of one lollipop and one candy:
   \[ 10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00 \]
   \[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.30 \text{ per candy} = \$3.00 \]

6. Add the cost of the lollipops and candies together to get the total cost:
   \[ \$4.00 + \$3.00 = \$7.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \$7.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of coins each person has saved over a period of ten years, given their monthly savings rates.

First, let's determine how many coins Rong saves in a month and then over ten years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Over ten years (which is 120 months), Rong will save:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, let's calculate how many coins Neil saves in a month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong each month. So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins} \right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

Over ten years (120 months), Neil will save:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil over ten years to find the combined total:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the cost of the vaccines:
   - Each vaccine costs $20, and the dog needs 2 vaccines.
   - Total cost for vaccines = $20 * 2 = $40.

2. Let the cost of the heartworm check be \( x \).

3. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. So, we can write:
   - \( x = 0.60 \times \text{Total Bill} \).

4. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
   - Total Bill = $40 + \( x \).

5. Substitute \( x \) from step 3 into the equation for the total bill:
   - Total Bill = $40 + 0.60 \times \text{Total Bill}.

6. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \):
   - \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

7. Solve for \( T \):
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \),
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \),
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \),
   - \( T = 100 \).

So, the total bill is $100.

8. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

The price for such a crate of fruit is **32 dollars**."
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 4 more than red squares = 14 + 4 = 18
3. Green squares: 6 more than blue squares = 18 + 6 = 24
4. White squares: 12 fewer than green squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we add up all the squares:
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points = 50 + (30/100 * 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points = 65 - 30 = 35 points.
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Martha's points = 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:

Adam's points: 50
Betty's points: 65
Tom's points: 35
Martha's points: 105

Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. So, the class is missing:

1. Calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city.
2. Determine how many of those fireworks Hannah will see.
3. Calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard.
4. Add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city display to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

Let's start with step 1:

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, the total number of fireworks set off by the city is:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

Next, step 2:

Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. So, the number of fireworks Hannah will see from the city display is:

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

13 + 7 = 20

Each person saves a seat and buys drinks and snacks for the seat. Each seat requires 2 drinks and 3 snacks. Since drinks and snacks cost $2 each, we can calculate the cost for drinks and snacks per seat:

Cost of drinks per seat = 2 drinks * $2/drink = $4
Cost of snacks per seat = 3 snacks * $2/snack = $6

Total cost per seat = Cost of drinks + Cost of snacks = $4 + $6 = $10

Since there are 20 seats, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:

Total cost = 20 seats * $10/seat = $200

"The cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second

To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

Their goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Next, we need to find out how much money they raised in the first 3 hours. Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, the amount raised per hour is:

$2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

$4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours to reach their goal.

Therefore, in total, they need to fundraise for:

3 hours (already done) + 6 hours (needed) = 9 hours

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract that percentage from the total percentage used by the city to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: Subtract the industrial usage from the total usage by the city to find the non-industrial usage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then sum the amounts produced in the given time.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for each type of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we sum the total production of both types of ice cream:
- Total quarts produced in 48 hours = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final numerical answer is:

$45.00"
"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how the deal works. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, for 4 scoops, she would get 2 free (since 4 scoops is 2 sets of 2 scoops).

Therefore, Erin should buy 4 scoops to maximize her ice cream consumption with the deal.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats:
4 pieces/day * 14 days = 56 pieces

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats:
3 pieces/day * 14 days = 42 pieces

Both started with 100 pieces, so after two weeks:

Ginger has:
100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces

Amy has:
100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces

To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks:
58 pieces - 44 pieces = 14 pieces

Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks."

"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps per minute for each foot when her arms are down and when they are raised.

When her arms are down:
- Right foot: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot: 250 taps per minute

When her arms are raised:
- Right foot: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot: 200 taps per minute

Now, let's calculate the total taps for each foot during the 5 minutes of dancing.

For the first 3 minutes (with arms down):
- Right foot: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)

For the next 2 minutes (with arms raised):
- Right foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)

Now, we sum up the taps for each foot:
- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150\)

Finally, we add the total taps for both feet:
- Combined total taps: \(1300 + 1150 = 2450\)

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is 2450."
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of having the city fix it and the total cost of Ron fixing it himself, then find the difference between these two amounts.

1. The cost of having the city fix the pothole is $450.
2. The cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself includes a fine of $120 and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each.

First, calculate the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself:
- Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
- Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 * $25 = $75

Total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself = $120 + $75 = $195

Now, calculate the savings:
Savings = Cost of city fixing - Cost of Ron fixing
Savings = $450 - $195 = $255

Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

**Final Answer:**

"Bryce and his four friends make a total of 5 people. Each person ordered one pizza, and each pizza has 12 slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices:
5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices

Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, for each of these 3 people, the number of slices eaten is:
(2/3) * 12 slices = 8 slices

Total slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends:
3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. So, for each of these 2 people, the number of slices eaten is:
(3/4) * 12 slices = 9 slices

Total slices eaten by the two remaining friends:
2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices

Total slices eaten by all five friends:
24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Now, to find the number of slices left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices:
60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

Final numerical answer:
18 slices"
"The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes.

The dog can eat the same number of sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. So, the time it takes for the dog to eat nine sausages is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we add the time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and then divide by 2:
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( B \) inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be expressed as:
\[ 9B + 10 \]

We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches:
\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 9B + 10 = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation:
\[ 9B + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 9B = 100 - 10 \]
\[ 9B = 90 \]
\[ B = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ B = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find out how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows she smashes for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \]

Since each of these 16 cars has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars is:
\[ 16 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \]

Since each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is:
\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed for the students' cars and the teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
112"

- The cost for each adult is $26, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for adults is \(26 \times 2 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for each child is $12, and there are 2 children, so the total cost for children is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $14, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for adults is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for each child is $10, and there are 2 children, so the total cost for children is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two parks:
- The difference is \(76 - 48 = 28\) dollars.

So, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars by choosing the second amusement park over the first."
"To calculate how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find the daily savings:

- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each.
- Now, he buys them for $0.40 each.
- The difference in price per tomato is $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10.

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so his daily savings are:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times $0.10/\text{tomato} = $50/\text{day} \]

Now, to find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ $50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = $350/\text{week} \]

So, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"If Sean has 56 marbles, and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, then Cal has:

\[ 56 \times 2 = 112 \text{ marbles} \]

Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, Carl has:

\[ 56 \times 4 = 224 \text{ marbles} \]

To find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together:

\[ 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, Carl and Cal have a combined total of 336 marbles."

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the number of chairs rented during a weekday and a weekend in one week:
   - Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
   - Weekends: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
   - Total for one week: 300 chairs (weekdays) + 200 chairs (weekends) = 500 chairs

2. Calculate the number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
   - 4 weeks * 500 chairs/week = 2000 chairs

3. Calculate the number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
   - 2 * 2000 chairs = 4000 chairs

Therefore, in two 4-week months, Candy will be able to rent out a total of 4000 chairs."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gunther starts with 48 bananas.
2. Arnold steals half of the bananas:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, Gunther is left with:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]
3. The next day, Gunther adds 25 more bananas:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}

"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly share for each roommate.
2. Multiply the monthly share by 12 to find the yearly share for each roommate.

Step 1: The total monthly electricity bill is $100, and there are 5 people (Jenna and her 4 roommates) sharing the bill equally. So, the monthly share for each person is:
\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Step 2: To find the yearly share, we multiply the monthly share by 12:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \]

So, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity."
"Jeff initially sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party.

8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for a large button, so 27 small buttons = 27 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left and 40 + 27 = 67 large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 67 large stickers = 0.5 * 67 = 33.5, but since we can't have half a sticker, we'll assume she trades 33 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 33 large stickers = 33 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 67 - 33 = 34 large stickers left and 67 + 33 = 100 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 34 large stickers left, and each large sticker is worth three small buttons.
   - 34 large stickers = 34 * 3 = 102 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 34 large stickers left and 102 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 100 large buttons and 102 small buttons.
   - Since each large button is worth three small stickers, and each small sticker is worth one small button, the large buttons are already in the form of buttons.
   - Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has is 100 large buttons + 102 small buttons = 202 buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, so \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the students:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-large: 15

Total number of shirts = \(11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75\)

"First, let's calculate how many people think horse #2 will win:

20% of 50 people = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

Now, we subtract those 10 people from the total to find out how many are left:

50 - 10 = 40 people

Next, we calculate how many of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:

60% of 40 people = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

Finally, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people to find out how many think horse #12 will win:

40 - 24 = 16 people

So, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race.

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles. 

Final numerical answer:

They have read 600 books altogether."
"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5, making her total for Monday \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

2. A third of the movies are in series, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
3. The cost for the series is $6 each, so the total cost for the series is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
4. The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
5. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older movies.
6. The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
7. The remaining movies are \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies, and these are normal movies.
8. The cost for the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

We know the point system:
- 10 points for each enemy jumped on.
- 5 points for each berry collected.
- 30 points for each second left on the timer when the level is finished.

Let's denote:
- The number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \).
- The number of berries Emma collects as \( B_e \).
- The number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level as \( T_e \).

Then, for Ava:
- The number of enemies Ava jumps on is \( E_e + 8 \).
- The number of berries Ava collects is \( B_e + 3 \).
- The number of seconds left on the timer when Ava finishes the level is \( T_e + 4 \).

Now, let's calculate the scores:

Emma's score:
\[ \text{Score}_e = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e \]

Ava's score:

Now we can solve these equations step by step. First, let's simplify the second equation:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O + W = 17 \)
2. \( O - 2W = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the elimination method. First, we'll multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( W \):

\[ 2O + 2W = 34 \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now, we add these two equations together to eliminate \( W \):

\[ (2O + 2W) + (O - 2W) = 34 + 5 \]
\[ 3O = 39 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

Now that we have \( O = 13 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( W \):

\[ 13 + W = 17 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store. 

The final numerical answer is:

"Carrie was given 10 twenties and 140 quarters.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money she received:

- The total amount from the twenties: \(10 \times 20 = 200\) dollars.
- The total amount from the quarters: \(140 \times 0.25 = 35\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money she received is \(200 + 35 = 235\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate how much she spent:

- She spent \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties: \(\frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120\) dollars.
- She spent all the quarters: \(35\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money she paid for the lunch is \(120 + 35 = 155\) dollars.

Final answer:

"First, let's determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Now, to prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature needs to be at least 32 degrees. Since the temperature drops to 12 degrees during the night, Carson needs to raise the temperature by:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, let's determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. We do this by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 0.30 \times (14 + x) = x \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30x = x \]
\[ 4.2 + 0.30x = x \]
\[ 4.2 = x - 0.30x \]

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 passed out of 500.
- Fourth-graders: 40 passed out of 100.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\) or 80%. Therefore, 400 fifth-graders passed \(400 \times 0.8 = 320\).

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\).
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\).

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

Let the amount of salt used be \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.

According to the problem, the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express all the ingredients in terms of \( z \):
- Citrus zest: \( z \) ounces
- Fragrance: \( z \) ounces
- Salt: \( 2z \) ounces
- Sugar: \( 2z \) ounces
- Oil: \( 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \) ounces

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of all these ingredients, which is 10 ounces:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil used:

"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 48 cupcakes.

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. We start with the initial number of cars and subtract the number sold and given away:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount raised by the students.
2. Divide that amount by the number of students.

First, we know the total amount raised by the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students, which is 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\) dollars."
"Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time she walked in the two days, we add the hours from both days: 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

50 + 20 = 70 cars

When he got out for lunch, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the amount he earns in a day.
3. Calculate the amount he earns in a week.

Step 1: Number of tasks per day
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the number of tasks per day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\).

Step 2: Earnings per day
Each task pays $1.20.
So, the earnings per day are \(150 \times 1.20 = 180\) dollars.

Step 3: Earnings per week
John works a full 7-day week.
So, the earnings per week are \(180 \times 7 = 1260\) dollars.

Therefore, John makes \(\boxed{1260}\) dollars in a week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored:
14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored:
10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from both games:
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

Total points Sasha scored during both games:

"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tins of cat food.
2. Calculate the total number of tins of dog food.
3. Subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total tins of cat food = Number of packages of cat food × Tins per package
   = 8 × 11
   = 88 tins

2. Total tins of dog food = Number of packages of dog food × Tins per package
   = 6 × 6
   = 36 tins

3. Difference in tins = Total tins of cat food - Total tins of dog food
   = 88 - 36
   = 52 tins

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, the number of cards Becca has is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3\) yellow eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of each color of egg together:

\[5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27\]

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund Milly will receive, then subtract the refund from the cost of the book.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - The total shipping cost is the sum of the cost per pound and the cost per mile.
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund Milly will receive:**
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund} = 75\% \times \$32 = 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The net loss is the cost of the book minus the refund, plus the shipping cost.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = \$32 - \$24 + \$3.00 = \$11.00
     \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her $100, so she has:

$40 + $100 = $140

She then buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs:

2 * $30 = $60

And she buys a bag for $20. So the total cost of her purchases is:

$60 + $20 = $80

Subtracting the total cost of her purchases from her total money gives:

$140 - $80 = $60

Mulan has $60 left."
"Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: Half of the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
- Third week: Three times the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and subtract it from the monthly production.

Total production for the first three weeks:
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars

Total monthly production:
50,000 bars

Production in the fourth week:
50,000 (total monthly production) - 36,000 (production in the first three weeks) = 14,000 bars

"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to consider the time she spends on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Recording Videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Time spent per week on recording videos = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - Time spent per month on recording videos = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Writing Songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Time spent per month on writing songs = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.

3. **Doing Makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Time spent per week on doing makeup = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.
   - Time spent per month on doing makeup = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, let's convert all the time spent into a common unit, such as minutes, to sum them up:

- Total time spent on recording videos in a month = 288 minutes.
- Total time spent on writing songs in a month = 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.
- Total time spent on doing makeup in a month = 360 minutes.

Total time spent on TikTok in a month = 288 minutes + 480 minutes + 360 minutes = 1128 minutes.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges:

1. The base installation cost includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, which is $129.00.
2. Angela needs 6 mirrors, which is 2 more than the base installation includes. So, she will need to pay an additional $15.00 for each of these 2 extra mirrors.
3. Angela also needs 2 additional chandeliers, which will cost an extra $15.00 each.
4. Angela needs 20 pictures, which is 10 more than the base installation includes. So, she will need to pay an additional $15.00 for each of these 10 extra pictures.

Now, let's calculate the additional costs:

- Additional mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 2 chandeliers * $15.00/chandelier = $30.00
- Additional pictures: 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00

Adding these to the base installation cost:

- Base installation: $129.00
- Additional mirrors: $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: $30.00
- Additional pictures: $150.00

Total cost = $129.00 + $30.00 + $30.00 + $150.00 = $349.00

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in feet, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high (12 inches * 4).
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high (48 inches * 10).

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the two distances together gives the total distance traveled:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the time it would take for one kangaroo to do the same distance. Since the speed is the same for all kangaroos, the time for one kangaroo would be the same as for three, which is 18 hours.

2. Now, we know that one kangaroo takes 18 hours to cross the highway. Let's denote the distance of the highway as \(D\) and the speed of one kangaroo as \(S\). We can write the equation for the distance as:
   \[
   D = S \times 18
   \]

3. The speed of one turtle is half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{S}{2} \).

4. We need to find out how long it will take for four turtles to cross the same distance \(D\). The time \(T\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   D = 4 \times \left(\frac{S}{2}\right) \times T
   \]
   Since \(D = S \times 18\), we can substitute \(D\) in the equation:
   \[
   S \times 18 = 4 \times \left(\frac{S}{2}\right) \times T
   \]
   Simplifying the right side of the equation:
   \[
   S \times 18 = 2S \times T
   \]
   We can cancel \(S\) from both sides (assuming \(S \neq 0\)):
   \[
   18 = 2T
   \]
   Solving for \(T\):
   \[
   T = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]

So, it will take four turtles 9 hours to cross the highway. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada makes:
2 * 40 (Rory's dishes) = 80 dishes.

Together, they make:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 40 (Rory's dishes) + 80 (Jada's dishes) = 140 dishes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, which totals $150 + $80 = $230.
4. Erika now needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has, including the money in her purse, is $400 - $50 = $350.
5. To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we subtract the $230 she has from other sources from the total amount she has, which is $350 - $230 = $120.

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow. With 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, he needs:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we first need to determine the annual interest earned and then multiply it by the number of years.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is $300. So, the annual interest is:

\[ \text{Annual Interest} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

Since the interest is simple, it will be the same each year. Over 3 years, the total interest earned will be:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Now, we add the total interest to the original amount to find the total amount after 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Original Amount} + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975."

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( L \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( A = L + 2 \).
3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( A + B + L + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( L \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ L = A - 2 \]

Next, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ B = A + 3 \]

Now, we can substitute \( B \) and \( L \) into the equation for \( M \):
\[ M = 3B - 1 = 3(A + 3) - 1 = 3A + 9 - 1 = 3A + 8 \]

Now we substitute \( B \), \( L \), and \( M \) into the sum of all ages:
\[ A + (A + 3) + (A - 2) + (3A + 8) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ A + A + 3 + A - 2 + 3A + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6A + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6A = 78 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
- There are 27 students.
- Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
- Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Step 2: Determine how many packs are required.
- Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
- To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack and round up to the nearest whole number because he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.
- 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.
- Since he can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 7 packs.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Each infected person infects six others every day, so the number of new infections each day is six times the number of infected people from the previous day.

Let's break it down day by day:

- **Day 0 (initial):** 10 people are infected.
- **Day 1:** Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2:** Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others, so \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3:** Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others, so \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, after three days, the total number of infected people is **3430**."
"Rafaela received $20 from each of the forty customers, so the total amount of tips she received is:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, so we need to calculate 10% of $800 and subtract it from $800:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual amounts:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"Claire earns 1 badge every month. 

In a year, Claire would earn:
1 badge/month * 12 months/year = 12 badges/year

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same time Claire earns 1 badge, Amber earns 1/2 badge. Therefore, in a year, Amber would earn:
(1 badge/month / 2) * 12 months/year = 6 badges/year

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in a year, Wendy would earn:
3 * 12 badges/year = 36 badges/year

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract Amber's badges from Wendy's badges:
36 badges/year (Wendy) - 6 badges/year (Amber) = 30 badges

Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"Paige bakes 2 banana bread loaves every hour. She bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

- Leftover burritos = 600 - 520 = 80.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. There are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.
4. The total number of cars is 75.

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52\]

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

From the second equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = A + 25 \]
Substituting \( A = F - 12 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

- The bag of sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, so the sweet potatoes weighed \(5 \times 2 = 10\) pounds.

Next, we find the weight of the carrots:
- The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weighed \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds.

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many boxes of jello are required.
3. Calculate the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

Greg wants each of the 30 kids to have 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are required.**

Each box makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes are needed for 120 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per box:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**

Each box of jello costs $1.25. So, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total monthly cost for Keenan.
2. Divide the monthly cost by 4 to find the weekly cost.

First, we know that Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, so Keenan pays the remaining 40%. The total monthly cost is $400.

To find Keenan's share of the monthly cost:
\[ \text{Keenan's monthly cost} = 40\% \times 400 = 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \]

Now, to find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his monthly cost by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month):
\[ \text{Keenan's weekly cost} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.

First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them:

\[
\text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180
\]

Next, we know that Isaias plans to sell these 180 chickens at $50 each. So, the total revenue from selling the chickens is:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens he took to the market is the total revenue minus the profit:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
\]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for \(\boxed{7000}\)."
"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses the boys sold in total.

The total number of glasses sold by the boys is:
32 (total glasses) - 14 (Julie's glasses) = 18 glasses

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2:
18 / 2 = 9 glasses

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12.

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

- Total cost of bacon: $10
- Total cost of chicken: $24
- Total cost of strawberries: $12
- Total cost of apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:

$65 - $60 = $5

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total number of orchid petals = Number of orchids × Petals per orchid
   = 5 × 5
   = 25

2. Total number of daisy petals = Number of daisies × Petals per daisy
   = 4 × 10
   = 40

3. Difference in the number of petals = Total daisy petals - Total orchid petals
   = 40 - 25
   = 15

So, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Total number of plants = 100
2. One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants:
   \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]
   So, there are 25 indoor plants.

3. The remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:
   \[ 100 - 25 = 75 \]

4. Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:
   \[ \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]
   So, there are 50 outdoor plants.

5. The rest of the plants are flowering plants:
   \[ 75 - 50 = 25 \]
   So, there are 25 flowering plants.

6. To find the percentage of flowering plants:
   \[ \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, a thingamabob spins at:

\[ \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, so it spins at:

\[ 5 \times 11 \text{ meters per second} = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

The final numerical answer is:

55 meters per second"
"Let's break down the costs:

1. The salad costs $6.
2. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost for the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods, so the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
5. Ellen eats 2 carrots a day, so the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. In the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's.
3. In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's.
4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

Then, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Assuming Tasha was paid the same amount for each lawn mowing, let's denote the payment per lawn mowing as \( p \).

From the information given, we know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Since Joe's lawn was mowed \( x \) times, we can write:
\[ x \cdot p = 6 \]

Now, the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is:
\[ (3x + 5x) \cdot p = 8x \cdot p \]

Since \( x \cdot p = 6 \), we can substitute \( 6 \) for \( x \cdot p \):
\[ 8x \cdot p = 8 \cdot 6 = 48 \]

So, Tasha made $48 from mowing lawns.

Since Tasha made a total of $80, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

Therefore, Tasha made $32 from lemonade sales."

"Susan originally made 100 cookies. Her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself, leaving 100 - 4 = 96 cookies.

Now, these 96 cookies are to be equally divided among her 6 nephews.

To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of nephews:

96 cookies ÷ 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew.

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel did not read any pages today, so his total remains 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total:

28 (Denise's total) - 13 (Daniel's total) = 15 pages.

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children.

Each child's bowl is half the size of an adult's bowl, so 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls (since 2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls).

Calvin has 4 child bowls of soup in total, and he needs to serve 2 child bowls for lunch. This leaves him with 2 child bowls of soup as leftovers.

Since there are 2 children, each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch."
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50.

"To determine how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask separately and then sum the totals.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- To make 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- To make 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Adding the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

The final numerical answer is:
16 yards"
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets purchased.

First, we know there are 9 movies and Deepa has seen each one 3 times. So, the total number of times she saw the movies is:
\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ times} \]

Next, we know she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:
\[ \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} = 8 \text{ dollars per ticket} \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is:
\[ 8 \]

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time he spends on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walk his dog: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

"Duncan's current age is 60. Eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as \( A \). According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So we can write the equation:

\[ 52 = 2A \]

Solving for \( A \):

\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

So, Adam was 26 years old four years ago. Therefore, Adam's current age is 26 + 4 = 30 years old.

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.

The equation representing the total number of pieces of bologna can be written as:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Subtract 40 from both sides to solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The pool has 10,000 gallons of water, and they fill the tank with half of that amount:

\[ \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water:

\[ 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, after 6 days, there will be 2,000 gallons of water remaining in the tank."
"Let's break down the expenses and earnings step by step.

1. **Initial Spending:**
   - Colby has already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, so he has spent \(5 \times 10 = \$50\) on movie tickets.
   - He has also had 2 tubs of popcorn, so he has spent \(2 \times 8 = \$16\) on popcorn.
   - He has had 4 boxes of candy, so he has spent \(4 \times 2 = \$8\) on candy.

2. **Total Spent So Far:**
   - Total spent = \(50 + 16 + 8 = \$74\).

3. **Remaining Budget:**
   - Colby's parents give him $150 per month, so his remaining budget is \(150 - 74 = \$76\).

4. **Current Day and Planned Spending:**
   - It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday, so he wants to see a movie, get a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy.
   - Cost of a movie ticket on a Friday or Saturday = \$10.
   - Cost of a tub of popcorn = \$8.
   - Cost of a box of candy = \$2.
   - Total planned spending for the night = \(10 + 8 + 2 = \$20\).

5. **Remaining Budget After Planned Spending:**
   - Remaining budget after planned spending = \(76 - 20 = \$56\).

6. **Number of Additional Movies He Can See:**
   - Since the remaining budget is \$56 and each movie ticket costs \$10, the number of additional movies he can see is \(\left\lfloor \frac{56}{10} \right\rfloor = 5\) (where \(\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor\) is the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\)).

Therefore, the total number of movies he can see this month is the 5 movies he has already seen plus the 5 additional movies he can see with his remaining budget.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so:
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)

On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of Junebugs removed:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Adding these together:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 300\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[\frac{300}{5} = 60\]

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it covers is:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it covers is:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
\[ 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
The total number of toys is 62.

Let's add up the known quantities:

31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of toys:

62 (total toys) - 48 (known toys) = 14

So, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

Final numerical answer:
50"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 4 + 1 (Maria) = 5 people in total.
2. Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons.
3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
4. Then her mom gave each person 3 more balloons, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 balloons.

Now, let's add them all up:

- Initial balloons given to friends: 8
- Balloons Maria had: 1
- Additional balloons given by her mom: 15

Total balloons = 8 + 1 + 15 = 24

The total number of balloons the girls had is 24."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and the boxes they already have:

- 10 people donate 5 boxes each: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes
- They already have 10 boxes

So, the total number of boxes is \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes, given that each table can fit 2 boxes:

- Total boxes / Boxes per table = \(60 / 2 = 30\) tables

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is:

- Total tables needed - Tables they already have = \(30 - 15 = 15\)

Therefore, they need 15 new tables.

- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey: \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney: \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Now, we find the average of these two totals:
- Total distance spat by both: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet
- Average total distance spat: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."

1. Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

**Final Answer:**

"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours.

The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), he will pay 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would have cost 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour plus additional hours) = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is 10 pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

For the 15 goats, Nate needs 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay.

For the 12 sheep, Nate needs 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay.

In total, Nate needs 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay.

"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week:

John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he deposits $100 in the bank:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from his remaining money:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, let's apply the 40% discount:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

$150 - $60 = $90

Next, James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

Now, let's calculate how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs:

He initially spent $90 and then received $200 from selling 5 CDs, so the net amount he was out is:

$90 - $200 = -$110

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $110. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a loss. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

$110"
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, we add up the totals:
$9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the distance James swims initially.
2. Determine the time it takes to swim that distance.
3. Calculate the rest time.
4. Determine the remaining distance.
5. Calculate the time it takes to swim the remaining distance at the reduced speed.
6. Sum up all the times to get the total time.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the time it takes to swim that distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   The rest time is half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the remaining distance at the reduced speed:**
   James swims the remaining distance at half the original speed, which is 1 mile per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Sum up all the times to get the total time:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."

1. Determine how many loaves Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result to find the number of loaves the bakery has.

Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate:

1. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had: \(7 \times 70 = 490\)
2. Subtract 40 from 490: \(490 - 40 = 450\)

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread."

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total commission.

Let's start with the New York Times:

- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission from the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \text{ copies} \times \$5 \text{ per copy} \times 10\% = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = \$3 \]

Now, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:

- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \text{ copies} \times \$15 \text{ per copy} \times 8\% = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = \$12 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts to get the total commission:

\[ \$3 + \$12 = \$15 \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \$15 \]"
"Deanna is 26 years old.

Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is:

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

Final answer:
Azibo scored 5 points."

"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Multiply the number of 15-minute intervals by the number of reports Vince can staple in each interval.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert 15 hours into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Sleepwalking Duration:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Usual Wake-Up Time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - On this particular day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier, so her wake-up time was 5:55 a.m.

4. **Actual Sleep Duration:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is the actual time Kim was asleep.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours, which is 480 minutes.
   - From 6 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 55 minutes.
   - Total actual sleep duration: \(480 + 55 = 535\) minutes.

"Initially, the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. 

First, calculate the number of occupied beds:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds} \]

So, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ beds} \]

Next, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions is:
\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients} \]

Now, add these new admissions to the initial number of occupied beds:
\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ beds} \]

Finally, calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney reported 48 people in attendance and Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%, we can calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%). This can be expressed as:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.

Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them:

\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey would have carried 1 ball (since Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey), and Jordan would have carried 4 balls (twice as many as Jason). Therefore, the total number of balls would be:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Since the total number of balls is \( 7J \) and we know that \( 7J = 7 \), we can solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 1 \]

So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried 4 balls. The total number of balls is:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's first calculate the total number of holes dug and filled in by the end of the third day.

- First day: 10 holes dug
- Second day: 13 holes dug
- Third day: 8 holes dug, but 2 holes were filled in

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 8 (third day) = 31 holes dug

The number of holes filled in by the end of the third day is 2.

Therefore, the net number of holes by the end of the third day is:
31 (holes dug) - 2 (holes filled) = 29 holes

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes dug. So, the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
4 * 10 = 40 holes

To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes by the end of the third day from the number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
40 (holes by the end of the fourth day) - 29 (holes by the end of the third day) = 11 holes

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

1. Determine the cost of the supplies.
2. Calculate the cost of the travel tickets, which is 50% more than the cost of the supplies.
3. Add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the travel tickets to get the total travel cost.

Let's start with the cost of the supplies, which is given as $400.

Next, we calculate the cost of the travel tickets. Since the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to find 50% of $400 and add it to $400.

50% of $400 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the travel tickets to get the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the total travel cost is:
\[ \boxed{1000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so we can write:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write:
\[ X = S + 5 \]

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can write:
\[ X + S + A = 339 \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) in terms of \( A \) into the total equation:
\[ (4A - 13 + 5) + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4A - 8 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan:
\[ S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon."
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes in total.

If John watches every episode, he will spend 20 minutes x 10 episodes = 200 minutes watching the show.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance she flew in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_3 = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

The total distance flown south is the sum of the first and third distances:
\[
\text{Total Southward Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_3 = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]

The total distance flown north is the second distance:
\[
\text{Total Northward Distance} = \text{Distance}_2 = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the difference between the total southward distance and the total northward distance:
\[
\text{Net Distance} = \text{Total Southward Distance} - \text{Total Northward Distance} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374}
\]"
"Greta initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

When she arrived home, there were 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party is:
12 (initial batch) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

The number of brownies left over is:
66 (total) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies.

Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice his age, so the brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, the sister is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   \(3 \text{ racquets} \times 15 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 45 \text{ minutes}\)

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Now, we add up the total time:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all of the racquets."
"John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
2 * $600 = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the last 2 phones is:
2 * $300 = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the last 2 phones together, we get the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid $1800 for all the phones."
"Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

The total number of players in both teams combined is 13 + 20 = 33 players."
"To calculate the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to determine the perimeter of the rectangular fence.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. 

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of boxes she kept in terms of the total is:
8 boxes * 1/4 = 2 boxes

This means she sold the rest of the boxes, which is:
8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \cdot 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books.

The cost of the dictionary is $18.
The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14, so we need to find out how much more money he needs to buy the books:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford the books.

"Robert has 30 cherries, which is 10 more than Richard. So, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

The total number of cherries is 60. If we subtract the cherries that Richard and Robert have, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has:

60 - 30 (Robert's cherries) - 20 (Richard's cherries) = 10 cherries for Jerry.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

30 (Robert's cherries) - 10 (Jerry's cherries) = 20 cherries.

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"Let's break down the sales for each day and then calculate the total earnings.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 10 boxes
- Apple pie sold: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie sold: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day.

**Saturday Earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
- Apple pie: 6 boxes * $15 = $90
- Total for Saturday: $60 + $90 = $150

**Sunday Earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
- Apple pie: 15 boxes * $15 = $225
- Total for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

**Total Earnings for Two Days:**
- Total for Saturday + Total for Sunday = $150 + $315 = $465

Sunny earned a total of $465 for the two days."
"Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. She will be outside for 4 hours a day, so she will use:

\[ 1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours/day} = 4 \, \text{ounces/day} \]

Over 8 days, she will use:

\[ 4 \, \text{ounces/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces} \]

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle:

\[ \frac{32 \, \text{ounces}}{8 \, \text{ounces/bottle}} = 4 \, \text{bottles} \]

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

First, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price:
40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
$100 - $40 = $60

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
$100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160

The total cost of both cars is $160."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.

Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years, so his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

Similarly, his brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

"First, let's find out how many students are football players. 

20% of 30 students are football players:
\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after removing the football players:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band:
\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 more students are cheerleaders or part of the band.

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed and then calculate the cost of the additional plants she needs to buy.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the width of the plants and the space between them are given in inches, we'll convert the length of the flower bed to inches as well.

111 feet = 111 * 12 inches = 1332 inches

Each plant grows 12 inches wide, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:

12 inches (plant) + 18 inches (space) = 30 inches

Now, we can calculate how many plants can fit in the 1332 inches of the flower bed:

1332 inches / 30 inches per plant = 44.4 plants

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

44 - 17 = 27 more plants

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

27 plants * $6 per plant = $162

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."

"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost of the petunias for one basket:
- Each basket has 3 petunias.
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Therefore, the cost of petunias for one basket is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines for one basket:
- Each basket has 2 sweet potato vines.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
- Therefore, the cost of sweet potato vines for one basket is \(2 \times 2.50 = 5\) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost for one basket by adding the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines:
- The total cost for one basket is \(9 + 5 = 14\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost for all 5 baskets:
- The total cost for 5 baskets is \(5 \times 14 = 70\) dollars.

Therefore, Katherine will spend \(\boxed{70}\) dollars filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then subtract that from the total amount of soil they have.

First, let's calculate the soil needed for the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They plant 4 sunflowers.

Soil for sunflowers = 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Next, let's calculate the soil needed for the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They plant 10 carnations.

Soil for carnations = 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
Total soil used = Soil for sunflowers + Soil for carnations
Total soil used = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. So, the remaining soil is:
Remaining soil = Total soil - Soil used
Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
Number of roses = Remaining soil / Soil per rose
Number of roses = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as:
\[ 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Now, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00, given that each pair costs $1,000.00. We divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for each task:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. The air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling on low: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. The air conditioner is then turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling on high: \(4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ degrees/hour} = 12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. After that, the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours, and the room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 4 \text{ degrees}\)

4. Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
   - Net cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\)
   - Net warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\)
   - Net change in temperature: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\)

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet.

First, we need to determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet for the first time. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, we can use this information to find out when Bill saw the Comet for the second time.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the second time Bill saw the Comet would be 75 years after his dad saw it. So, if Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, Bill would have seen it 75 years later.

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the second time. According to the problem, Bill was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet for the first time. So, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.

Since the Comet orbits every 75 years, the time between the first and second sighting for Bill is 75 years. Therefore, to find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time, we subtract 75 years from 90 years.

So, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. Electric bill: 1 check per month
   - In a year, there are 12 months, so he writes 1 * 12 = 12 checks for the electric bill.

2. Gas bill: 1 check per month
   - Similarly, for the gas bill, he writes 1 * 12 = 12 checks in a year.

3. Church: 2 checks per month
   - For the church, he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks in a year.

4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter
   - There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 1 * 4 = 4 checks for the pest and lawn service.

Now, we add up all the checks:
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks per year.

Therefore, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips each day. These trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips each day.

2. Out of these 88 trips, three-quarters of the flights are to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66
   \]

3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The number of remaining flights is:
   \[
   88 - 66 = 22
   \]
   Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
   \[
   \frac{22}{2} = 11

"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A = 3 \) (Akbar's age)
- \( B = 4 \) (Alessandro's age)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
- Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age equation as:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, the average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

So, the age of Wilfred is:

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else donated $2200, the lawyer's contribution will be:

3 * $2200 = $6600

So, the lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception:

100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies

The bride gave half of these cookies to the church next door:

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

So, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we need to divide the size of one adult's slice by the total size of the watermelon and then multiply by 100.

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the nine hours he has available.

1. Time spent on inpatient rounds:
   - He has 9 inpatients.
   - Each inpatient check takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for inpatient rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. Time spent on appointments:
   - He has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

3. Total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:
   - Total time = 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

4. Convert the total time spent into hours:
   - 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

5. Subtract the total time spent from the 9 hours available:
   - 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.

Now, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

Let's start with the cost per session for the studio:
- The studio rental cost per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session for the studio is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- There are typically 4 weeks in a month.
- So, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The total cost per month is \(480 \times 1 = 480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars:
\[ 4p = 64 \]

2. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars:
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, we solve for \( p \) and \( m \):

\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:

\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
4. Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the number of baby porcupines born each month is:
   \[
   \text{Number of baby porcupines per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

3. To find the total number of baby porcupines born in a year, we multiply the number of baby porcupines born each month by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
   \[
   \text{Number of baby porcupines in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

4. Finally, we add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population:
   \[
   \text{Final population} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

So, the number of porcupines in the park after a year is \(\boxed{1490}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the final cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, we can add up all the sticks:

- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

Total number of sticks = \(9 + 14 + 11 = 34\).

The final numerical answer is:
34"
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed: 55 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_Matteo = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed: 45 miles per hour
- Time: 10 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_Shandy = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy:

Distance_Shandy - Distance_Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps in one hour.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(14 / 2 = 7\) laps in one hour.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps in one hour.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: \(10 - 5 = 5\).

Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501678 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501678} \approx 0.558 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 56%.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{56\%} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save that amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times (\$10/\text{hour} + \$15/\text{hour}) = 40 \times \$25 = \$1000 \text{ per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.**

The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of that amount for a down payment. So, the down payment amount is:
\[ 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save that amount.**

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{\$2000}{\$1000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

**Final Answer:**

"Anne purchased a box of sweets containing 15 packs, with each pack having 60 pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of sweets in the box:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each of the 13 packs contains 60 pieces, so the total number of sweets given to her friends is:
\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since she gave these sweets equally to her 10 friends, the number of sweets each friend received is:
\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this case is the formula for compound price increase:

Where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total and divided them equally into 8 albums. So, each album contains:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ pictures} \]

Out of these 8 albums, 3 albums contain only selfies and 2 albums contain only portraits. This means there are 3 albums with selfies and 2 albums with portraits, which totals to 5 albums. The remaining 3 albums must contain a mix of selfies and portraits, but we don't need to know the exact distribution of these to find the total number of portraits and selfies.

Since each of the 3 albums with only selfies contains 9 pictures, the total number of selfies is:

\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And since each of the 2 albums with only portraits contains 9 pictures, the total number of portraits is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, the total number of portraits and selfies is:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50

2. For the second package:
   - 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"First, we need to determine the remaining amount Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set. 

The cost of the new bedroom set is $3000, and he sells his old one for $1000. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:

$3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining $2000 each month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst:

- Sally started with 25 red balloons.
- 40% of the red balloons burst, so \( 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \) red balloons burst.
- Therefore, \( 25 - 10 = 15 \) red balloons remained.

Next, let's calculate the number of yellow balloons that were released:

- Sally started with 12 yellow balloons.
- She released half of them, so \( 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \) yellow balloons were released.
- Therefore, \( 12 - 6 = 6 \) yellow balloons remained.

Now, let's consider the blue balloons:

- Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree.
- She added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, so \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) blue balloons were added.
- Therefore, she added 6 blue balloons to her remaining clutch.

Now, let's sum up the remaining balloons:

- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7 (unchanged)
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

The total number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

\[ 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 \]

So, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   
2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets a Personal Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher for a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8

Now, we calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by considering the scenarios where he does not get an extension:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability = 50% or 0.5

- **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
  - Probability = 50% * 60% = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3 or 30%

- **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Does Not Get a Personal Extension:**
  - Probability = 50% * 60% * 80% = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24 or 24%

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 = 1.04 \]

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, we need to consider the overlap and correct for it. The correct way to calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is to find the complement of the probability that he does not have to turn it in.

The probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework is:

\[ 0.5 + (0.5 * 0.4) + (0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8) = 0.5 + 0.2 + 0.24 = 0.94 \]

So, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:

\[ 1 - 0.94 = 0.06 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.06 * 100 = 6\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

6%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats already accounted for (graduates and faculty).
2. Subtract this number from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family.
3. Divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the math:

1. Total seats for graduates and faculty: 950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250 seats
2. Available seats for tickets: 6000 (total capacity) - 1250 (graduates and faculty) = 4750 seats
3. Tickets per graduate: 4750 (available seats) / 950 (number of graduates) = 5 tickets

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

5 tickets"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.
2. Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans. So, the number of medium-sized jelly beans he can eat is \(2 \times 75 = 150\).
3. Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean. Therefore, to find out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to multiply the number of medium-sized jelly beans by 3.

So, the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \(150 \times 3 = 450\).

Final numerical answer:
450"
"Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so she spends a total of:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

She is paid $15 per day, so for 3 days, she earns:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

She also has to pay $3 for parking each day, so for 3 days, her parking expenses are:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting her parking expenses from her earnings gives her net earnings:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses."
"Ted spends 3 books * $16/book = $48 on books.

"To determine how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it takes to place all the soda bottles and drop the candy.

First, let's find out how many soda bottles Richard will place. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he places a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of bottles is:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ bottles}
\]

The ""+1"" is because we need to count the bottle at the starting point.

Next, we need to calculate the total time it takes to place all the bottles and drop the candy. Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, and there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is:

\[
8 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds per interval} = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

\[

"To find out how much money Amor will have left after buying the cheese, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and then subtract that from the $50 she started with.

1. Calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
   - Price per pound of Parmesan cheese: $11
   - Pounds of Parmesan cheese bought: 2
   - Total cost of Parmesan cheese: $11 * 2 = $22

2. Calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
   - Price per pound of Mozzarella cheese: $6
   - Pounds of Mozzarella cheese bought: 3
   - Total cost of Mozzarella cheese: $6 * 3 = $18

3. Calculate the total cost of the cheese:
   - Total cost of cheese: $22 (Parmesan) + $18 (Mozzarella) = $40

4. Calculate the remaining money after buying the cheese:
   - Initial amount of money: $50
   - Total cost of cheese: $40
   - Remaining money: $50 - $40 = $10

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total amount of money he would have earned if he had continued working, and then determine how long it would take him to earn an equivalent amount of money with his new, higher income.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had continued working:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - He would have worked for 4 years without going to college.
   - Total amount earned without college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had worked and gone to college:**
   - With a college degree, Jim's income is tripled.
   - His new annual income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.
   - He would have worked for 4 years and gone to college for 4 years.
   - Total amount earned with college = ($75,000 * 4) - $200,000 (since he would have borrowed this amount).

4. **Calculate the net amount of money Jim would have earned if he had worked and gone to college:**
   - Total amount earned with college = $75,000 * 4 - $200,000 = $300,000 - $200,000 = $100,000.

5. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have lost by going to college:**
   - Total amount lost = Total amount borrowed + Total amount earned without college - Total amount earned with college.
   - Total amount lost = $200,000 + $100,000 - $100,000 = $200,000.

6. **Calculate how long it would take Jim to earn the equivalent amount of money with his new income:**
   - Jim's new annual income = $75,000.
   - Time to earn $200,000 = $200,000 / $75,000 = 2.67 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 2.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the required fabric pieces.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of each fabric piece will be:

Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:

Area of one piece = Length × Width
Area of one piece = 8 feet × 10 feet
Area of one piece = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:

Total area = 2 × 80 square feet
Total area = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

2. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. So, one-fifth of Monday's deliveries is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \). Therefore, on Tuesday, they delivered \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

3. On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. So, twice Tuesday's deliveries is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \). Therefore, on Wednesday, they delivered \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

Now, let's add up the deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:

- Monday: 425 letters
- Tuesday: 102 letters
- Wednesday: 209 letters

Total letters delivered Monday - Wednesday: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

The final numerical answer is:

For the pasta salad:
6 people * $6.00 per person = $36.00

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net loss: $21.5 - $11 = $10.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races (3):

Average loss per race: \(\frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5\)

So, Johnny's dad lost on average $3.5 per race that day."
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of people living in the cities of one country.
2. Multiply that number by the total number of countries in South America.

Step 1: Number of people in the cities of one country
- There are 5 cities in each country.
- Each city has 1000 people.
- Therefore, the number of people in the cities of one country is \(5 \times 1000 = 5000\).

Step 2: Total number of people in South America
- There are 26 countries in South America.
- Each country has 5000 people living in its cities.
- Therefore, the total number of people in South America is \(26 \times 5000 = 130000\).

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert Xavier's initial height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth over the summer:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total fraction of a day worked per day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

Let's go through each step:

1. The team worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. The team worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.

3. To convert \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day to hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):
   \[
   \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

4. The total number of hours worked by the team over 21 days is:
   \[
   21 \text{ days} \times 9 \text{ hours/day} = 189 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find the hours each painter worked:
   \[
   \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms and eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:

\[
2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:

\[ \text{Value after depreciation} = \text{Initial value} \times (1 - \text{depreciation rate})^{\text{number of years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"There are 50 books in total in the library.

"To calculate the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to determine how many tiles you will need and then multiply that by the cost per tile.

1. **Determine the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, you will need \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200\) tiles.

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

**Final Answer:**
The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%.

To find the increased amount, we calculate 60% of $120:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet per week. 

- For the twin beds: 4 sheets per bed * 4 beds = 16 twin sheets per week.
- For the king bed: 1 king sheet per week.

Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time, we can calculate the number of loads per week:

- Twin sheets: 16 sheets / 2 sheets per load = 8 loads per week.
- King sheets: 1 sheet / 1 sheet per load = 1 load per week.

So, the total number of loads per week is 8 (twin) + 1 (king) = 9 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is:

9 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 468 loads/year.

Final numerical answer:
468"
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

24 movies"
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous amount) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means:
2 * 50 (collected last year) = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by Imma's cats in one day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the daily consumption of cat food for one cat:
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams twice a day.
   - So, one cat consumes \(60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

2. Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption for all the cats is:
   - \(120 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
   - \(720 \, \text{grams} \div 360 \, \text{grams/day} = 2 \, \text{days}\).

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices.

Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add up the slices each person ate:
\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

Total slices eaten: 31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual charges:

1. Cast: $200
2. Visit: $300/hour for 30 minutes (which is half an hour, so we divide the hourly rate by 2)
   \[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]
3. Painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills
   \[ 4 \times 30 = 120 \]
4. Parking: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours
   \[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Now, we add all these amounts together:

\[ 200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \]

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to find out how many emails James doesn't need to respond to each day. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, we calculate 20% of 80 emails:

20% of 80 = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails

So, James doesn't need to respond to 16 emails each day. This means he needs to respond to the remaining emails:

80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

James responds to 64 emails each day. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\]

First, add 32 and 64:

\[32 + 64 = 96\]

Next, add 96 and 96:

\[96 + 96 = 192\]

Then, add 30:

\[192 + 30 = 222\]

Finally, add 25:

\[222 + 25 = 247\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

247"
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all 4 tests and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are:
- 100 on the first test
- 100 on the second test
- 100 on the third test
- 80 on the fourth test

The total score is:
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests (which is 4) to find the average:
380 / 4 = 95

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 

First, calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate:
20 pizzas * 70% = 20 * 0.70 = 14 pizzas

So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas, leaving:
20 pizzas - 14 pizzas = 6 pizzas

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so:
20 pizzas * 2 = 40 pizzas

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
40 pizzas * 80% = 40 * 0.80 = 32 pizzas

So, the football team ate 32 pizzas, leaving:
40 pizzas - 32 pizzas = 8 pizzas

Now, add the remaining pizzas from both groups:
6 pizzas (from the glee club) + 8 pizzas (from the football team) = 14 pizzas

Final numerical answer:
14 pizzas"
"Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. 

First, let's calculate the number of big coupons:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
\[ 700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:
\[ 1400 \times 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we add the costs together to find the total cost:
\[ 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Anthony spends a total of $245 on postage."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
2. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.
3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches remaining.
4. Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches in total.

Now, we need to find out how many meatballs are in the 6 meatball sub sandwiches that remained.

- Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs.
- 6 sub sandwiches * 4 meatballs per sub sandwich = 24 meatballs.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Mr. Hezekiah initially had 20 trucks, and each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver their load. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Since each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons} \]

**Final Answer: 300 tons**"
"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants, so he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

Since he needs 6 pounds of butter, he can take advantage of the promotion by buying 3 pounds at the full price and getting 3 pounds at half price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.

For the first 3 pounds, the cost is:
3 pounds * $4.00/pound = $12.00

For the next 3 pounds (at half price), the cost is:
3 pounds * ($4.00/pound * 0.5) = 3 pounds * $2.00/pound = $6.00

Adding these together, the total cost is:
$12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

Therefore, it will cost Dennis $18.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter."
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the actual number of guests attending the party is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Adding the rental fee and the cost for the additional guests gives us the total cost:

$125 + $126 = $251

The party will cost $251."
"Let's start by calculating how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80.

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money they each have left:

Maggie has $60 left, and Riza also has $60 left.

To find the total amount of money they have left together, we add their remaining amounts:

\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Therefore, the two of them have $120 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.
2. Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week.
3. There are 7 days in a week.

So, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315.

4. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Therefore, in a week, the first monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas/week}
   \]

5. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. So, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]
   Therefore, in a week, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas/week}
   \]

6. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a week, we subtract the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total number of bananas:
   \[
   315 \text{ bananas} - 70 \text{ bananas} - 98 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas}
   \]

7. Since the third monkey eats 147 bananas in a week, we can find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day by dividing the weekly total by 7:
   \[
   \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed all 500 pieces of that puzzle.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is:

250 (from the first puzzle) + 500 (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces.

750 pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we can determine the cost of a single rose by dividing $15 by 12:

\[ \text{Cost of one rose} = \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \]

Now, we can find the cost of 15 roses by multiplying the cost of one rose by 15:

\[ \text{Cost of 15 roses} = 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change she should receive is the difference between the amount she brought and the cost of the roses:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters."
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price and then add all the amounts together.

1. Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.00
2. Burger platters: 9 platters * $11 each = $99.00
3. Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.00

Now, we add all the amounts together:

$33.00 (milkshakes) + $99.00 (burger platters) + $30.00 (sodas) = $162.00

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul arrives (which we can assume is at the start) and the arrival time of the fourth train.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 minutes arrival + 20 minutes stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for 1/4 of the first train's stay time, which is 5 minutes (20 minutes / 4).
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 minutes arrival + 5 minutes stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Since Paul is waiting for the fourth train, he will wait for 145 minutes.

**Final Answer:**
145 minutes"
"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. Therefore, the number of toothpicks she still needs to collect is:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, which is $2000.

The price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, the selling price to his friend is:
\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and the friend paid $1800 for it. The discount is the difference between the original price and the selling price:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, one spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

72,000"
"Frankie's score was 15 better than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score was 90.

Twice Binkie's score is \(2 \times 90 = 180\).

Frankie's score is 15 more than this, so Frankie's score is \(180 + 15 = 195\).

Frankie's score: 195"
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, another 2 miles. So, he walked a total of 4 miles.

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

It took James 1 hour to reach the store."
"To calculate how much money Jenny saved, we need to compare the cost of buying 40 bananas (10 bunches, with 4 bananas per bunch) in two different ways: buying them individually and buying them in bunches.

1. **Buying individually:**
   - Cost per banana = $0.80
   - Total bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas
   - Total cost = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00

2. **Buying in bunches:**
   - Cost per bunch = $3.00
   - Total bunches = 10 bunches
   - Total cost = 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00

3. **Savings:**
   - Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
   - Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + H = 100 \)
2. \( H = S + 60 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, the growth rate per year is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the annual growth rate by 13:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

26 inches"
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of bike sold:

1. Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes:
   \[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ Trekking bikes} \]

2. 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes:
   \[ 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \text{ BMX bikes} \]

3. The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes. Since we know the number of Trekking and BMX bikes, we can find the number of MTB bikes by subtracting these from the total:
   \[ 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \text{ MTB bikes} \]

Now, let's calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

1. Earnings from Trekking bikes:
   \[ 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \]

2. Earnings from BMX bikes:
   \[ 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \] (since a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $500, so $500 / 2 = $250)

3. Earnings from MTB bikes:
   \[ 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \]

Finally, we add up the earnings from all the bikes to find the total earnings:
\[ 67,500 + 11,250 + 52,500 = 131,250 \]

Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"The farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the farmer makes a total of:

\[ 5 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{bales} \]

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the truck picks up a total of:

\[ 3 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 18 \, \text{bales} \]

To find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:

\[ 30 \, \text{bales} - 18 \, \text{bales} = 12 \, \text{bales} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

12 bales"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

Total class time per day = 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total class time for the week is:

Total class time per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on these days.

Extra learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week * (1/16) = 100 minutes/week

Now, we add the class time and the extra learning time to get the total learning time per week:

Total learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week + 100 minutes/week = 1700 minutes/week

To convert the total learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total learning time per week in hours = 1700 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 28.3333 hours/week

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

28.3333 hours/week"
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is 3 stories high, and each story is 24 feet. So, the initial height is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

The height after the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial weight of the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls to find the total area to be painted:

\[160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon:

\[240 \div 20 = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

Finally, we calculate the cost. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:

\[12 \times 12 = 144\]

So, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"Let's break down the scenario step by step:

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
2. She shakes 3 of them.
3. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas.
4. Her brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and picks a soda at random. There are 9 sodas left, and 2 of them are shaken.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second train is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour. 

After 3 hours, the distance covered by the first train is:
60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

And the distance covered by the second train is:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each has traveled:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

Final numerical answer:
270 miles"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps based on his working hours.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of days
- March has 31 days.
- From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

### Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works
- Billy takes 20% of the days off.
- 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
- Therefore, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps
- Billy can help 2 people per hour.
- He works 3 hours a day.
- So, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.
- Over 40 days, he helps 6 * 40 = 240 people.

**Final Answer:**
240 people"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the cars is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:
480"
"To find out how old Jeff is, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine Martha's age.
2. Use Martha's age to find Jeff's age.

First, we know that Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. So, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:
\[ \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20 \]

Next, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we can calculate Jeff's age as follows:
\[ \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each of the slides and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. 

First, let's calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day:
- 30 minutes for lunch
- 15 minutes for the first break
- 15 minutes for the second break

Total time per day = 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on breaks and lunch.

After 5 days, the total time spent on breaks and lunch is:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

Final numerical answer:
5 hours"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Amber ran 8 miles.
2. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran \(3.5 \times 8 = 28\) miles.
3. The total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles.

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Distance run by Ahito} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract that from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is: $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is: $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"If Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, then Ben is:

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   - She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - 40% of $100,000 is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \).

2. Calculate the total amount needed for 20 years of retirement:
   - She needs $40,000 per year for 20 years.
   - Total amount needed = \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \).

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:
   - She saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   - 20% of $100,000 is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \).

4. Calculate the number of years needed to save $800,000:
   - She saves $20,000 per year.
   - Number of years needed = \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \).

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement."
"Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut it into 4 equal parts first, and then each of those parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts.

First, we find the length of each of the 4 equal parts:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

Next, we take each of these 25 cm parts and divide them into 5 equal parts:
\[ \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total school population, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total school population by \( P \).

Given:
40% of \( P \) = 240 boys

We can write this as:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Now, to find the number of girls in the school, we subtract the number of boys from the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = P - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

Therefore, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total height of all the heels:

- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Now, we add these two totals together to get the overall total height of the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Next, we need to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\[\frac{18}{6} = 3\] inches.

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in the month of June, Soledad needs to determine how many miles she must hike per day.

First, we need to know the number of days in June, which is 30 days.

Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total distance she plans to cover each day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/walk} \times 2 \text{ walks/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles she needs to hike per day to cover 9,300 miles in 30 days. We do this by dividing the total distance by the number of days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 310 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we subtract the distance she plans to hike from the distance she needs to hike:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

60 miles/day"

"Let's break down the information given:

- Anna's initial budget: $16
- Amount spent: $4
- Amount left: $2
- Number of books bought: 2
- Cost of each book: \( x \)

First, we need to find out how much money Anna spent on the books. We can do this by subtracting the amount she has left from her initial budget:

\[ 16 - 4 - 2 = 10 \]

So, Anna spent $10 on the 2 books. Since both books cost the same amount, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x = 10 \]

To find the cost of each book, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost $5.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

To find the number of students this year, we calculate 20% of 50 and add it to the original number of students.

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year is:

50 (last year's enrollment) + 10 (increase) = 60

"Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry, so Dior took 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 hours (since it's mentioned ""over 4 hours longer,"" we can assume the minimum overage is 1 hour).

Now, let's add up the time they all took to do their chores:

Amalia: 4 hours
Megan: 6 hours
Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"John visits his parents twice a month, and each visit takes 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph. Since it's a round trip, we need to calculate the one-way distance and then double it for the total distance.

First, we calculate the one-way distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since it's a round trip, we double the one-way distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:
\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{560} \]"

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each. So, in 10 hours, each of them produces:
\[ 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ toys} \]
Since there are two such workers, the total production from these two workers is:
\[ 60 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 120 \text{ toys} \]

The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each. So, in 10 hours, each of them produces:
\[ 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ toys} \]
Since there are two such workers, the total production from these two workers is:
\[ 40 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Adding the production of all four workers together, we get:
\[ 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the total number of toys produced by the five workers is:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Therefore, the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, and Kory's dog is 60 pounds. So, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many stickers Seth had initially.

1. Let's say Seth had \( x \) stickers initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{x}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the rest to Kris, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) stickers.
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. So, Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total.
6. Since Kris received \( \frac{x}{4} \) stickers from Luis, we can set up the equation: \( \frac{x}{4} = 16 \).
7. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies each day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the distance by the daily distance:

\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we calculate its speed as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate its speed as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
2. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
3. Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
4. Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, Sarah painted \( 30 - C \) eggs.
5. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = (30 - C) + 12 \).

Now, let's solve for \( C \):

\[ C = 30 - C + 12 \]
\[ 2C = 42 \]
\[ C = 21 \]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs. Now, we can find out how many eggs Sarah painted:

\[ 30 - C = 30 - 21 = 9 \]

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted by Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah is 56. We can write this as:

\[ A + A + C + (30 - C) = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be put into a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together, we get:

\[ 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be made into logs:

80% of 80 feet = 0.80 * 80 = 64 feet

Now, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs can be made from 64 feet:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, John can cut 5 planks:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

If he sells each plank for $1.2, then the total amount he makes is:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

So, John makes $96."
"Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother earns $5000 * 2 = $10000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (brother) = $15000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns $15000 * 2 = $30000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (brother) + $30000 (mother) = $45000.

Total amount of money they all have together: $45000."
"Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach and that this distance is 2 miles, we can determine her speed on the beach. 

First, we calculate her speed on the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{\text{Distance on the beach}}{\text{Time on the beach}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we calculate the time she spends walking on the sidewalk, which is 1 mile:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on the sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on the sidewalk}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to get the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."
"Jane has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so she has saved a total of:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

She wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks needed to save $28 is:

\[ \frac{28}{4} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

   \(3 \times 7 = 21\) blue birds

2. For the 2 trees each with 4 blue birds:
   \(2 \times 4 = 8\) blue birds

3. For the 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
   \(1 \times 3 = 3\) blue birds

Now, we add all these together:
\(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob had:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

2. Next, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. If he loses 10 marbles from his current 36 marbles, he will have:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would allow Donny to drink the mixture after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees for him to drink it.

The total volume of the mixture is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces. The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs of water:

\[
\text{Temperature of the mixture} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5}
\]

We know that this temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, we simplify the left side of the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Next, we multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Then, we subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug of water must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the mixture.

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks.
- So, the total number of cows added is \(20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows}\).

Now, let's calculate the number of chickens added:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks.
- So, the total number of chickens added is \(10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens}\).

Next, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Total number of cows after three weeks: \(50 + 420 = 470\)
- Total number of chickens after three weeks: \(20 + 210 = 230\)

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
- Total number of animals: \(470 + 230 = 700\)

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

Now, let's apply the 10% discount:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, let's find out how many bagels Russell gets in 4 packs:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels/pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, to find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

Each single bagel will cost:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the information given:
   - If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then \(x\) potatoes make 18 scoops.
   - We can write the proportion as \(\frac{3}{2} = \frac{x}{18}\).

4. Solving for \(x\):
   - Cross-multiply to get \(3 \times 18 = 2 \times x\).
   - This simplifies to \(54 = 2x\).
   - Dividing both sides by 2, we get \(x = 27\).

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats in those 60 days.

1. For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
   \(3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}\)

2. For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
   \(5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}\)

3. Adding the eggs from both periods:
   \(90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}\)

4. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
   \(\frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}\)

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans. Since there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Step 3: The number of blue jellybeans is the total number of jellybeans minus the total number of green and red jellybeans:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"

"To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total parts of the ratio.
2. Calculate the number of men and women on the bus.
3. Subtract the number of women who alight from the bus.

Step 1: The ratio of men to women is 5:9, so the total parts of the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14.

Step 2: The total number of passengers is 84. To find the number of men and women, we can divide the total number of passengers by the total parts of the ratio and then multiply by the respective parts of the ratio.

- Number of men = (5/14) * 84 = 30
- Number of women = (9/14) * 84 = 54

Step 3: If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales.
2. Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day from the bouquet sales.
3. Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets per day.
4. Sum the total number of sunflowers sold from both the individual sunflowers and the bouquets over 3 days.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Sunflowers sold per day from individual sales:**
   - Each sunflower costs $2.
   - Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day.
   - Number of sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

2. **Bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Number of bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.

3. **Sunflowers sold from bouquets per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day = 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.

4. **Total sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = Sunflowers from individual sales + Sunflowers from bouquets = 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers.

5. **Total sunflowers sold over 3 days:**
   - Total sunflowers sold over 3 days = 97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers.

Therefore, after 3 days, Faraday was able to sell a total of 291 sunflowers."
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with $100 if each rock costs $5.

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5 \text{ per rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells, which is 60% of his inventory.

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each.

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times \$7 = \$84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. The loss is the difference between his initial investment and the revenue.

\[ \text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16."
"To find out how many days it will take for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scene and then sum them up.

1. For large-sized picture scenes:
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes = 45 / 5 = 9 days.

2. For medium-sized picture scenes:
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes = 36 / 6 = 6 days.

3. For small-sized picture scenes:
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized scenes = 49 / 7 = 7 days.

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning with the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

First, we know the probability of winning with the first ticket is 20%, or 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is:

\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Next, we need to find the probability that both tickets are winners. Since the events are independent, we multiply the probabilities of each event:

\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is:

\[ \boxed{12\%} \]"

"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they would need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total required:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Carla has 8 identical octuplets.
2. 3/4 of them are dressed in purple, and 1/4 in blue.

First, calculate the number of octuplets dressed in each color:
- Purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we know that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. So, calculate the number of octuplets wearing bows:
- Blue-wearers wearing bows: \( 2 \)
- Purple-wearers wearing bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

Now, the total number of octuplets wearing bows is:
- Total wearing bows: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)

We need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The number of purple-wearers wearing bows is 2, and the total number of bow-wearers is 4. The probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sells half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left.
4. He then sells another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. One-fourth of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. After selling 10 square meters, he has 30 square meters left.
6. He then sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earns 30 * $3 = $90 from the remaining land.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $170 after selling all his unused land."

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs that were found:

Lamar: 5 eggs
Stacy: 10 eggs
Charlie: 8 eggs
Mei: 4 eggs

Total found: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. So, we calculate 60% of 400:

\[0.60 \times 400 = 240\]

Adding this to the 400 apartments gives us the total number of apartments in the third complex:

\[400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

Now, we can find the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is:

\[1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections}\]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\]

"Let's break down the information given:

- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
- A 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
- An 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old produces as \(x\). Therefore, an 8-year-old produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits

Adding these up:

\[50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2550\]

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2550."

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) using the second piece of information:
\[ Y = B + 7 \]

Now, we can substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( R \) and \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]
\[ Y = B + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

Final answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:
   \[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

2. Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \).

3. After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with:
   \[ 15 - x \]

4. According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. So we can write the equation:
   \[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

5. Simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[ 15 - x = 12 \]

6. Solving for \( x \):
   \[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

7. Now, we know that both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. So, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
   \[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The mural uses 12 pints of paint in total.
2. Half of the mural is yellow, so 6 pints of the paint are yellow.
3. The remaining paint is equally divided among red, white, and purple.

Since half of the mural is yellow, the other half is divided equally among the three remaining colors (red, white, and purple). Therefore, the remaining half of the mural is 6 pints (12 pints / 2 = 6 pints).

Since the red, white, and purple paint are equally divided, we divide the 6 pints by 3:

6 pints / 3 = 2 pints

So, 2 pints of red paint were used.

2 pints"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:

Area of one bedroom = 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

Total area of bedrooms = 4 * 240 square feet = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

Area of the living room = 5 * 240 square feet = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we can find the total area of the house by adding the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

Total area of the house = 960 square feet + 1200 square feet + 1000 square feet = 3160 square feet

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so she counts \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs of clouds.

On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so she counts \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs of clouds.

On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so she counts \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs of clouds.

On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so she counts \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs of clouds.

To find the total number of clouds she counted across all five days, we add the number of clouds from each day:

\(3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\)

At the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 puffs of clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \).
   - Therefore, the special box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special box:**
   - The special box costs $12 and contains 120 pods.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods you can get for $1:**
   - If each pod costs $0.10, then for $1, you can get \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Calculate the number of dishwashing cycles you can run with 10 pods:**
   - Since you use 1 pod per cycle, 10 pods will allow you to run 10 cycles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, he gets:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, so he uses:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   The amount he pays is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   After paying, he has:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]

4. He then triples his money. The amount he has is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Tripling this amount gives:
   \[
   400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has $1200, the number of 5 dollar bills he has is:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}

"In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals = 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after using 45% of the 5-inch piece on Monday, and then calculate how many days he can use 20% of the remaining chalk before it falls below 2 inches.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk.
   - He used 45% of it on Monday.
   - 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.
   - Remaining chalk = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

2. **Determine the chalk usage per day:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day.
   - 20% of the remaining 2.75 inches = 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day.

3. **Calculate the number of days before the chalk is recycled:**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to go from 2.75 inches to less than 2 inches.
   - The chalk decreases by 0.55 inches each day.
   - The chalk will be less than 2 inches when the remaining chalk is 2 inches or less.
   - The chalk will be 2 inches after (2.75 - 2) / 0.55 = 0.75 / 0.55 ≈ 1.36 days.
   - Since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, we round up to the next whole day, which is 2 days.

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to determine how many girls and boys are on varsity.

- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) boys.

Now, we can calculate the number of students not on varsity:

- Girls not on varsity: \( 12 - 4 = 8 \)
- Boys not on varsity: \( 12 - 3 = 9 \)

Adding these together gives us the total number of students not on varsity:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James has 30 teeth.
2. The dentist drills 4 of them.
3. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Now, we need to find out how many teeth the dentist has fixed in total. The dentist has fixed the teeth by both drilling and capping, so the total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist has fixed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the dentist has fixed 50% of James' teeth.

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus purchased:

Total gallons of milk = 4000 gallons
Cost per gallon = $3.5

Total cost = 4000 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $14,000

Next, we need to determine how much of the milk had passed the expiry date:

Fraction of milk that passed the expiry date = 2/5

Gallons of milk that passed the expiry date = 2/5 * 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons

Now, we calculate the refund amount based on the cost per gallon:

Refund per gallon = $3.5
Total refund = 1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5,600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5,600."
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost per book.
2. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
3. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the cost per book is:
\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars per book} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:
\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob distributes the money equally among the 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school:
\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs built per hour**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs melting per 15 minutes**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the net loss of snowballs per hour is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs.

3. **Net gain of snowballs per hour**: Therefore, the net gain of snowballs per hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs.

4. **Target number of snowballs**: Jay wants to have 60 snowballs.

5. **Time to reach 60 snowballs**: To find out how many hours it will take to get 60 snowballs, we divide the target number of snowballs by the net gain per hour: \(60 \div 12 = 5\) hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age when Digimon came out and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since Digimon is celebrating its 20th anniversary, it came out 20 years ago.

2. We know that John is currently 28 years old. If we go back 20 years, John would have been 8 years old (28 - 20 = 8).

3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim must have been half of that age, which is 4 years old (8 / 2 = 4).

4. Now, to find out how old Jim is now, we add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon came out to Jim's age at that time. So, Jim is now 24 years old (4 + 20 = 24).

Therefore, Jim is 24 years old now."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \(12 - 28 = -16\) bandages, but since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered another bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 16 = 34\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \(50 \times 2 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they had \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\) bandages.

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information. The discrepancy is \(109 - 78 = 31\) bandages, which means they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than our initial calculation.

So, if they ended with 78 bandages after starting with the initial amount and going through the usage and ordering, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Initial amount} - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78 \]
\[ \text{Initial amount} + 89 = 78 \]
\[ \text{Initial amount} = 78 - 89 \]
\[ \text{Initial amount} = -11 \]

This negative value indicates an error in the interpretation. Let's recheck the initial amount by working backwards from the end of the third day:
\[ 78 + 25 - 100 = 53 \]
\[ 53 - 50 = 3 \]
\[ 3 + 28 = 31 \]
\[ 31 - 50 = -19 \]

The correct approach is to recognize that the initial amount should be:
\[ 78 + 25 - 100 + 28 - 50 = 31 \]

So, they started with 31 bandages on the first day.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings from her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**

Since there are 4 weeks in April and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings from her hourly rate.**

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

For 24 days, her total earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. So, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2400 \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees
- 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140 trees

3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining 8 gallons of root beer were shared equally among the 3 people.

So, each person gets 8 / 3 gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
8 / 3 gallons

To provide the answer in a separate line:
Each person gets 2.67 gallons (rounded to two decimal places)."
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 4x = 32 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
2. Calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes to get the final answer.

Let's start with step 1:

1. One-third of the fish have red stripes:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]
   So, there are 22 fish with red stripes.

2. Calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes:
   \[
   66 - 22 = 44
   \]
   So, there are 44 fish remaining.

3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish:
   \[
   \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
   \]
   So, there are 20 fish with blue stripes.

4. Add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:
   \[
   22 + 20 = 42
   \]

Therefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, she had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so she loses 4 colors. Now she has \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which means she uses up \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. So, she loses 3 more colors.

Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors she has left is \(22 - 3 = 19\).

Final numerical answer:
19"
"Mattison is 60 inches tall.

His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the height of the house is:
\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so the height of the first floor is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches high, the height from the first floor to the second floor is:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:
\[ 240 \text{ inches} \]

Final numerical answer:

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells, which is:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \text{ shells} \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found the remaining shells, which is:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \text{ shells} \]

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

The total miles walked by all four dogs per day is the average miles per dog multiplied by the number of dogs. So, we have:

\[ \text{Total miles} = \text{Average miles per dog} \times \text{Number of dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 3 \, \text{miles/dog} \times 4 \, \text{dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 12 \, \text{miles} \]

We know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- First dog: 1 mile
- Second dog: 4 miles
- Third dog: 3 miles

So, the total miles for the first three dogs is:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the miles needed for the last dog, we subtract the total miles for the first three dogs from the total miles for all four dogs:
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 12 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 4 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we calculate the loan amount John gets by mortgaging his home. The house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that value.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan amount John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount for this purpose.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we calculate the leftover money after paying off the debts.

\[ \text{Leftover money} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is $40,000."
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

So, the total weight of the tunas is:
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, if a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram:

128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.00

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64.00 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the buying price from it.

1. Calculate the selling price:
   - Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the buying price.
   - Buying price = $72.
   - Selling price = \( 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \).

2. Perform the multiplication:
   - \( 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \).

3. Calculate the profit:
   - Profit = Selling price - Buying price.
   - Profit = $99 - $72 = $27.

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum them up.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\).

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \(4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}\).

Now, we sum up the water removed at each setting:
\[3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}\]

The total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw, we can follow these steps:

- They filled up 10 packs of balloons.
- Each pack contains 30 balloons.

So, the total number of balloons is:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, we subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons:

- They had 12 balloons left at the end of the afternoon.

So, the number of balloons thrown is:
\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons} \]

Therefore, the number of balloons they threw is:

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

The combined capacity of both schools is:
\[ 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:

\[ \text{Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month} = \text{Total Amount} - \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bus starts with 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 people enter the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]
3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop enter the bus. So, the number of people entering at the second stop is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]
   Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
   \[
   60 + 30 = 90
   \]
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubles. So, the number of people on the bus after the third stop is:
   \[
   90 \times 2 = 180
   \]
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the bus, we subtract the current number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:
   \[

1. **Initial Cost of One Visit:**
   - The initial cost of one visit is $2.

2. **Cost Increase After 5 Years:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years.
   - A 150% increase means the cost is now 250% of the original cost (100% + 150% = 250%).
   - 250% of $2 is \(2 \times 2.5 = $5\).

3. **Number of Visits Per Year:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.

4. **Total Visits in the First 5 Years:**
   - In 5 years, she visits \(5 \times 3 = 15\) times.
   - The cost for these visits is \(15 \times 2 = $30\).

5. **Total Visits in the Next 3 Years:**
   - In the next 3 years, she visits \(3 \times 3 = 9\) times.
   - The cost for these visits is \(9 \times 5 = $45\).

6. **Total Cost Over 8 Years:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years.
   - Total cost = $30 + $45 = $75.

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all visits to the museum."
"There are 4 grades, and each grade has 10 students who can try the escape room. So, there are a total of 4 grades * 10 students/grade = 40 students who can try the escape room.

If 8 students can try the escape room at a time, then the number of groups needed is 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups.

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time for all groups to try the escape room is 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount Ali has to pay John:
$80 + $20 = $100

Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The longer piece, being 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

"A basic manicure starts at $35 and a pedicure starts at $40. 

First, let's calculate the total cost for both services before the discount:
\[ \text{Total cost before discount} = \$35 + \$40 = \$75 \]

The salon offers a 20% discount if you get both services. So, we need to calculate 20% of $75:
\[ \text{Discount} = 20\% \times \$75 = 0.20 \times \$75 = \$15 \]

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost before discount to get the total cost after the discount:
\[ \text{Total cost after discount} = \$75 - \$15 = \$60 \]

So, Karen would pay a total of $120."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from all the magazines and then determine the number of magazines based on the total issues.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \(3 \times 12 = 36\) issues

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \(6\) issues

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues

Now, we add up all the issues:
\(36 + 6 + 24 = 66\) issues

Since each magazine sends a certain number of issues, the total number of magazines is the total number of issues divided by the number of issues per magazine. However, the question asks for the total number of magazines, not the number of issues per magazine. So, we need to consider the number of magazines as given in the problem statement:

- 3 magazines with 12 issues each
- 1 magazine with 6 issues
- 1 magazine with 24 issues

So, the total number of magazines is:
\(3 + 1 + 1 = 5\)

50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Now, we divide the total by the number of quizzes, which is 9:

630 / 9 = 70

So, Sally's mean score is 70."
"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had.

1/4 of 20 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"Walter initially bought 60 apples.

1. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
   \]
   So, he ate 24 apples.

2. The remaining apples after eating are:
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
   \]

3. He gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 36 = \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
   \]
   So, he gave his sister 9 apples.

4. The remaining apples after giving some to his sister are:
   \[
   36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
   \]

5. He sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each:
   \[
   27 \times 3 = 81
   \]

Therefore, Walter received $81."
"Let's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels are 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To find \( x \), we can solve the equation by isolating \( x \):

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ x = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding any stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas (which is 6000 km) Michael has covered. We do this by dividing the distance Michael has traveled by the total distance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make grape juice, which is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is \(6 + 30 = 36\) grapes.
4. The mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used for the pies is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.
5. Therefore, the total number of grapes at the beginning is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the grapes used for the pies, which is \(36 + 48 = 84\) grapes.

Final numerical answer:
84"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers: 82
Number of sick teachers: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Teachers at school = 79 + 9
Teachers at school = 88

So, 88 teachers were at school that day."
"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of pasta per week:**
   - Bud uses 1 box of pasta per week.
   - The cost of one box of pasta is $1.00.
   - Therefore, the weekly cost of pasta is $1.00.

2. **Cost of cheddar cheese per week:**
   - Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese per week.

3. **Cost of gruyere cheese per week:**
   - Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.
   - Therefore, the cost of gruyere cheese per week is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

4. **Total weekly cost:**
   - Adding up the costs, the total weekly cost is \(1 + 3 + 6 = 10\) dollars.

5. **Total yearly cost:**
   - Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total yearly cost is \(10 \times 52 = 520\) dollars (assuming there are 52 weeks in a year).

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is **$520**."
"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time over the 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean, so for 80 classrooms:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total available time over the 5 days.**

An 8-hour day is equivalent to:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total available time is:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 480 \text{ minutes/day} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

The total time required to clean all classrooms is 1200 minutes, and this needs to be done over 5 days, so the average time spent cleaning per day is:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{5 \text{ days}} = 240 \text{ minutes/day} \]

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

The percentage of the day spent cleaning is:
\[ \left( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, spent cleaning classrooms is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold:

- Middle shelves: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: \(20\) books
- Top shelf: \(15\) books

Total books per bookcase: \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs:

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. So, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:

Rose will sell the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, five dozens will have:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs, we divide 60 by 3:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Skyler has 100 hats in total.
2. Half of the hats are red, so the number of red hats is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \) hats.
3. After removing the red hats, the remaining number of hats is \( 100 - 50 = 50 \) hats.
4. \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \) hats.
5. The rest of the hats are white. So, the number of white hats is \( 50 - 30 = 20 \) hats.

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"Archie buys beef jerky that costs $18.00 per bag but there's a $3.00 discount, so the cost per bag is:

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Each bag contains 30 sticks of jerky, so the cost per stick is:

$15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):

$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

Each stick of jerky will cost 50 cents."
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass.
2. Determine how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test.
3. Calculate how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test to meet the 70% requirement.

First, let's find the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct and the total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests, we have:

\[ \text{Total questions} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]
\[ \text{Questions needed to pass} = 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ \text{Questions correct on first test} = 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the total of 77 questions:

\[ \text{Questions needed on second test} = 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get \(\boxed{35}\) questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade."
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes is 96.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{96} \]"

"Brendan started with 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This left him with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles. He then found 3 more, so he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. However, he found out that one of them was a bead and not a marble, so he got rid of it. Therefore, Brendan ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

7 marbles"
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into smaller steps based on the given ratios.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 customers, 1 car is sold.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \(15 \times 2 = 30\) customers.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 30 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes into the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 30 customers, Jason needs \(30 \times 25 = 750\) telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"Brianna's family has 4 people, so they have 4 flashlights (one for each person).

There are 8 rooms in the house, and for each room, there are 2 flashlights. So, the total number of flashlights for the rooms is:
8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights

In total, combining the flashlights for the people and the rooms, they have:
4 (personal) + 16 (room) = 20 flashlights

For the candles, half the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since there are 8 rooms, half of them is 4 rooms.

For the 4 rooms with small candles:
4 rooms * 4 small candles/room = 16 small candles

For the 4 rooms with medium candles:
4 rooms * 5 medium candles/room = 20 medium candles

In total, they have:
16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles

So, when the lights go out, Brianna's family is using:
20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56 candles and flashlights."
"Mitchell buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each, so the total number of chips is:

2 bags * 55 chips/bag = 110 chips

Each person gets 22 chips."
"John takes 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube. 

The second and third sides each take twice that long, so:
- Second side: 5 minutes * 2 = 10 minutes
- Third side: 5 minutes * 2 = 10 minutes

The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first side, so:
- Fourth side: 5 minutes / 2 = 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 5 minutes / 2 = 2.5 minutes

The sixth side is not specified, but since all 6 sides are required to have a fully solved Rubik's cube, we can assume it takes the same time as the first side, which is 5 minutes.

Adding all these times together:
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 5 = 35 minutes

The Rubik's cube takes 35 minutes."
"Given that there were 20 helmets, we can determine the number of robots and footballs based on the information provided.

"To return home, Phineas Frog will need to cover a total distance of 200 yards, with half of that distance on land and the other half in water. This means he will hop 100 yards on land and swim 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Hopping speed on land: 20 yards per minute
- Distance to hop: 100 yards
- Time to hop = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Swimming speed in water: 10 yards per minute
- Distance to swim: 100 yards
- Time to swim = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

- Total time = Time to hop + Time to swim = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home."
"Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks for his project. Popsicles come 8 to a box. 

First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs:
\[ \frac{56 \text{ sticks}}{8 \text{ sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for 7 boxes is:
\[ 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00 \]

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. 

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). Therefore, the main phone costs \( 2x \).

Given that the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10. Since there are four additional phones, the total cost for the additional phones is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones gives us the total cost of the whole phone plan:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."

"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training:

His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, he is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is:
\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words he needs to speak. There are 10 pages, and each page has 450 words, so the total number of words is:
\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time in minutes is:
\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw on these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining days) = 500 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 500."
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** 3 times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** 4 times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** Half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the number of kernels that popped during the cooking process:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[\frac{40}{4} = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{210}

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
- Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32\]

Now, we can solve for \(R\):

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]
\[12 + R = 32\]
\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and apply it to the boat's value step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost on the way, so let's denote the number of beakers lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 31 - 29 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the tables:
   - Each table has 4 legs.
   - James is putting together 4 tables.
   - Total legs = 4 tables * 4 legs/table = 16 legs.

2. Calculate the total number of screws needed for all the legs:
   - Each leg needs 2 screws.
   - Total screws needed = 16 legs * 2 screws/leg = 32 screws.

3. Calculate the number of screws left over:
   - James has 40 screws.
   - Screws used = 32 screws.
   - Screws left over = 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

So, James will have 8 screws left over."
"There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first, so it has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Adding the eggs from both baskets together: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

Final numerical answer:
30"
"Alexandra raises $430.
Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raises $300.
Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total amount of money they all raised, we add up the amounts:

$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"Aaron ran half the distance that Vanessa ran, so he ran 2 miles. Since Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, the time it took Aaron to run 2 miles is the same as the time it would take Vanessa to run 1 mile. 

Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes, so Vanessa would take 16 minutes to run 1 mile. 

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so the time it took her to complete her part of the race is:

16 minutes/mile * 4 miles = 64 minutes

Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line needed.
Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total amount of line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.
The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, so the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the weekly earnings, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. Number of reservations per night: 6
2. Meals per reservation: 2
3. Cost per meal: $5
4. Cost of wine per reservation: $5
5. Number of days the restaurant is open per week: 2

First, calculate the total cost per reservation:
- Cost of meals per reservation: 2 meals * $5 = $10
- Cost of wine per reservation: $5
- Total cost per reservation: $10 + $5 = $15

Next, calculate the total cost for all reservations per night:
- Total cost per night: 6 reservations * $15 = $90

Finally, calculate the total cost for the week:
- Total cost per week: $90 * 2 days = $180

So, the restaurant makes $180 a week if they are open 2 days a week."
"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost price per watermelon.
2. Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost price per watermelon.**

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.**

A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price. So, the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is currently 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

**8**"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

1. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes.
2. Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes.

An hour has 60 minutes.

- The number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.
- The number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour."
"To find out how much Mark paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor, then add these two amounts together.

1. Calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount:
   - Original cost of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80%
   - Discounted cost: $400 * (1 - 0.80) = $400 * 0.20 = $80

2. Calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor:
   - Labor rate: $50 per hour
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: $50 * 3 = $150

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of radiator + Labor cost
   - Total cost = $80 + $150 = $230

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230."
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. Each chicken has 2 legs.
2. Each cow has 4 legs.
3. The total number of animals is 20.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can set up the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm.

Final numerical answer:
5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices.
2. Divide the total number of slices by the number of people.

First, we calculate the total number of slices:
7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry and his 3 friends, so 4 people in total):
56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

Each person can have 14 slices."
