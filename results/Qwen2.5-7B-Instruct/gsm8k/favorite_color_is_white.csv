"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Janet has each day, which is 16 eggs.

Next, we need to account for the eggs Janet uses. She uses 3 eggs for her breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, the total number of eggs used each day is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs to find out how many eggs she has left to sell:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Since she sells each egg for $2, the total amount of money she makes from selling the remaining eggs each day is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount in white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

So, in total, it takes:
2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts.

**Total bolts needed: 3**"
"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (initial purchase price plus repairs) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The initial purchase price of the house is $80,000, and the repairs cost $50,000. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. Therefore, the new value of the house is the original value plus 150% of the original value.

The increase in value due to repairs is:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Thus, Josh's profit is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, calculate the total distance he runs in one session:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs in a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day. Since each chicken is given 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken consumes:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Given that Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed for the entire flock in a day is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and the afternoon:

- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To determine the total cost of 16 glasses, we need to account for the discount on every second glass. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. Identify the cost of the first glass and the discounted cost of the second glass.
   - The cost of the first glass is $5.
   - The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

2. Determine the pattern for the cost of the glasses.
   - The cost of the glasses will alternate between $5 and $3.
   - For 16 glasses, there will be 8 glasses at $5 and 8 glasses at $3.

3. Calculate the total cost.
   - The total cost for the 8 glasses at $5 is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) dollars.
   - The total cost for the 8 glasses at $3 is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 16 glasses is \(40 + 24 = 64\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{64}
\]"
"To determine the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we start by defining the number of sheep each city has in terms of the number of sheep Seattle has.

1. Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep in Seattle.
2. According to the problem, Seattle has 20 sheep, so \( S = 20 \).

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
3. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, the number of sheep in Charleston, \( C \), is:
   \[
   C = 4 \times S = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

Then, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
4. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, the number of sheep in Toulouse, \( T \), is:
   \[
   T = 2 \times C = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

Finally, we find the total number of sheep in all three cities by summing the sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
5. The total number of sheep is:
   \[
   T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together is \(\boxed{260}\)."
"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into several steps and calculate the time for each step.

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.4 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Add the time for the Windows update restart:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.6 \times 200 = 120 \text{ GB}\).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Sum up all the times:**
   - Time to download the first 80 GB: 40 minutes.
   - Time for the Windows update restart: 20 minutes.
   - Time to download the remaining 120 GB: 60 minutes.
   - Total time: \(40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \text{ minutes}\).

The total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down the problem into several steps and calculate the distance he travels in each segment of his journey.

1. **Initial Drive to the Turning Point:**
   John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]
   So, John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.

2. **Return Trip:**
   John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he does not cover any distance during this time.
   \[
   \text{Distance covered in standstill traffic} = 0 \, \text{miles}
   \]
   After the standstill traffic, he drives for the next 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at a speed of 30 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance covered in the next 0.5 hours} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
   \]
   After this, he drives for the remaining time of the 4 hours, which is \(4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5\) hours, at a speed of 80 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance covered in the last 1.5 hours} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]
   Adding up all the distances covered during the return trip:
   \[
   \text{Total distance covered in the return trip} = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Distance from Home:**
   Since John was 180 miles away from home when he turned around and he has covered 135 miles on his return trip, the distance he is from home at the end of 4 hours is:
   \[
   \text{Distance from home} = 180 - 135 = 45 \, \text{miles}
   \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours worked.

1. **Calculate the regular pay:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = \( 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \).

2. **Calculate the overtime pay:**
   - Overtime is paid at 1.2 times the regular hourly rate.
   - Overtime rate = \( 1.2 \times \$10 = \$12/\text{hour} \).
   - Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).
   - Overtime pay = \( 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \).

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay.
   - Total earnings = \$400 + \$60 = \$460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are \(\boxed{460}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is reduced by 30% from the second month's downloads.
   \[
   \text{Third month downloads} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month.
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is \(\boxed{366}\)."

\[ 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 \]

Therefore, the total cost is \(\boxed{694}\)."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost:**
   - The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.

2. **Annual Costs:**
   - The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

3. **Annual Revenue:**
   - Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons.
   - Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
   - Therefore, the annual revenue is \( 7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \).

4. **Net Annual Profit:**
   - The net annual profit is the annual revenue minus the annual cost.
   - Net annual profit = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5.

5. **Break-Even Point:**
   - To find the break-even point, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of years.
   - The total net profit after \( n \) years is \( 7.5n \).
   - We need \( 7.5n \geq 90 \).

6. **Solving for \( n \):**
   \[
   7.5n \geq 90
   \]
   \[
   n \geq \frac{90}{7.5}
   \]
   \[
   n \geq 12
   \]

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{12}\) years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]
   We know that after the orange house, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6 \implies x = 18
   \]

So, the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance. This leaves:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

students remaining. Next, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. We calculate:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \]

So, 4 students enrolled in jazz dance. This leaves:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

students who enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit at the end of the month, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: \( 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125 \)

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: \( 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096 \)

Now, we compare the final values:
- Jewelry: $5,125
- Electronic Gadgets: $8,096

The electronic gadgets will yield a higher value at the end of the month. The profit from the electronic gadgets is the final value minus the initial value:

Total distance covered by each train = 230 miles

The final numerical answer is:
230 miles"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to break down her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we add her annual earnings from both jobs to find her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of eggs Claire uses in one day. Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning.

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she uses in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs per day by 7:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Now, we calculate the number of eggs she uses in 4 weeks. We multiply the number of eggs per week by 4:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to hike the 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the time already spent hiking:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining time to hike the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining distance to hike:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of \(\boxed{6}\) miles per hour."
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
\]
After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:
\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]
The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

Now, we add the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink together. The total volume of the mixture is:
\[
9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters}
\]

"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Determine the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
3. Calculate the number of years ago Raymond's son was born based on Samantha's current age.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond's current age is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Raymond had his son at the age of 23. Therefore, the age difference between Raymond and his son is:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years} \]
This means Raymond's son is currently:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \text{ years old} \]

To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract his current age from Samantha's current age:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

Thus, Raymond's son was born \(\boxed{2}\) years ago."

- The next 2 customers each buy 2 DVDs, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) DVDs.
- The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so that's \(0\) DVDs.

Adding these together, the total number of DVDs sold is \(3 + 4 + 0 = 7\).

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time the candle burns.
2. Determine how much the candle melts in that time.

First, let's find the total time the candle burns. The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The time difference between these two times is:
\[ 5:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. Therefore, in 4 hours, the candle will melt:
\[ 2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm} \]

So, the candle will be \(\boxed{8}\) centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price. This is because a 25% discount means Kyle paid 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price.

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can express this relationship with the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, we perform the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \(\boxed{26}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the boxes of pizza.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[\frac{17}{8.50} = 2\].

So, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item and then sum these costs.

First, we calculate the total cost for the shorts:
\[
3 \text{ pairs of shorts} \times \$16.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 16.50 = \$49.50
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the pants:
\[
3 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$22.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 22.50 = \$67.50
\]

Then, we calculate the total cost for the shoes:
\[
3 \text{ pairs of shoes} \times \$42 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 42 = \$126
\]

Finally, we sum the costs of all the items:
\[
\$49.50 + \$67.50 + \$126 = 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = \$243

"First, we need to determine the total number of servings Cynthia will consume over 60 days. Since she eats one serving of ice cream every night, the total number of servings in 60 days is:

\[ 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons required is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total distance of the trip: 60 miles.
2. Determine the distance traveled before the first stop: 20 miles.
3. Determine the distance remaining after the first stop: \(60 - 20 = 40\) miles.
4. Determine the distance of the trip from the first stop to the end: 15 miles.
5. Calculate the distance traveled between the first and second stops by subtracting the distance from the second stop to the end from the remaining distance after the first stop: \(40 - 15 = 25\) miles.

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the cost of the other pair of high heels is twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

The problem also states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"To determine Allen's age 10 years from now, we start by defining the current ages of Darrell and Allen using the given ratio and total age.

Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]
To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]
Now that we have \(x = 9\), we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x\) into the expression for Allen's age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]
Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]
Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"First, let's determine the guesses of each friend:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is \(40 + 20 = 60\).
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\), so 25% more than 80 is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Calculate the daily time spent on each dog:
   Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.

2. Calculate the total daily time spent on all dogs:
   John has 10 dogs, so the total daily time is:
   \[
   10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. Calculate the weekly time spent on all dogs:
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly time is:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of his dogs each week is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + G = 110 \]

We are also given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, which can be expressed as:
\[ G = S + 30 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( G \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. We can express this mathematically as follows:

\[
\text{Aaron's jewels} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Raymond's jewels} + 5
\]

Substituting the number of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\text{Aaron's jewels} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. We can express this as:

\[
\text{Siobhan's jewels} = \text{Aaron's jewels} - 2
\]

Substituting the number of Aaron's jewels:

\[
\text{Siobhan's jewels} = 25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, the number of jewels Siobhan has is:

\[
\boxed{23}

"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. 

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This can be calculated by dividing 60 by 4:

\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets at $15 each, so the total amount from selling the lego sets is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games at $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the amount of money he spent on the video games and the amount left can be used to find out how much he originally had before buying the video games. The equation for the money spent and left is:
\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]
Since he has $5 left, the calculation confirms that:
\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]
and
\[ 35 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]
This confirms the money spent and left is consistent.

Since John spent all his money on the video games and has $5 left, it means he did not have any lego sets left to sell. Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running, then use the formula for speed: speed = total distance / total time.

First, let's find the total distance John runs in a week. According to the problem, John runs 60 miles a week.

Next, let's calculate the total time John spends running. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much time on each of the other two days. So, the time he runs on the second and third days is each 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.

The total time spent running is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate his speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John's running speed is \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"First, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds. We know that Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour and that her skipping speed is half her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period. Therefore, the time spent running is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
and the time spent walking is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance she travels while running and walking. The distance traveled while running is:
\[ 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
and the distance traveled while walking is:
\[ 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance traveled in six hours:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, we can calculate the age of Ben's iPhone as follows:
   \[
   \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, we can calculate the age of Brandon's iPhone as follows:
   \[
   \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, we need to determine the throwing distance of the gold javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone. According to the problem, when Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. 

The normal throwing distance without the gemstone is 400 feet. Therefore, with the gemstone, the throwing distance is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon. The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. Therefore, Polly can stand 1200 feet away from the dragon and still be able to throw the javelin to hit it.

To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{200}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the initial number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine the calorie content of the entire 300g bag of chips. Since the bag has 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left in your daily target after you have already consumed 1800 calories. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, so the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of the bag of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since the entire 300g bag contains 1250 calories, the number of grams you can eat per calorie is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat with 200 calories is:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, the number of pounds needed for 20 candles is:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the supplies:**
   - The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \) articles.
  \[
  \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
  \]
  So, on Tuesday, she wrote:
  \[
  5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, she wrote:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[
26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[
\boxed{104}
\]"
"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at the coffee shop.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before using any at work is the sum of the initial notes and the notes from the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes remaining is:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 \]

According to the problem, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{800}

"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, a 4-foot long wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from a 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. Since the building has 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ 42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars per week from selling eggs."
"To determine how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to know the distance he travels from 1 to 4 PM and then use that distance to calculate the time it takes to travel back at 6 mph.

First, calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM:
- Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
- He travels from 1 to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours.

The distance \( D \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \]
\[ D = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ D = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the time it takes to travel back at 6 mph:
- The distance back is the same, 30 miles.
- The speed on the return trip is 6 mph.

The time \( T \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ T = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]
\[ T = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} \]
\[ T = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, it takes Tom \(\boxed{5}\) hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. We subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys need to be removed to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys."
"First, let's calculate the revenue earned on Thursday.

- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each:
  \[
  6 \times 60 = 360 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  4 \times 40 = 160 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Total revenue on Thursday:
  \[
  360 + 160 = 520 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue earned on Friday.

- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- No truck tires are repaired, so the revenue from truck tires is:
  \[
  0 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Total revenue on Friday:
  \[
  480 + 0 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. The higher revenue day is Thursday, with $520, and Friday, with $480.

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
\[
520 - 480 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the mechanic earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more on Thursday."
"First, let's determine the number of adopted kittens the Doubtfire sisters brought home. They adopted 7 kittens.

Next, we need to find out how many kittens Patchy, the first cat, has had. According to the problem, Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Therefore, the number of kittens Patchy has had is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

The problem also states that Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens. 

Now, we can find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has by adding the adopted kittens, the kittens from Patchy, and the kittens from Trixie:
\[ 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 \]

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

5. **Calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck:**
   \[
   \text{Maximum number of boxes} = \left\lfloor \frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}} \right\rfloor
   \]

6. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{1245}{15} = 83
   \]

7. **Since the result is an integer, the maximum number of boxes is:**
   \[
   \left\lfloor 83 \right\rfloor = 83
   \]

Thus, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is:
\[
\boxed{83}

"First, we need to calculate the 25% fee on the final bill of $40.00. 

The 25% fee is calculated as:
\[ 40.00 \times 0.25 = 10.00 \]

Adding this fee to the original bill:
\[ 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \]

Next, we add the $3.00 delivery fee:
\[ 50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00 \]

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip:
\[ 53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00 \]

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is:
\[ \boxed{57.00} \]"
"To find the total number of raspberries on the bush, we need to add the raspberries in the clusters to the individual raspberries.

First, calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters:
\[ 6 \text{ clusters} \times 20 \text{ raspberries per cluster} = 120 \text{ raspberries} \]

Next, add the number of individual raspberries:
\[ 120 \text{ raspberries} + 67 \text{ individual raspberries} = 187 \text{ raspberries} \]

So, the total number of raspberries is:
\[ \boxed{187} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25
- Sour oranges: 2

To find the number of unripe oranges, we calculate 20% of 25:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \]

Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:
\[ \text{Good oranges} = 25 - (\text{Bad oranges} + \text{Unripe oranges} + \text{Sour oranges}) \]
\[ \text{Good oranges} = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) \]
\[ \text{Good oranges} = 25 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Good oranges} = 17 \]

So, the number of good oranges is 17."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials and the construction of the brooch. Janet pays $500 for the materials and $800 for the construction. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of insuring the brooch. Janet pays 10% of the total cost of the materials and construction to get it insured. To find 10% of $1300, we multiply $1300 by 0.10:

\[ 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Now, we add the cost of the insurance to the total cost of the materials and construction to find the total amount Janet paid:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

Therefore, the total amount Janet paid is:

\[
\boxed{1430}
\]"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the annual pension for the first 20 years.
2. Calculate the additional pension she becomes entitled to after 20 years.
3. Sum the two amounts to find her total annual pension after 30 years.

**Step 1: Annual Pension for the First 20 Years**

Marcy receives an annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years.

**Step 2: Additional Pension After 20 Years**

Starting after 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension is the total amount she has received over the first 20 years.

The total amount received over the first 20 years is:
\[ 50,000 \times 20 = 1,000,000 \]

The additional pension she becomes entitled to is 5% of this amount:
\[ 0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000 \]

**Step 3: Total Annual Pension After 30 Years**

The total annual pension after 30 years is the sum of the regular annual pension and the additional pension:
\[ 50,000 + 50,000 = 100,000 \]

Thus, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years is:
\[ \boxed{100000} \]"
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and calculate each part separately.

1. **Initial Monthly Charge:**
   - The initial monthly charge is $140.

2. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Total cost for the first half of the year:
     \[
     6 \text{ months} \times \$140 \text{ per month} = 6 \times 140 = \$840
     \]

3. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The charge for the second half of the year is 10% less than the initial monthly charge.
   - Calculate 10% of $140:
     \[
     0.10 \times 140 = 14
     \]
   - Subtract this from the initial monthly charge to find the reduced monthly charge:
     \[
     140 - 14 = 126
     \]
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Total cost for the second half of the year:
     \[
     6 \text{ months} \times \$126 \text{ per month} = 6 \times 126 = \$756
     \]

4. **Total Amount Paid for the Year:**
   - Add the costs of the first and second halves of the year:
     \[
     \$840 + \$756 = \$1596
     \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is \(\boxed{1596}\)."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) and then use that to find out the total distance she can travel with a full tank.

First, we calculate the car's fuel efficiency:
- Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas.
- Therefore, the car's fuel efficiency is:
  \[
  \text{Fuel efficiency} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
  \]

Next, we use the fuel efficiency to find out how far Sophia can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons:
- Since the car can travel 25 miles per gallon, with a full tank of 12 gallons, the total distance is:
  \[
  \text{Total distance} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
  \]

Thus, Sophia can drive \(\boxed{300}\) miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time he spends on TV and reading in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/time} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school sends \(5 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 10 \text{ players}\).

2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team).
   - Therefore, each school sends \(2 \text{ coaches}\).

3. Since there are 4 schools, we need to multiply the number of players and coaches per school by 4.
   - Total number of players: \(10 \text{ players/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 40 \text{ players}\).
   - Total number of coaches: \(2 \text{ coaches/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 8 \text{ coaches}\).

4. Adding the total number of players and coaches gives us the total number of people:
   - Total number of people: \(40 \text{ players} + 8 \text{ coaches} = 48 \text{ people}\).

Thus, the total number of people sent by all the schools is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of rubies. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:
\[ \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140 \]

Next, we need to find the number of emeralds. The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds as the rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
\[ \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:
\[ \text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 \]

Thus, the total number of gems in the chest is:
\[ \boxed{595} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. According to the problem, there are twice as many boys as girls. Since there are 60 girls, the number of boys is:

Next, we need to find the total number of students at the school. This is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:
\[ 120 + 60 = 180 \]

The problem states that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 5:
\[ \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of teachers is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. Therefore, the total amount of money she receives from her allowance over 8 weeks is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This total amount is the sum of the money she started with and the money she received from her allowance. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, the amount of money Bailey started with is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week.

- From Monday to Friday, she teaches 5 classes each day. So, the total number of classes from Monday to Friday is \(5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}\).
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33 \text{ classes}\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week. Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students is \(33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}\).

Judy charges $15.00 per student. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes in a week is \(495 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[20 + 40 = 60\]

So, Kelian has to read 60 instructions in total."
"To determine how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the revenue from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie slice for $3.
- Tommy sells 43 brownie slices.

\[
\text{Revenue from brownies} = 43 \times 3 = 129 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake slice for $4.
- Tommy sells 23 cheesecake slices.

\[
\text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 23 \times 4 = 92 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the revenues from both brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount of money Tommy raises:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 129 + 92 = 221 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Tommy raises is \(\boxed{221}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ 5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$150 \text{ per cell phone} = \$750 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total interest charged. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ 5 \times 2\% \times \$150 = 5 \times 0.02 \times \$150 = \$15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela needs to pay is the sum of the original cost and the interest:

\[ \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Since Shiela will pay this amount in 3 months with no additional interest on the installment payments, we divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment:

\[ \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay \(\boxed{255}\) each month for 3 months."
"First, let's round the prices of the flowers to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16 square feet.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

1. **Level 4 (Top level):** 16 square feet
2. **Level 3:** 
   \[
   \text{Level 3} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ square feet}
   \]
3. **Level 2:** 
   \[
   \text{Level 2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ square feet}
   \]
4. **Level 1 (Bottom level):** 
   \[
   \text{Level 1} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ square feet}
   \]

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \text{ square feet}
\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[
\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is:
\[
\boxed{7.5}

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then find out how many bags are needed for that amount.

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \( 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \).

2. **Determine the number of bags needed for the first 180 days:**
   - One bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} \approx 1.636 \).

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

**Final numerical answer:**
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as \( D \) pounds. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, the amount of laundry Sarah does is \( 4D \) pounds. We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 4D = 400 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]

So, David does 100 pounds of laundry. Next, we need to determine how much laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, the amount of laundry Raymond does is:

\[ \frac{400}{2} = 200 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 200 - 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the two different package options.

- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
- Cost difference: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6.00}\) by buying 18 flowers at the better price."

"First, let's determine how much water each of the two girls received. Each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water. Therefore, the amount of water each girl received is:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:

\[
4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we need to account for the amount of water the boy received, which is 6 liters. Adding this to the water the girls received, the total amount of water distributed so far is:

\[
8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. To find out how much water is left, we subtract the total amount of water distributed from the initial amount:

\[
24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the amount of water left is:

\[
\boxed{10}

Next, we need to find out how many thorns there are in total. Since each rose has 8 thorns, we can calculate the total number of thorns as follows:

\[ 75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns} \]

Therefore, the total number of thorns is:

\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

According to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games, so we can write the equation:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which can be expressed as:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won \(\boxed{15}\) games."

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald combined is 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold \(\boxed{8000}\) copies."
"First, let's determine how many guests are expected to actually attend the party. Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up. This means that 3/4 of the invited guests will attend.

Calculate the number of guests who will attend:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12
\]

Next, we need to find out how many gift bags Christina will need. She plans to give 0.75 gift bags per attending guest. Therefore, we multiply the number of attending guests by 0.75:
\[
12 \times 0.75 = 9
\]

Each gift bag costs $2. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of gift bags by the cost per gift bag:
\[
9 \times 2 = 18
\]

Thus, Christina will spend:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how much potato salad each child will eat. Since a child eats half as much as an adult, and an adult eats 10 pounds, a child will eat:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults. With 20 adults, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is:

\[ 20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the children. With 5 children, the total amount of potato salad for the children is:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts for the adults and the children gives the total amount of potato salad needed:

\[ 200 + 25 = 225 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic is:

\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To determine the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of pets Cindy has.
2. Use the information to find the number of pets Marcia has.
3. Use the information to find the number of pets Jan has.
4. Sum the number of pets each person has.

First, we know that Cindy has 4 pets:
\[ \text{Cindy's pets} = 4 \]

Next, we know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy:
\[ \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Then, we know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia:
\[ \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Now, we sum the number of pets each person has:
\[ \text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"To determine Jackson's age, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the four kids step by step.

1. Let's denote the ages of Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James as \( A \), \( J \), \( C \), and \( M \) respectively.
2. We know from the problem that James is 10 years old, so \( M = 10 \).
3. James is 1 year younger than Corey, so \( C = M + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \).
4. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so \( A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \).
5. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so \( A = J + 5 \). Since \( A = 9 \), we can substitute to find \( J \):
   \[
   9 = J + 5 \implies J = 9 - 5 = 4
   \]

Thus, Jackson is \(\boxed{4}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Since Lee now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. If Gerald's speed improved by 10%, his new time will be 90% of his original time. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times 0.90 = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Let's start by defining the variables and using the information given in the problem.

1. Let \( D \) be the number of dogs.
2. Let \( C \) be the number of cats.
3. Let \( R \) be the number of rabbits.

From the problem, we know:
- The number of dogs \( D = 60 \).
- The number of cats is twice the number of dogs, so \( C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \).
- The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, so \( R = D + C - 12 \).

Now, substitute the values of \( D \) and \( C \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[ R = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168. \]

Next, we need to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood. This is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348. \]

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

The total number of students is 200. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Since the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:
\[
200 - 80 = 120
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. The problem states that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[
120 - 80 = 40
\]

Thus, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[
\text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when cooked into sauce. Therefore, the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking.

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking**: Since the sauce made is 32 ounces and it is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes in 4 cans is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of tomatoes Freda used is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, after the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam in the next 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars from the line took an exit, so they did not have to drive through the traffic jam.

The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. After the traffic jam, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).

This total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the next 15 minutes. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Thus, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, the total number of potted plants she already has is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, the total number of potted plants she will give away is:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we can find out how many potted plants Mary will have left after giving some away. She received 18 new potted plants yesterday, so the total number of potted plants she has before giving any away is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

After giving away 40 potted plants, the number of potted plants she will remain with is:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \( 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell \( 60 + 10 = 70 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all four friends:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read from all his textbooks:

- Science textbook: 4 pages
- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages/day

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days. 

**6 pages/day**"
"John drinks water with each of his three daily meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and one before bed, but he switches to soda for dinner on weekends. 

- On weekdays (Monday to Friday):

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we start by understanding the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover the entire 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[
\text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Next, we calculate the time to cover 42 miles by multiplying the time it takes to cover 1 mile by 42:
\[
\text{Time to cover 42 miles} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city is:
\[

"First, let's determine the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

- The inner length of one box is \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches.
- The inner width of one box is \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches.
- The inner height of one box is \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches.

The inner volume of one box is calculated by multiplying these inner dimensions together:
\[
3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 2 \text{ inches} = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

3 \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Thus, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\)."
"Let's break down the information given and calculate the total hours Frankie spent watching TV each day.

- **Monday and Tuesday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode each night.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Thursday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Friday**: Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
  \[
  2 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Total hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday**:
  \[
  2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours}
  \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week. Therefore, the hours he watched on Wednesday can be calculated as:
\[
7 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we can determine the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode:
\[
\frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes}
\]

Thus, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \). This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which is \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To determine the final cost of 10 gallons of gas after the cashback reward, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons of gas.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback.**

The price per gallon is $3.00. Therefore, the cost for 10 gallons is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons of gas.**

The cashback is $0.20 per gallon. Therefore, the cashback for 10 gallons is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final cost.**

The final cost is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \):
     \[
     L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23
     \]

2. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is:
     \[
     40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000
     \]

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming her salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her new salary is:
     \[
     30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92
     \]

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   - Adrien's new salary: $56,000
   - Lylah's new salary: $43,076.92
   - Total salary:
     \[
     56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92
     \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\)."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Since there are 30 sheets of paper in each pad, he uses \(2 \times 30 = 60\) sheets of paper per week.

To find out how many sheets he uses in a month, we need to know the number of weeks in a month. Assuming an average month has about 4 weeks, Miguel uses \(60 \times 4 = 240\) sheets of paper every month.

"First, let's determine the number of fruits each person brought.

Morisette brought:
- 5 apples
- 8 oranges

Kael brought twice the amount of apples and half the number of oranges than Morisette. Therefore:
- Kael brought \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- Kael brought \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
- Morisette's total fruits: \(5 + 8 = 13\)
- Kael's total fruits: \(10 + 4 = 14\)

Adding the total fruits from both Morisette and Kael:
\[13 + 14 = 27\]

So, the total number of fruits they have is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down her sleep schedule day by day.

1. **Monday:**
   Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday each day.
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours per day}
   \]
   Therefore, for both Tuesday and Wednesday:
   \[
   6 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:**
   Sadie slept 1 hour more than the 6 hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   \[
   6 + 1 = 7 \text{ hours per day}
   \]
   Therefore, for the four days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday):
   \[
   7 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total sleep for the week:**
   Adding up the hours from each day:
   \[
   8 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday and Wednesday)} + 28 \text{ (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday)} = 48 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week is:
\[

"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

1. Calculate the distance Rosie runs in the first 3 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. Determine the remaining time after the first 3 hours:
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours}
   \]

3. Calculate the distance Rosie runs in the remaining 4 hours at 5 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. Add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie runs in 7 hours:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is \(\boxed{50}\) miles."
"Jennie put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. To find out how many letters she stamped, we calculate one-third of 60:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters. These 20 letters are now part of the pile of already-stamped letters. We know that after adding these 20 letters, the pile of already-stamped letters contains 30 letters. Therefore, the number of letters that were already in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie added the 20 letters is:

\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began was \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

Initially, Julia had 0 spoons. After buying a package of \( x \) spoons, she had \( x \) spoons. Her husband then gave her a package of 5 spoons, so the total number of spoons she had became \( x + 5 \).

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons left is \( x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 \). According to the problem, after using 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, which means he bought \(38 + 6 = 44\) fish sausages. 

To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages together: \(38 + 44 = 82\).

So, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages."
"To determine the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we start by identifying the number of friends each of them has.

First, we know that Lily made 50 friends. We can express this as:
\[ \text{Number of friends Lily has} = 50 \]

Next, we are told that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. Therefore, the number of friends Amy has is:
\[ \text{Number of friends Amy has} = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we add the number of friends each of them has:
\[ \text{Total number of friends} = \text{Number of friends Lily has} + \text{Number of friends Amy has} = 50 + 70 = 120 \]

Thus, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to first find the cost of each item and then calculate the total cost based on the quantities he is buying.

1. **Determine the cost of a watermelon:**
   - Each pepper costs $15.
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   \[
   \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of an orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon.
   \[
   \text{Cost of an orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for the watermelons:**
   - Dillon is buying 4 watermelons.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for the peppers:**
   - Dillon is buying 20 peppers.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   - Dillon is buying 10 oranges.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is \(\boxed{880}\)."
"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by the doctors with the patients in a day:
\[ 500 \text{ patients} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient} = 12000 \text{ minutes} \]
Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
\[ 12000 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 200 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the cost to the hospital for the doctors' time:
\[ 200 \text{ hours} \times \$150/\text{hour} = \$30000 \]

Now, we calculate the revenue from the patients:
\[ 500 \text{ patients} \times \$200/\text{hour} = \$100000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the cost from the revenue:
\[ \$100000 - \$30000 = \$70000 \]

The hospital's profit from these visits is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"To determine how many elves are left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of elves, which is 60.
2. Calculate how many elves quit after children vomit on them. A third of the elves quit, so we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
   Therefore, 20 elves quit, and the number of elves remaining is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. After that, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of elves left is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Joseph's expenditure in May.
2. Calculate Joseph's expenditure in June.
3. Add the expenditures of May and June to find the total.

Step 1: Joseph's expenditure in May is given as $500.

Step 2: Joseph's expenditure in June is $60 less than his expenditure in May. Therefore, we subtract $60 from $500:
\[ 500 - 60 = 440 \]
So, Joseph's expenditure in June is $440.

Step 3: To find the total expenditure for May and June, we add the expenditures of these two months:
\[ 500 + 440 = 940 \]

Thus, Joseph's total expenditure for those two months is \(\boxed{940}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of rides each person took.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ rides} \]

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ rides} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rides for both Pam and Fred combined:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \text{ rides} \]

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is:
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]

So, the total number of tickets they used that day is:

"To determine how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of miles Walt walked on Monday.
   - Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.

2. Calculate the number of miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
   - Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday.
   - Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday = \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.

3. Let the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday be \(x\).

4. According to the problem, the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles.
   - Therefore, the equation for the total mileage is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (Monday)} + 24 \text{ (Tuesday)} + x \text{ (Wednesday)} = 41
     \]

5. Simplify the equation to solve for \(x\):
   \[
   4 + 24 + x = 41
   \]
   \[
   28 + x = 41

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the items before any additional fees or tips:

- The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\).
- The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\).
- The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\).

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items:
\[15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\]

Next, we need to add a 20% delivery fee to this total. The delivery fee is calculated as:
\[20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\]

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost of the items gives:
\[20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\]

Finally, Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip. Adding the tip to the total with the delivery fee gives:
\[24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00\]

Therefore, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:

"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he answered in each test and then find out how many questions he did not complete.

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark answered in the first test:
- The test consisted of 75 questions.
- Mark's rate is 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he answered in the first test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark answered in the second test:
- The test consisted of 100 questions.
- Mark's rate is 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he answered in the second test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Finally, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is the sum of the questions left incomplete in both tests:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"

According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that the number of blue gumballs \( B \) is 12. Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is \( 70 \).

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars are available. We know the total number of cars and the number of automatic and manual cars.

1. Total number of cars: 20
2. Number of automatic cars: 12
3. Number of manual cars: 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of the total number of cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \). According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \). Additionally, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
To find \( Q \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]
So, the number of queens is 100. The number of baby bees is \( 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \). The number of worker bees is \( 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

Thus, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the non-food items are the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. The milk and eggs are considered food items.

The cost of the non-food items is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

The total cost of the non-food items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the food items (milk and eggs):
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

The total cost of the food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items including tax to get the total cost:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He currently has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so the total number of clients will be:

\[3 + 5 = 8\]

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths required. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. Therefore, for 8 clients, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is:

\[8 \times 2 = 16\]

And the total number of packs of cloths needed is:

\[8 \times 1 = 8\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the bleach and cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cloths costs $5. So, the total cost for the bleach is:

\[16 \times 2 = 32\]

And the total cost for the cloths is:

\[8 \times 5 = 40\]

Adding these together gives the total expenses:

\[32 + 40 = 72\]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[92 - 72 = 20\]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

First, we know that John has 10 hectares of pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Next, since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to determine how many harvests he can make in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of harvests per year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year by multiplying the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests per year:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Johnny has a lego set with 500 pieces.
2. He has another lego set with 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece set. So, the number of pieces in this set is:
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500
   \]
3. He also has another lego set with 1/4 the number of pieces of the 500 piece set. So, the number of pieces in this set is:
   \[
   \frac{500}{4} = 125
   \]

Now, we need to find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up by summing the pieces from all three sets:
\[
500 + 1500 + 125
\]

Let's add these numbers step by step:
\[
500 + 1500 = 2000

   - Bees leaving: 30 bees

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: All the bees that left in the first 6 hours and the next 6 hours, minus those that returned in the previous 6 hours.
   - Bees that left in the first 12 hours: \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) bees
   - Bees that returned in the first 12 hours: \( 15 \) bees
   - Bees returning in the last 6 hours: \( 90 - 15 = 75 \) bees

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is \( \boxed{75} \)."
"To determine how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the tickets.
2. Add the change received to the total cost to find the amount given.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets:
- The cost of an adult ticket is $12.
- The cost of a child ticket is $10.
- Therefore, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is:
  \[
  12 + 10 = 22 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, the number of Facebook friends James has is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how long the winner will be waiting for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, we convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

For Steve:
- Distance: \(3 \text{ miles} = 3 \times 5280 = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Speed: \(440 \text{ feet per minute}\)
- Time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)

For Tim:
- Distance: \(2 \text{ miles} = 2 \times 5280 = 10560 \text{ feet}\)
- Speed: \(264 \text{ feet per minute}\)
- Time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

Thus, the winner (Steve) will be waiting for the loser (Tim) for \(\boxed{4}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the number of tires Shawnda inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For the bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people had both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For the tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people had all their tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For the unicycle: A unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person had their tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we sum the total number of tires inflated:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost in cents is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

Next, we calculate the total cost of these cookies:
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10 \text{ per cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Now, we determine how much change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. The raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's calculate step by step:

1. After Dave ate 14 fries, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).
2. After the seagull ate 7 fries, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
3. After the pigeons ate 9 fries, the remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
4. Let the remaining fries before the raccoon ate be \( y \). The raccoon ate two-thirds of \( y \), so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3}y \). After the raccoon ate, the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3}y \).
5. The ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, \( \frac{1}{3}y - 1 = 5 \). Solving for \( y \), we get \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \), so \( y = 18 \). Therefore, before the raccoon ate, there were 18 fries.
6. Since \( y = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \), we have \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 18 \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( x - 30 = 54 \), so \( x = 84 \).

The total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( \boxed{84} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on classes each week:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
  - He has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
  - Total hours per day: \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
  - Total hours for 3 days: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
  - He has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
  - Total hours per day: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
  - Total hours for 2 days: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from all the days in one week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours (MWF)} + 8 \text{ hours (TT)} = 17 \text{ hours per week} \]

Next, we multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks in the semester:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
\boxed{272}

"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches and then convert the total length to feet.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \( 300 \times 4 = 1200 \) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - First, convert the length of each baguette to inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
     - Each baguette is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) inches long.
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \( 60 \times 24 = 1440 \) inches.

Next, we sum the total lengths in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches (rolls)} + 720 \text{ inches (croissants)} + 1440 \text{ inches (baguettes)} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, convert the total length from inches to feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
\[ \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is \(\boxed{280}\) feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly banana requirement for each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

1. **Monkeys:**
   - Monthly requirement: 200 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 200 \times 2 = 400 \) bananas

2. **Gorillas:**
   - Monthly requirement: 400 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \) bananas

3. **Baboons:**
   - Monthly requirement: 100 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 100 \times 2 = 200 \) bananas

Next, we sum the total number of bananas required for all the apes over 2 months:

\[
400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Thus, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. The football field is 100 yards long, and Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Therefore, the distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 2 \times 100 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back), and she does this 34 times. Therefore, the distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 2 \times 40 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday:**
   - On Monday, the depth of the water is 17 feet.
   - On Tuesday, the depth of the water is 7 feet more than on Monday.
   - Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
     \[
     17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the depth of the water on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{48}{3} \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
     \]

The depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is \(\boxed{16}\) feet."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of fish that Locsin caught.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Next, we calculate the total number of fish each person caught.

Anakin's total:
\[ 10 \text{ (starfish)} + 6 \text{ (sea horses)} + 3 \text{ (clownfish)} = 19 \text{ fish} \]

Locsin's total:
\[ 5 \text{ (starfish)} + 3 \text{ (sea horses)} + 5 \text{ (clownfish)} = 13 \text{ fish} \]

Finally, we add the totals to find the combined number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
\[ 19 \text{ (Anakin's total)} + 13 \text{ (Locsin's total)} = 32 \text{ fish} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( P_0 = 20 \) dollars
   - Increase rate: 20% every two months

2. **Express the increase rate as a decimal:**
   - 20% = 0.20

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   - Number of two-month periods = \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)

4. **Use the formula for compound interest to find the final price:**
   - The formula for the final price after \( n \) periods of increase is:
     \[
     P_n = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n
     \]
   - Here, \( P_0 = 20 \), \( r = 0.20 \), and \( n = 18 \).

5. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
   \]
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

6. **Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):**
   - Using a calculator:
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366
     \]

7. **Multiply the result by the original price:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32
   \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{787.32}\) dollars."

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer and its accessories and then subtract this from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items Elvira is purchasing:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Mouse: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Next, we sum the costs of the items that are not included in the computer price:
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, we add these costs together:
\[ 157 + 74 + 102 = 333 \]

We then add this total to the cost of the computer:
\[ 1090 + 333 = 1423 \]

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost from her budget:

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[ \boxed{77} \]"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, the total number of eggs needed is:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   S = 2B
   \]
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   B + S + 4 = 28
   \]
   Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
   \[
   B + S = 24
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( B + S = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation. Replace \( S \) with \( 2B \) in the second equation:
\[
B + 2B = 24
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3B = 24
\]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[
B = 8
\]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[
S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

So, Seth is \(\boxed{16}\) years old."
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, we can calculate how much money Jimmy has as follows:

   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75
   \]

3. **Cost of the pants:**
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket.
   \[
   \text{Average cost} = \frac{\text{Cost of the hat} + \text{Cost of the jacket}}{2} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

4. **Total cost of the uniform:**
   Sum the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150
   \]

Thus, the total cost of each uniform is \(\boxed{150}\)."

   Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
   \[
   \text{Granny Red's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **Sally Two's age:**
   Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
   \[
   \text{Sally Two's age} = 16 + 3 = 19 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, we sum the ages of all four birds:
\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Sally Thirtytwo's age} + \text{Sally Four's age} + \text{Granny Red's age} + \text{Sally Two's age}
\]
\[
\text{Total age} = 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 41

"First, we need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment for all of Jessica's debts. The minimum payments are as follows:
- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Adding these together gives the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. Therefore, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 + 0.5 \times 1000 = 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars/month} \]

To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to peel one potato. It takes him about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato. It takes him about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 300 seconds to minutes:
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time it takes to peel the potatoes and the time it takes to cut the potatoes:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[ \boxed{95} \]"
"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost of lemons and sugar.
   - The profit is given by the total revenue minus the total cost: \( \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - C \).
   - Therefore, \( 25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C \).

2. **Express the total revenue in terms of the number of glasses sold:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of glasses sold.
   - Each glass is sold for $0.50.
   - Total revenue = \( 0.50x \).

3. **Express the total cost in terms of the number of gallons made:**
   - Let \( g \) be the number of gallons made.
   - Each gallon costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) dollars.
   - Total cost = \( 5g \).

4. **Relate the number of glasses sold to the number of gallons made:**
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, \( x = 20g \).

5. **Substitute \( x \) in the profit equation:**
   - \( 25 = 0.50(20g) - 5g \).
   - Simplify the equation: \( 25 = 10g - 5g \).
   - \( 25 = 5g \).

6. **Solve for \( g \):**
   - \( g = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \).

7. **Calculate the total cost of lemons and sugar:**
   - Total cost = \( 5g = 5 \times 5 = 25 \) dollars.

8. **Determine the cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Total cost of lemons = \( 3g = 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

Thus, the amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, we need to determine the number of Chinese participants in the race. We know the total number of Asians is 240, and out of these, 80 are Japanese. Therefore, the number of Chinese participants is calculated as follows:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

So, there are 160 Chinese participants. We are given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Thus, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total spent on rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Amount given to daughter and wife**:
   \[
   \text{Amount given to daughter} = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount given to wife} = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total given} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

8. **Final remaining amount**:
   \[
   \text{Final remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:
\[
\boxed{350}

"To determine the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of crabs Bo has.
2. Use Bo's number of crabs to find out how many crabs Monic has.
3. Use Monic's number of crabs to find out how many crabs Rani has.
4. Sum the number of crabs each person has.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. So, we can write:
\[ \text{Bo's crabs} = 40 \]

Next, we know that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Monic has as follows:
\[ \text{Monic's crabs} = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Then, we know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Rani has as follows:
\[ \text{Rani's crabs} = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, we sum the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs:
\[ \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[ \boxed{122} \]"
"To determine how much Lloyd earned over the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate his earnings for the first week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the first week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours worked} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate his earnings for the second week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the second week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours worked} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both weeks to find the total earnings:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings for the first week} + \text{Earnings for the second week} = 50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned \(\boxed{130}\) dollars for the first two weeks."
"The total number of students who voted is 80. The winner got \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the votes. To find the number of votes the winner received, we calculate:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
80 - 60 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to follow these steps:

1. Define the number of white carnations as \( w \).
2. According to the problem, the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, the number of pink calla lilies is \( 5w \). We know from the problem that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   5w = 200
   \]
3. Solve for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
   \]
   So, the number of white carnations is 40.
4. The number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is:
   \[
   4w = 4 \times 40 = 160
   \]

Thus, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{160}\) red roses by 5 pm."
"Let's denote the current ages of Jean and Mark as \( J \) and \( M \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark:
\[ J = M + 2 \]

2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. Since Jan is currently 30 years old, two years ago Jan was 28 years old. Therefore, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of 28:
\[ M - 2 = \frac{28}{2} + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = 14 + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = 19 \]
\[ M = 21 \]

Now that we know Mark's current age is 21, we can find Jean's current age using the first equation:
\[ J = M + 2 \]
\[ J = 21 + 2 \]
\[ J = 23 \]

So, Jean is \(\boxed{23}\) years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time for the faster team.**

Each of the four runners on the faster team runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Therefore, the total time for the faster team is:
\[
4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total time for the slower team.**

The slower team's runners run the 400 meters in the following times:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time for the slower team is:
\[
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the difference in time between the two teams.**

The difference in time is:
\[
222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:

\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row:

\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, it is \(\boxed{25}\) percent more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits, and then use that information to find out how many pieces of straw were given to the rats.

1. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits is 20.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed among all the small rodents is 160.
   - Subtract the pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total:
     \[
     160 - 50 - 20 = 90
     \]
   - So, 90 pieces of straw were given to the rats.

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage. Then the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is:
     \[
     3r \times 6 = 18r
     \]
   - We know that the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 90, so:
     \[
     18r = 90
     \]
   - Solving for \( r \):
     \[
     r = \frac{90}{18} = 5
     \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the total amount including the monthly interest. The initial amount Mandy owes is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%.

First, let's calculate the amount after the first month:
\[ \text{Amount after 1 month} = 100 + 100 \times 0.02 = 100 \times 1.02 = 102 \]

Next, we calculate the amount after the second month:
\[ \text{Amount after 2 months} = 102 + 102 \times 0.02 = 102 \times 1.02 = 104.04 \]

Finally, we calculate the amount after the third month:
\[ \text{Amount after 3 months} = 104.04 + 104.04 \times 0.02 = 104.04 \times 1.02 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is:
\[ \boxed{106.12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

1. **Cost of buying the bags:**
   - The cost per bag is $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for \( x \) bags is \( 20x \).

2. **Cost of transporting the bags:**
   - The transportation cost per bag is $2.
   - Therefore, the total transportation cost for \( x \) bags is \( 2x \).

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost for buying and transporting the bags is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \).

4. **Revenue from selling the bags:**
   - The selling price per bag is $30.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is \( 30x \).

5. **Profit:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - The trader made a total profit of $400.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation for profit as:
     \[
     30x - 22x = 400
     \]

6. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   8x = 400
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{400}{8}
   \]
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

The trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"

"To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for the flock.
2. Convert the weekly amount into a daily amount.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for a flock of ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per week is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly amount by 7:
\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in the number of trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Number of trees after 30% die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, 70% of the trees survive. The number of trees that survive is:
   \[
   130 \times 0.70 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

So, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are:
     \[
     18 - 6 = 12
     \]
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out on the front yard.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is:
     \[
     12 + 18 = 30
     \]
   - The total number of white flamingos is still 6 (since the 6 pink ones were painted white).

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - The number of pink flamingos is 30.
   - The number of white flamingos is 6.
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is:
     \[
     30 - 6 = 24

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has in total.

1. **Initial Number of Cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards Collected in the First Month:**
   She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Cards Collected in the Second Month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

4. **Cards Collected in the Third Month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200

   Now, we sum up all the cards she has.
   \[
   20 \text{ (initial)} + 60 \text{ (first month)} + 40 \text{ (second month)} + 200 \text{ (third month)} = 320
   \]

So, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[
\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B}
\]

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:

\[
500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents}
\]

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A per sentence. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:

\[
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence}
\]

For 500 sentences, Publisher B pays:

\[
500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents}
\]

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the payments from both publishers:

\[
2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents}
\]

   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese used for sandwiches is:
     \[
     2 \text{ slices/sandwich} \times 7 \text{ sandwiches} = 14 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices per omelet.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese used for omelets is:
     \[
     3 \text{ slices/omelet} \times 3 \text{ omelets} = 9 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese is:
     \[
     8 \text{ slices}
     \]

4. **Total slices of cheese used:**
   - Adding up all the slices of cheese used:
     \[
     14 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 31 \text{ slices}
     \]

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue pens Janet bought. Since there are 6 blue pens in each of the 6 bags, the total number of blue pens is:
\[ 6 \text{ pens/bag} \times 6 \text{ bags} = 36 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of red pens Janet bought. Since there are 6 red pens in each of the 2 bags, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 6 \text{ pens/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, let's find the total number of pens Janet has by adding the green pens, yellow pens, blue pens, and red pens together. Janet originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, and she bought 36 blue pens and 12 red pens. So the total number of pens is:
\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 36 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} = 80 \text{ pens} \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Janet has now is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of tests and the desired average:**
   - Mr. Bert gives 6 tests each semester.
   - Brinley wants an average of 93.

2. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93:**
   \[
   \text{Total score needed} = 93 \times 6 = 558
   \]

3. **Sum the scores of the first five tests:**
   \[
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

4. **Determine the score needed on the sixth test:**
   - Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
   - The total score after including the sixth test will be \( 438 + x \).
   - Since Brinley can remove the lowest score from the first five tests, we need to consider the possible lowest scores and their impact on the average.

5. **Identify the lowest score among the first five tests:**
   - The lowest score is 71.

6. **Calculate the adjusted total score after removing the lowest score:**
   - If 71 is removed, the adjusted total score is \( 438 - 71 = 367 \).

7. **Set up the equation for the desired average:**
   \[
   \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
   \]

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   367 + x = 93 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   367 + x = 465
   \]
   \[
   x = 465 - 367
   \]
   \[
   x = 98
   \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score \(\boxed{98}\) on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93."
"To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

First, calculate the total kilometers for one week:
\[
5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 125 \text{ kilometers/week}
\]

Next, calculate the total kilometers for four weeks:
\[
125 \text{ kilometers/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ kilometers}
\]

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

First, calculate the total kilometers for one week:
\[
2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 120 \text{ kilometers/week}
\]

Next, calculate the total kilometers for three weeks:
\[
120 \text{ kilometers/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ kilometers}
\]

**Total Kilometers:**
Add the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks:
\[
500 \text{ kilometers} + 360 \text{ kilometers} = 860 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Thus, the total number of kilometers Micheal did is:
\[
\boxed{860}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, and each weighs 40g:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, and each weighs 20g:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g} \]

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:

\[ \boxed{2600} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12
   \]
3. On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday is:
   \[
   5 \times 12 = 60
   \]
4. To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes bought each day:
   \[
   4 + 12 + 60 = 76
   \]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates (which is 6 plates) will cost:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \text{ dollars} \]

Since twenty dozen cups is equal to \(24 \times 20 = 480\) cups, the cost of each cup is:
\[ \frac{34800}{480} = 72.5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ \boxed{72.5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and the shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn. She earns $4 each time, so she earns \(4x\) dollars from mowing the lawn.
- Sara already has $10 saved before she starts babysitting and mowing the lawn, so her total savings before earning any money from these activities is $10.

Now, we need to find out how much more money Sara needs to afford the items:
- The total amount of money Sara needs is $70.
- The total amount of money Sara will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn is \(10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x\).

We set up the equation to find \(x\):
\[30 + 4x = 70\]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[4x = 40\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[x = 10\]

So, Sara must mow the lawn \(\boxed{10}\) times before she can afford the jacket and shoes."
"Let's define the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day each, and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day each. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, the number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, so we can write the following equations:

\[ 5w + 3r = 42 \]
\[ w = r + 2 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \( w \):

\[ 5(r + 2) + 3r = 42 \]

Now, distribute and combine like terms:

\[ 5r + 10 + 3r = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Next, isolate \( r \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Then, solve for \( r \) by dividing both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has \( \boxed{4} \) red chickens."
"First, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \(d\) is 15 miles and the speed \(v\) is 3 miles per hour. Substituting these values into the formula gives:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers counted on the first day.
2. Calculate the number of customers counted on the second day.
3. Use the total number of customers over the three days to find the number of customers on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

Next, on the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Let the number of customers on the third day be \( x \). According to the problem, the total number of customers over the three days is 500. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 250 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago as \( B_0 \) and the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( S_0 \). According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write:

\[ B_0 = 2S_0 \]

Now, let's denote the amount of water in the big pool now as \( B \) and the amount of water in the small pool now as \( S \). Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water lost from each pool in the last 4 minutes is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons. Therefore, the current amount of water in the big pool is:

\[ B = B_0 - 16 \]

And the current amount of water in the small pool is:

\[ S = S_0 - 16 \]

According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can write:

\[ B = 4S \]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( B_0 \) and \( S_0 \), we get:

\[ B_0 - 16 = 4(S_0 - 16) \]

We already know from the first equation that \( B_0 = 2S_0 \). Substituting \( B_0 = 2S_0 \) into the equation above, we get:

\[ 2S_0 - 16 = 4(S_0 - 16) \]

Expanding and simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2S_0 - 16 = 4S_0 - 64 \]

Rearranging terms to isolate \( S_0 \), we get:

\[ 64 - 16 = 4S_0 - 2S_0 \]
\[ 48 = 2S_0 \]
\[ S_0 = 24 \]

Now that we have \( S_0 \), we can find \( S \):

\[ S = S_0 - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8 \]

So, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{44}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to determine the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of dahlias in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

\[ \text{Number of dahlias} = \text{Number of roses} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of flowers in the vase by adding the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15 \]

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information given.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

Next, we need to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years old}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years will be:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years old}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years will be:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years old}
  \]

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of the three in three years is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"To determine how many points Jojo scored, we need to first calculate the points scored by each of the other three students: Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna.

1. **Naomi's Points:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Points:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. First, we calculate half of Naomi's points:
   \[
   \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   Then, we add 10 to this value:
   \[
   34 + 10 = 44
   \]
   So, Yuri scored 44 points.

3. **Brianna's Points:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Therefore, we add 17 to Naomi's points:
   \[
   68 + 17 = 85
   \]
   So, Brianna scored 85 points.

4. **Total Points:**
   The total points scored by all four students is 251. We can verify this by summing the points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 = 197
   \]
   To find Jojo's points, we subtract the total points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total:
   \[
   251 - 197 = 54
   \]

Thus, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent solving puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on Sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one Sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 Sudoku puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on Sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is \(\boxed{70}\) minutes."
"1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank. Therefore, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater, which is twice the amount of water left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank, the total amount of water in the tank now is:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"First, let's determine the number of petunias Andy plants. According to the problem, Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. Since he plants 90 geraniums, the number of petunias is calculated as follows:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, Andy plants 50 petunias. Next, we need to find the total number of flowers he plants by adding the number of geraniums and petunias together:

\[ 90 + 50 = 140 \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is:

\[
\boxed{140}
\]"
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, it spends a third of $15000 on advertising, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{15000}{3} = 5000
\]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising for the second year. The total amount spent on advertising over the two years is:

\[
15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is \(\boxed{20000}\)."
"To determine the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.

\[
\text{Cost for Carlos} = 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.

\[
\text{Cost for Benji} = 18 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs for both Carlos and Benji:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for Carlos} + \text{Cost for Benji} = 90 \, \text{dollars} + 90 \, \text{dollars} = 180 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is:

\[
\boxed{180}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the number of days it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car. According to the problem, it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus. Since it takes 6 days to travel by bus, the travel time by car is:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total travel time for the round trip. Andrew will travel to Rochester by bus and return by car. Therefore, the total travel time is the sum of the travel time by bus and the travel time by car:

\[
6 \text{ days (by bus)} + 3 \text{ days (by car)} = 9 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of Pokemon card James has after the changes.

1. **Fire Type Cards:**
   - James originally has 30 fire type cards.
   - Number of fire type cards remains the same: \(30\).

2. **Grass Type Cards:**
   - James originally has 20 grass type cards.
   - He buys 14 more grass type cards.
   - New total of grass type cards: \(20 + 14 = 34\).

3. **Water Type Cards:**
   - James originally has 40 water type cards.
   - He loses 8 water type cards.
   - New total of water type cards: \(40 - 8 = 32\).

Next, we calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has after these changes:
\[
30 \text{ (fire type)} + 34 \text{ (grass type)} + 32 \text{ (water type)} = 96 \text{ (total cards)}
\]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type card. The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage:
\[
\left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[
\left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33
\]

Rounding to the nearest integer:
\[
33
\]

Thus, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is \(\boxed{33}\)."
"Let's break down the cost of Chad's burrito order step by step:

1. **Base burrito cost**: $6.50
2. **Extra meat**: $2.00
3. **Extra cheese**: $1.00
4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **2 sauces (each $0.25)**: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
6. **Upgrade for chips and a drink**: $3.00

First, we sum up the additional costs:
\[ 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 7.50 \]

Next, we add the base burrito cost to the total additional costs:
\[ 6.50 + 7.50 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, which he uses at checkout. Therefore, we subtract this amount from the total:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

So, the final amount Chad still owes is:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, their combined rate is \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[
\frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time it takes them to complete the puzzle is:

\[
\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

"To determine how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm.
2. Subtract the number of watermelons harvested the first time from the total to find the remaining watermelons.
3. Calculate how many of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later.
4. Subtract the number of watermelons harvested the second time from the remaining watermelons to find the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36
   \]
   So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest the first time.

2. Subtract the number of watermelons harvested the first time from the total to find the remaining watermelons:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
   So, 84 watermelons remained after the first harvest.

3. Calculate how many of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \text{ of } 84 = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63
   \]
   So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest the second time.

4. Subtract the number of watermelons harvested the second time from the remaining watermelons to find the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]
   So, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[
12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
\]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[
240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
\]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars.

\[
240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
\]

Then, we calculate the registration cost. Each car has a registration fee of $1000, and there are 12 cars.

\[
12 \times 1000 = 12,000
\]

Finally, we add the registration fees to the total cost including tax.

\[
264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
\]

Thus, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

\[
\boxed{276000}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. According to the problem, Robert collected 20 shells on Monday, and Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert. Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday is:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. The problem states that on Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. This means she collected 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday. Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is:

\[ 25 \times 2 = 50 \]

So, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Given that Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden, and there were 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = \(\frac{1}{2} \times\) Number of ants
Number of bugs = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25\)

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs together:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25 = 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"Initially, there are 36 penguins sunbathing. 

One-third of the penguins jump in and swim in the ocean:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins swim in the ocean.

Another one-third of the penguins go inside the cave to eat their dinner:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins go inside the cave.

To find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that have left from the initial number:
\[
36 - 12 - 12 = 12
\]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of tomatoes they both eat per day:

\[
6 + 3 = 9 \text{ tomatoes per day}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of tomatoes they eat per week is:

\[
9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week}
\]

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes by the number of tomatoes each vine produces:

\[
\frac{63}{3} = 21 \text{ vines}
\]

Thus, the number of vines Steve needs is:

\[
\boxed{21}
\]"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

First, we calculate the total number of slices needed. John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{80}{8} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order \(\boxed{10}\) pizzas."
"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we need to follow the process step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using the 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new pens.
3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 5 pens he made from the first cycle, giving him a total of 10 pens. From these 10 pens, he can make \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \) new pens.
4. **Third Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 2 new pens plus the 2 pens he made from the second cycle, giving him a total of 4 pens. From these 4 pens, he can make \( \frac{4}{5} = 0 \) new pens (since 4 is less than 5).

So, the total number of pens he can have is the sum of the pens he initially bought and the pens he made in each cycle:
\[ 25 + 5 + 2 = 32 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}

"To determine the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we start by identifying the age of each individual based on the given information.

1. Jessa's age is given as 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa. Therefore, Joan's age is:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan. Therefore, Mary's age is:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we sum the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:
\[
23 + 25 + 20 = 68

3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Determine the number of students who went out through exit C by subtracting the students who went out through exits A and B from the total number of students.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A:
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit A} = 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. Determine the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students:
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

4. Determine the number of students who went out through exit C by subtracting the students who went out through exits A and B from the total number of students:
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit C} = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike still has after he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals and he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he now has:

\[5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals}\]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is:

\[3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages}\]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages in a week. The time it takes for Mike to write one page is 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing in a week is:

\[30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 180 \text{ minutes}\]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours}\]

So, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[\boxed{3}\]"
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes spent on these calls is:

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes to find out how many minutes are left:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries Griffin had at each stage and how many fries Ginger gave him.

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:**
   \[
   24 \text{ fries}
   \]

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   \[
   5 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After Kyle took 5 fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19 \text{ fries}
   \]

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After Billy took 10 fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin. After receiving \( x \) fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   9 + x \text{ fries}
   \]

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is:
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x \text{ fries}
   \]

6. **Final number of fries Griffin had:**
   According to the problem, Griffin ended up with 27 fries:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20

Thus, Ginger gave Griffin \(\boxed{20}\) fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

To find \( f \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works per week:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours for the entire 5 weeks:

\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

The makeup artist gives a 10% discount for the total amount of work done. First, we calculate 10% of the total cost:

\[ 10\% \times 30000 \text{ dollars} = 0.10 \times 30000 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Jean pays:

\[ 30000 \text{ dollars} - 3000 \text{ dollars} = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount Jean pays is:

\[ \boxed{27000} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how many cookies Sue ate on each day.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, Sue ate:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, Sue ate:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

The total number of cookies Sue ate is:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

The total number of cookies her sister ate is:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister. Since each cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by Sue is:
\[ 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

The total calories consumed by her sister is:
\[ 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is:
\[ 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

So, the final answer is:

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, so we calculate 30% of 30:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

This means Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. Therefore, the number of times Anne went down the slide is:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times, we calculate:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide \(\boxed{84}\) times."
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. Therefore, the total number of cows is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, the number of new cows in each stall is:
\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \]

Adding these new cows to the original 20 cows in each stall, the total number of cows in each stall now is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

We need to find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls. Therefore, the total number of cows in 8 stalls is:

1. **Pennies**: 
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Total value of pennies = \( 100 \times 0.01 = 1.00 \) dollars.

2. **Nickels**: 
   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Total value of nickels = \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2.00 \) dollars.

3. **Dimes**: 
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Total value of dimes = \( 20 \times 0.10 = 2.00 \) dollars.

4. **Dollar bills**: 
   - Brady has 40 dollar bills.
   - Each dollar bill is worth $1.00.
   - Total value of dollar bills = \( 40 \times 1.00 = 40.00 \) dollars.

Now, we add up the total value of all the coins and bills:

\[
1.00 \text{ (pennies)} + 2.00 \text{ (nickels)} + 2.00 \text{ (dimes)} + 40.00 \text{ (dollar bills)} = 45.00 \text{ dollars}

"First, we need to determine the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood tree. We do this by dividing the total height of the tree by the length of each section:

\[
\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section:

\[
20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood. To find out how much weight was eaten, we calculate 30% of the total weight:

\[
0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the remaining weight of the redwood, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the original total weight:

\[
8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten 30% of it is:

\[
\boxed{5600}

Additionally, there is a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that is over a week overdue. Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:

\[ \$4.00 + \$2.00 = \$6.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{6.00}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

Given that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can write:
\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
Since \( A_a = 52 \), we substitute to find:
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
Solving for \( J_a \):
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]

We also know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
Substituting \( J_a = 44 \):
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Now, substituting \( J_b = 48 \) into the equation for Andrea's bananas:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Now, we can find the total number of fruits. Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, and Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas. The total number of fruits is:
\[ A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days and then find out how much flour is required for that total number of cookies.

1. Calculate the total number of cookies:
   \[
   36 \text{ cookies today} + 30 \text{ cookies tomorrow} = 66 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. Determine how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can set up the following proportion:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
   \]
   Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups}
   \]

Therefore, Carla will need \(\boxed{11}\) cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"First, we need to determine how many pennies are in two-thirds of the cup. The cup contains 9,300 pennies. To find two-thirds of 9,300, we perform the following calculation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in two-thirds of the cup. Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can find the total dollar amount by multiplying the number of pennies by $0.01:

\[
6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup is \(\boxed{62}\)."
"First, we calculate the total number of marbles Maddison has from the 5 boxes. Each box contains 50 marbles, so we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles per box:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 50 \text{ marbles/box} = 250 \text{ marbles} \]

Next, we add the 20 marbles she gets from her friend to the 250 marbles she already has:

\[ 250 \text{ marbles} + 20 \text{ marbles} = 270 \text{ marbles} \]

So, the final number of marbles Maddison has is:

\[ \boxed{270} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand. We subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[
\text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8
\]

Thus, the number of trees in Harry's yard that are more than in Ferdinand's yard is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has.

1. Carmen has $100.
2. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
   \[
   \text{Samantha's money} = 100 + 25 = 125
   \]
3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
   \[
   \text{Daisy's money} = 125 + 50 = 175
   \]

Next, we add the amounts of money each girl has to find the total:
\[
\text{Total money} = \text{Carmen's money} + \text{Samantha's money} + \text{Daisy's money}
\]
\[
\text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175
\]

Now, we perform the addition:
\[
100 + 125 = 225
\]
\[
225 + 175 = 400
\]

Thus, the total amount of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined is:
\[
\boxed{400}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500
   \]

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total price of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = \$409,500
   \]

4. **Determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} = 409,500 - 400,000 = \$9,500
   \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the selling price, the transfer fees, the brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 3\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = \$12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = \$20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total fees:**
   \[
   \text{Total fees} = \text{Transfer fees} + \text{Brokerage fee} = \$12,000 + \$20,000 = \$32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Total fees} - \text{Remaining loan amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = \$400,000 - \$32,000 - \$250,000 = \$118,000
   \]

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:
\[
\boxed{118000}

"To determine the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate the time for each step.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees.
   - First, calculate 40% of 20 minutes:
     \[
     0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Add this to the initial 20 minutes:
     \[
     20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Therefore, it takes 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to warm the oil.
   - The total time to warm the oil is 28 minutes.
   - Subtract 5 minutes from 28 minutes:
     \[
     28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total time:**
   - Add the time to heat the oil to 300 degrees, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees, and the time to cook the chicken:
     \[
     20 + 28 + 23 = 71 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is \(\boxed{71}\) minutes."
"To determine the total amount spent by the real estate agent on the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- The agent bought 50 newspaper ads.

\[
\text{Cost of newspaper ads} = 50 \text{ ads} \times 5 \text{ dollars/ad} = 250 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- The agent bought 15 television ads.

\[
\text{Cost of television ads} = 15 \text{ ads} \times 75 \text{ dollars/ad} = 1125 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 250 \text{ dollars} + 1125 \text{ dollars} = 1375 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the real estate agent spent a total of \(\boxed{1375}\) dollars on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so the number of golf balls is:

\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

Half of these golf balls are blue, so the number of blue golf balls is:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(\frac{300}{2} = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms from all three bags to find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is \(\boxed{762}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:

\[ 3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house} \]

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:

\[ 6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows} \]

Next, we need to account for the additional windows in each house. There are 4 additional windows in each house, and since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:

\[ 4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows} \]

To find the total number of windows in both houses, we add the number of windows in the bedrooms to the number of additional windows:

\[ 12 \text{ windows} + 8 \text{ windows} = 20 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine the change the mother receives, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought. The items and their respective costs are:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

We add these amounts together to find the total cost:

\[
4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35
\]

First, add the cost of the cocoa and the laundry:

\[
4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65
\]

Next, add the cost of the pasta to the result:

\[
13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00
\]

The total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[
20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00
\]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is:

\[
\boxed{5.00}
\]"
"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we need to break down the total number of stitches and allocate them according to the given information.

1. **Total number of stitches for the sweater:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches} = 1800
   \]

2. **Stitches for the body of the sweater:**
   \[
   \text{Body stitches} = 900
   \]

3. **Stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body.
   \[
   \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

4. **Stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

5. **Stitches for the sleeves:**
   The total number of stitches for the sleeves can be found by subtracting the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches.
   \[
   \text{Sleeves stitches} = 1800 - (900 + 90 + 180)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sleeves stitches} = 1800 - 1170 = 630
   \]

6. **Stitches per sleeve:**
   Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of sleeve stitches by 2.
   \[
   \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

Thus, each sleeve takes \(\boxed{315}\) stitches."
"To determine how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds:
- Number of tomato seed packets: 20
- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40

\[
\text{Total cost for tomato seeds} = 20 \times 40 = 800
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the celery seeds:
- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30

\[
\text{Total cost for celery seeds} = 80 \times 30 = 2400
\]

Now, we add the two amounts to find the total cost for all the seeds:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 800 + 2400 = 3200
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is \(\boxed{3200}\)."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part of his performance and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
     \[
     2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
     \[
     \frac{108}{3} = 36 \text{ lines}
     \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
     \[
     54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
     \]

4. **Total Lines:**
   - Sum the lines from the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene.

"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32
\]

So, 32 cards had the letter A. This means the remaining number of cards is:

\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter B. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

So, 24 cards had the letter B. This means the remaining number of cards is:

\[
48 - 24 = 24
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter C. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15
\]

So, 15 cards had the letter C. This means the remaining number of cards is:

\[
24 - 15 = 9
\]

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"First, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the small holes. Since it takes him 3 minutes to dig one small hole, for 30 small holes, the time spent is:
\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the large holes. Since it takes him 10 minutes to dig one large hole, for 15 large holes, the time spent is:
\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both small and large holes to get the total time in minutes:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be their current sum of ages plus 10 years each. Since their current sum of ages is 20, in 10 years, the sum will be:

\[ 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 \]

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( S \):
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides to solve for \( 3S \):
\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3 to find \( S \):
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently \(\boxed{6}\) years old."
"To determine the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the popsicles:
\[
\text{Number of popsicles} = 20
\]
\[
\text{Cost per popsicle} = \$0.25
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of popsicles} = 20 \times 0.25 = \$5.00
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
\[
\text{Number of ice cream bars} = 4
\]
\[
\text{Cost per ice cream bar} = \$0.50
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream bars} = 4 \times 0.50 = \$2.00

"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can set up the following equation for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. Since there are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. Since there are 60 mambas and each mamba has 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so initially, there are:

\[ 12 + 3 = 15 \text{ people} \]

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the number of guests is:

\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ guests} \]

Adding the guests to the initial count of people gives:

\[ 15 + 24 = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, the number of pizzas needed is:

\[ \frac{39}{3} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Therefore, the total amount Maddy will spend is:

\[
\boxed{195}

"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   \[
   \text{Total length of topaz gemstones} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of each necklace is 25 inches.
   - Subtract the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length.
   \[
   \text{Remaining length for sterling silver beads} = 25 - 8 = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads needed:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is \(\frac{1}{4}\) inch long.
   - Divide the remaining length by the length of one sterling silver bead.
   \[
   \text{Number of sterling silver beads} = \frac{17}{\frac{1}{4}} = 17 \times 4 = 68
   \]

Thus, Katerina uses \(\boxed{68}\) sterling silver beads per necklace."
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these totals together:

"To determine the number of 5-star rows on the flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars in the known rows.

First, we calculate the number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate the number of stars in the two rows of 6 stars:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the known rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \]

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. Therefore, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \]

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Thus, the number of 5-star rows is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the weight capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the result is a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, the number of trucks needed is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate the number of medals Izzy has as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals of Ali and Izzy} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Let's denote the total number of medals given out for counting as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x = 10 \times 39 \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[ x = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since there are 8 packets and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get. With 4 adults each getting 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. Therefore, each child will get:
\[ \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]

So, each child will get \(\boxed{2}\) chocolate bars."
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. To find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we first determine how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

1. **Mike's points:**
   - Mike has 21 points.

2. **Jim's points:**
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike.
   - \( 21 - 3 = 18 \) points.

3. **Tony's points:**
   - Tony has 2 times more than Mike.
   - \( 2 \times 21 = 42 \) points.

Next, we need to add the extra points for the fourth round. The extra point is given to each player if they have over 20 points.

4. **Mike's total points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike has 21 points, which is over 20.
   - \( 21 + 1 = 22 \) points.

5. **Jim's total points after the fourth round:**
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20.
   - \( 18 + 0 = 18 \) points.

6. **Tony's total points after the fourth round:**
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20.
   - \( 42 + 1 = 43 \) points.

Finally, we sum up the total points of all three players:

\[
22 + 18 + 43 = 83
\]

Thus, the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{83}\)."
"First, let's determine the ages of the sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges.

Now, we find the total number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will originally bought 15 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Thus, the number of oranges left unwashed is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of each activity Darren does on the second day.

- **Pushups on the second day**: 
  \[
  100 + 20 = 120
  \]

- **Squats on the second day**: 
  \[
  50 - 10 = 40
  \]

- **Dumbbell presses on the second day**: 
  \[
  20 \times 2 = 40
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of each activity done over the two days.

- **Total pushups**:
  \[
  100 \text{ (first day)} + 120 \text{ (second day)} = 220
  \]

- **Total squats**:
  \[
  50 \text{ (first day)} + 40 \text{ (second day)} = 90
  \]

- **Total dumbbell presses**:
  \[
  20 \text{ (first day)} + 40 \text{ (second day)} = 60
  \]

Finally, we sum up all the activities done over the two days:
\[
220 \text{ (pushups)} + 90 \text{ (squats)} + 60 \text{ (dumbbell presses)} = 370
\]

Thus, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{370}
\]"
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily rice consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner).
   - Therefore, each person consumes \(0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day}\).
   - For 5 people, the total daily consumption is \(0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 2 \, \text{kg/day}\).

2. **Calculate the total weekly rice consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly consumption is \(2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week}\).

3. **Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - The total amount of rice is 42 kg.
   - The weekly consumption is 14 kg.
   - Therefore, the number of weeks the rice will last is \(\frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate the total number of crates Sam sold from Tuesday to Sunday.

- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.

Adding these together:

\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

So, Sam sold a total of 65 crates from Tuesday to Sunday.

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates in a week. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. The bids increase by $50 each time, and she bids after each of the 3 other people, making a total of 4 bids.

1. The first bid (opening bid) is $200.
2. The second bid is $200 + $50 = $250.
3. The third bid is $250 + $50 = $300.
4. The fourth bid is $300 + $50 = $350.

Now, we sum up all the bids:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 \]

We can add these step by step:
\[ 200 + 250 = 450 \]
\[ 450 + 300 = 750 \]
\[ 750 + 350 = 1100 \]

So, the total amount Carmen spends on the desk is \(\boxed{1100}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total distance John travels in a day. Since his work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back, he travels:

\[ 30 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 60 \text{ miles per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance he travels in a week. Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total distance per week is:

\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ miles/week} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance he travels in a year. Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total distance per year is:

\[ 300 \text{ miles/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year} \]

John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the cost for the miles driven in a year is:

\[ 15000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total annual bonus is:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Adding the cost of the miles driven and the annual bonus gives the total annual cost:

\[ 30000 \text{ dollars/year} + 1800 \text{ dollars/year} = 31800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is:

\[ \boxed{31800} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total amount of time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. According to the problem, on Monday he exercised for 16 minutes and on Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes. Therefore, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday is:

\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. So, we need to calculate twice the 39 minutes:

\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the folding process. Each piece of paper is folded in half, creating two pages on the front and two pages on the back. Therefore, each piece of paper contributes 4 pages to the tabloid.

Given that the tabloid has 32 pages, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper used by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper contributes:

\[
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
\]

Thus, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the amount left after the rides is:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annika has left is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many books Elise sold in the second year and then calculate the total amount of money she earned from those sales.

1. **Total number of books initially**: 250
2. **Number of unsold books currently**: 50
3. **Number of books sold so far**: \(250 - 50 = 200\)
4. **Books sold this year**: 45
5. **Books sold in the first year**: Let's denote this as \(x\).
6. **Books sold in the second year**: Let's denote this as \(y\).

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of books sold so far is 200.
- The number of books sold in the first year is twice the number of books sold this year.

So, we can write the following equations:
\[ x + y + 45 = 200 \]
\[ x = 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Now substitute \(x = 90\) into the first equation:
\[ 90 + y + 45 = 200 \]
\[ 135 + y = 200 \]
\[ y = 200 - 135 \]
\[ y = 65 \]

So, Elise sold 65 books in the second year. Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[ 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is \(\boxed{1300}\)."
"First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage. Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of:

\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ hours/week} \]

At a rate of $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

\[ 50 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of weeks in April. April typically has 4 weeks. Therefore, Watson's total earnings for April are:

\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$3200 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3200} \]"
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

First, calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16 of them, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40
\]

Next, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales.

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning sales} = 60 - 40 = 20
\]

Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of the remaining 20 loaves.

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Therefore, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, which is the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks.

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, and Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds (the same as Joey in one week), we can calculate the total weeks Sandy needs to lose 8 pounds as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

So, it will take Sandy 8 weeks to lose 8 pounds. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:

- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Now, let's calculate the savings on the milk:

- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5

Next, we calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:

- Total savings on ice cream: 2 tubs * $2/tub = $4
- Total savings on milk: 4 packets * $0.5/packet = $2

Finally, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to get the total savings:

- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

So, the total amount saved is $6."
"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Calculate the number of extra arms:**
   - Extra arms grow every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms is given by:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Calculate the number of extra legs:**
   - Extra legs grow every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs is given by:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Calculate the total number of new limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 + 3 = 8
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, the serum will cause the person to grow a total of \(\boxed{8}\) new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each:
\[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the suitcases. Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each:
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times the cost of a business suit is:
\[ 5 \times 100 = 500 \]
Adding $700 to this amount gives the cost of the flight ticket:
\[ 500 + 700 = 1200 \]

The total amount Theo has initially is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he can spend on the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket is:
\[ 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \]

Now, we calculate the total amount spent on the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ 600 + 150 + 1200 = 2000 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ 4000 - 2000 = 2000 \]

So, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"First, let's determine the daily egg consumption for the family.

- Three people eat 3 eggs each per day, so the total for these three people is:
  \[
  3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}
  \]

- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each per day, so the total for these two people is:
  \[
  2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}
  \]

- Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed by the family each day is:
  \[
  9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}
  \]

Next, we calculate the weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[
13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week}
\]

So, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"To determine Trent's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Therefore, we can calculate Trent's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Thus, Trent is \(\boxed{32}\) years old."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile. Let's break down the information given and solve it step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago, so his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20, so the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot 3D + 2 \cdot \frac{D}{2} = 2 \cdot 105 \]
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \), we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited to her party. She invited 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people.

The total number of people invited is:
\[ 2 \times 6 + 3 \times 4 = 12 + 12 = 24 \]

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. According to the problem, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of those 8 people had previous commitments. So, we calculate 1/4 of 8:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \]

This means that 2 people couldn't come because they had previous commitments, and 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \]

To find out how many people actually showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:
\[ 24 - 10 = 14 \]

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after buying from Johanna and receiving from his father:**
   - Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
   - The store initially had 50 marbles.
   - His father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.

   Therefore, the total number of marbles Solomon has is:
   \[
   20 \text{ (bought from Johanna)} + 50 \text{ (initially in the store)} + 8 \text{ (from his father)} = 78 \text{ marbles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the marbles:**
   - Each marble weighs 2 kg.
   - Therefore, the total weight of 78 marbles is:
   \[
   78 \text{ marbles} \times 2 \text{ kg/marble} = 156 \text{ kg}
   \]

The total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is \(\boxed{156}\) kg."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. **Number of Girls:**
   - The classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys.
   - Number of girls = \(3 \times 30 = 90\).

2. **Number of Nongendered Children:**
   - The classroom has \(\frac{1}{10}\) as many nongendered children as boys.
   - Number of nongendered children = \(\frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3\).

3. **Total Number of Children:**
   - Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children.
   - Total number of children = \(30 + 90 + 3 = 123\).

The total number of children in the classroom is \(\boxed{123}\)."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion:
   \[
   \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion:
   \[
   \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
6. Solving for \( P \):
   \[
   P = \frac{45}{3} = 15
   \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \)."
"To determine how many women are left at the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of people at the beginning of the party.
2. Determine how many people left after an hour.
3. Find out how many people stayed at the party.
4. Use the information about the number of men who stayed to find out how many women stayed.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people at the beginning of the party.**
The total number of people is the sum of the number of men and women:
\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

**Step 2: Determine how many people left after an hour.**
Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]
So, 10 people left the party.

**Step 3: Find out how many people stayed at the party.**
The number of people who stayed is the total number of people minus the number of people who left:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

**Step 4: Use the information about the number of men who stayed to find out how many women stayed.**
We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Let \( w \) be the number of women who stayed. The total number of people who stayed is the sum of the number of men and women who stayed:
\[ 22 + w = 30 \]
Solving for \( w \):
\[ w = 30 - 22 = 8 \]

So, the number of women who are left at the party is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[
\frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs:

\[
2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = 26 \]

Since the number of loose pencils is 2, we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 24 \]

Since Jam has three boxes and the total number of pencils in these boxes is 24, each box must contain:

\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ pencils per box} \]

Now, let's determine the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils, so the total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need \(\boxed{9}\) boxes to store all their pencils."
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes added:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   \[
   \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weakening from the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   \[
   \text{Total weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weakening from the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.
   \[
   \text{Total weakening from cream} = 15 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weakening:**
   Add the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream.
   \[
   \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the trade ratio and the total number of new records they received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are traded.

If the 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records traded as follows:

\[ \text{Number of old records} = 2 \times \text{Number of new records} \]
\[ \text{Number of old records} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Next, we need to find the number of senior programmers. Since the total number of employees is 100 and there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

We know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. Therefore, the monthly payment to each senior programmer is:

\[
2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

The total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[
\boxed{224000}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many lollipops Oscar has at the end.

1. **Initial number of lollipops:**
   Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

2. **Lollipops eaten on the way to school:**
   Oscar eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]
   So, he has 22 lollipops left.

3. **Lollipops given to friends:**
   Oscar gives 14 lollipops to his friends.
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
   So, he has 8 lollipops left.

4. **Lollipops bought on the way home:**
   Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. He gave 14 lollipops to his friends, so he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
   Adding these to the lollipops he has left:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
   So, he has 36 lollipops now.

5. **Lollipops eaten later:**
   Oscar eats 3 more lollipops that night.
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]
   So, he has 33 lollipops left.

6. **Lollipops eaten in the morning:**
   Oscar eats 2 more lollipops in the morning.
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31
   \]
   So, he has 31 lollipops left.

The final number of lollipops Oscar has is:

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the percentage of charge needed to fully charge the phone.
2. Determine the time required to charge that percentage of the battery.

First, the phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which is a difference of:
\[ 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

Next, we know the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to find out how many 3-minute intervals are needed to charge 40 percentage points, we multiply:
\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time required to fully charge the phone is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

Therefore, the final number of lollipops Erin has left is:
\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's determine the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[
\text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we apply these rewards to the current shopping trip. The customer spent $43 and used their $4 off coupon. However, the coupon takes twice the amount of the rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon takes:

\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we subtract the coupon amount from the current purchase amount:

\[
43 - 8 = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the customer paid:

\[
\boxed{35}

"First, let's calculate the value of Maria's shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each.

\[ \text{Initial value} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. Therefore, the new price per share is:

\[ \text{New price per share} = \$8 + (0.50 \times \$8) = \$8 + \$4 = \$12 \]

The value of all 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ \text{Value after first year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share is:

\[ \text{New price per share} = \$12 - (0.25 \times \$12) = \$12 - \$3 = \$9 \]

The value of all 8 shares after the second year is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students. The total number of students in the class is 200, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To determine the total number of legs of the animals on Farmer Brown's farm, we need to follow these steps:

   Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
   Let \( H \) represent the number of chickens.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   H = 2C
   \]
   Additionally, the total number of animals is 60. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   C + H = 60
   \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   Substitute \( H = 2C \) into the second equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
   Solve for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 20
   \]
   Now, substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equation \( H = 2C \):
   \[
   H = 2 \times 20 = 40

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to find the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself. The weights of the animals are:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out the discount amount. The discount is 40%, so we calculate 40% of $60:
\[ 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the original total cost to find out how much Davos paid:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from selling tractors:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \, \text{tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from selling silos:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \, \text{silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in daily revenue between selling silos and tractors:

\[ \text{Difference in revenue} = \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

To find the percentage increase in revenue, we use the formula for percentage increase:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference in revenue}}{\text{Original revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now. 

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To determine how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

1. **Calculate the monthly cost of food:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Monthly cost of food = \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) dollars.

2. **Treats cost $20 per month.**

3. **Medicine costs $100 per month.**

4. **Calculate the total monthly cost:**
   - Total monthly cost = Cost of food + Cost of treats + Cost of medicine
   - Total monthly cost = \( 100 + 20 + 100 = 220 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total yearly cost:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Total yearly cost = Total monthly cost \(\times\) 12
   - Total yearly cost = \( 220 \times 12 = 2640 \) dollars.

Therefore, Madeline spends \(\boxed{2640}\) dollars on her dog per year."
"To determine the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Yoga class on Monday:**
   - Duration: 1 hour

2. **Cooking class on Tuesday:**
   - Duration: 3 times the yoga class
   - Calculation: \( 3 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \)

3. **Cheese-tasting event on Wednesday:**
   - Duration: 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes)

   - Calculation: \( \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \)

5. **Errands on Friday:**
   - Duration: 2 hours

Now, we sum up all the durations:

\[
1 \text{ hour} + 3 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours}
\]

\[
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Peyton’s after-work activities will take is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the school asked for twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies, and they asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies, the number of plant pots needed for the roses is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots required:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. John spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time John spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. Then:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]
Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The final answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add her initial savings to the earnings from both jobs to find out how much money she has in total:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the phone is $400. To find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount of money she has from the cost of the phone:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of each tree step by step.

1. The height of the shortest tree is given as 6 feet.
2. The height of the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree. Therefore, the height of the second tree is:
   \[
   6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees. First, we find the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
   \[
   6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. The height of the tallest tree is twice this combined height:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the height of the tallest tree is \(\boxed{34}\) feet."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean started with $28. After buying the toys, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities and then see how much money is left for the friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf:**
   - Morgan and her friends will play one round of mini-golf each.
   - The cost of one round of mini-golf is $5.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of friends Morgan can invite. Including Morgan, the total number of people is \( n + 1 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for mini-golf is \( 5 \times (n + 1) \).

2. **Cost of arcade tokens:**
   - Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens.
   - This cost is fixed at $5.

3. **Cost of go-karts:**
   - The cost of one go-kart ride is $10.
   - Morgan and her friends will ride the go-karts twice each.
   - Therefore, the total cost for go-karts is \( 10 \times 2 \times (n + 1) = 20 \times (n + 1) \).

4. **Total budget:**
   - Morgan's dad has budgeted $90 for the party.

Now, we set up the equation for the total cost and solve for \( n \):

\[
5 \times (n + 1) + 5 + 20 \times (n + 1) = 90
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5(n + 1) + 20(n + 1) + 5 = 90
\]

\[
25(n + 1) + 5 = 90
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
25(n + 1) = 85
\]

Divide both sides by 25:

\[
n + 1 = \frac{85}{25}
\]

\[
n + 1 = 3.4
\]

Subtract 1 from both sides:

\[
n = 2.4
\]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number (you can't invite a fraction of a friend), we round down to the nearest whole number:

\[
n = 2
\]

Therefore, Morgan can invite \(\boxed{2}\) friends."
"First, let's determine how much money Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. Therefore, the total cost of the lollipops each day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops} \times 25 \text{ cents per lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Marisa has left after buying the lollipops each day. Since she gets $5 as pocket money every day, the amount she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she will save:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after 5 days is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total cost of the gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Total cost of gumballs = \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the change Billy had after buying the gumballs:**
   - Billy initially had $10.
   - He spent $2 on gumballs.
   - Change after buying gumballs = \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) dollars.

3. **Determine how much money Billy spent on candy:**
   - Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs.
   - Half of his change = \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the amount spent on candy = \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   - The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound.
   - Number of pounds of candy = \( \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \) pounds.

Thus, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver just turned 45 years old, and this age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[
45 = 2x - 5
\]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[
45 + 5 = 2x
\]
\[
50 = 2x
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[
x = \frac{50}{2}
\]
\[
x = 25

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
2. The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
3. The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs. The combined distance of the first two legs is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days the train goes between services, we divide 18,000 miles by the daily travel distance of 900 miles:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

Therefore, the train needs service every 20 days. The final answer is:
\[\boxed{20}\]"
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. According to the problem, a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:
\[
3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing required:
\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the current points of Sara and Erin.
2. Determine Erin's points before the recent score.

First, we know that Sara currently has 8 points. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Erin's current points:

\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

This means that after scoring 14 points, Erin has 24 points. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring these 14 points, we subtract 14 from her current points:

\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pairs of tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale.

1. **Friday Sales:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes on Friday.

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   - On Saturday, the store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   - Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Saturday is:
     \[
     2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}
     \]

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   - On the last day of the sale, the store sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Sunday before returns is:
     \[
     \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs}
     \]
   - However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit.
   - Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Sunday after returns is:

   - Apples picked on Wednesday: 24
   - Total number of apples picked:
     \[
     14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \text{ apples}
     \]

Thus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of socks Lindsay has washed. Since 1 pair of socks consists of 2 socks, washing 10 pairs means she has washed \(10 \times 2 = 20\) socks from pairs. Additionally, she has washed 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is \(20 + 15 = 35\).

Lindsay started with 50 socks. If she has washed 35 socks, the number of socks she has missed is \(50 - 35 = 15\).

Thus, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rachel initially bought 23 cookies.
2. Janet gave her 42 more cookies. So, the total number of cookies Rachel had after Janet gave her the cookies is:

   \]
3. Rachel's brother then ate 44 cookies. So, the number of cookies left after her brother ate some is:
   \[
   65 - 44 = 21
   \]

Therefore, the number of cookies left for Rachel is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, we calculate the total interest on the loan. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

The principal is $3,650, the rate is 10% per year, and the time is 5/12 of a year (since five months is 5/12 of a year).

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 = 3650 \times 0.04167 = 152.0833 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 152.0833 = 3802.0833 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.0833}{5} = 760.41666 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"
"First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked. Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. The distance \(D\) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \]

For Cho:

\[ D_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked. Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. Using the same formula:

\[ D_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = D_{\text{Cho}} - D_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked \(\boxed{67}\) kilometers farther."
"First, let's determine how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. According to the problem, Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel and 40 more gold pesos than Axel.

So, Anna has:
- \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos
- \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is:
\[50 + 100 = 150\]

The total number of gold pesos they have together is:
\[80 + 120 = 200\]

Adding these together gives the total number of pesos they have:
\[150 + 200 = 350\]

So, the total number of pesos they have together is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling 36 cups is:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the total cost of the supplies. The cost of the supplies is given as $18. Therefore, the profit from selling all the lemonade is:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how many hours it takes her to sell all 36 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:
\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

To make the multiplication easier, we can break it down:

\[
12.8 \times 2.5 = 12.8 \times \left(2 + 0.5\right) = 12.8 \times 2 + 12.8 \times 0.5
\]

Calculating each term separately:

\[
12.8 \times 2 = 25.6
\]
\[
12.8 \times 0.5 = 6.4
\]

Adding these results together:

\[
25.6 + 6.4 = 32
\]

Thus, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had is:

\[
x = 32
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26
\]

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, on the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who can't make it} = 26 \times 0.5 = 13
\]

So, the number of girls who can perform is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who can perform} = 26 - 13 = 13
\]

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his five test scores. The test scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, we sum the test scores:
\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Adding these together step-by-step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the test scores is 400. Next, we divide this sum by the number of tests, which is 5, to find the average:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is:

"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the pencils separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost of 6 erasers is \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- Therefore, the cost of 8 pencils is \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together:
- The total cost is \( 12 + 24 = 36 \) dollars.

So, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. According to the problem, he delivers \( \frac{1}{3} \) as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. Since he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson, we calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu as follows:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

Thus, the total number of messages James delivers is:

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet.

The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives him 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride.

Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is:
\[ 2 \text{ tickets/ride} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4 \text{ per ride} \]

Since Dasha needs to ride 9 rides, the total cost for her is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36 \]

Now, let's compare the total costs for both David and Dasha.

David's total cost with the ride bracelet:
\[ \$30 \]

Dasha's total cost with individual tickets:
\[ \$36 \]

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's total cost from Dasha's total cost:
\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

Therefore, David saves:

"First, we need to determine the total number of gifts Monica is wrapping. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. Adding these together gives:

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

So, Monica is wrapping a total of 12 gifts. She has 144 inches of ribbon to use for the bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \]

Therefore, Monica can use \(\boxed{12}\) inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To determine how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles they have together is given as 165. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[11x = 165\]
To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has. Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles, and Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Thus, Sam has \(\boxed{15}\) more popsicles than Betty."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount.

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling these services. The discount amount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. The amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package and subscribing to the streaming services is:

"First, let's break down the time Carol spends on each activity:

1. **Writing the song**: 4 hours
2. **Recording the song**: Half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. **Editing**: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

Next, we calculate the total work time by summing up the time spent on each activity:
\[
4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total work time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[
\left( \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100\% = 0.2 \times 100\% = 20\%

Next, let's account for the cards she passed out and received:

1. Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
2. She passed out 5 cards to her family.
3. She received 17 cards from family and friends.

The total number of cards Erica passed out is:
\[24 + 5 = 29\]

The net change in the number of cards Erica has is the number of cards she received minus the number of cards she passed out:
\[17 - 29 = -12\]

So, the total number of cards Erica now has is:
\[50 - 29 - 12 = 9\]

Therefore, the final number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has is:

"First, let's determine the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours a day, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is the difference between the original and reduced usage:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy saved in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of stripes on each zebra:

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each. Therefore, the total number of stripes for these two zebras is:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34
   \]

2. The next zebra has 36 stripes.

3. The last zebra has half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes. Therefore, the number of stripes on this zebra is:
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18
   \]

Next, we sum the total number of stripes on all the zebras:
\[
34 + 36 + 18 = 88
\]

Now, we need to find the average number of stripes. There are 4 zebras in total. The average number of stripes is calculated by dividing the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:

"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese to make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, the number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people is:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat and cheese needed is:
   \[
   5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
   \]
   \[
   5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for 5 pounds of meat is:
   \[
   5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns in Allan's house. According to the problem, there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis initially.

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. Therefore, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Adding these 20 corns to the initial 80 corns, the new number of corns is:

\[ \text{New number of corns} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

\[ \text{Combined total} = 100 + 100 = 200 \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total steps Elliott needs to take in a day:**
   \[
   10,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

2. **Determine the steps Elliott has already taken:**
   - He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school.
     \[
     \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
     \]
   - He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
     \[
     5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
     \]

3. **Determine the steps remaining after his jog:**
   - After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.
     \[
     10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
     \]

4. **Calculate the steps taken during the jog:**
   - The steps taken during the jog can be found by subtracting the steps he had already taken from the total steps he had before his jog.
     \[
     8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
     \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[
\boxed{2000}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long, and it averages 200 words per page. Therefore, the total number of words is:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. So, the time it takes to read 9000 words is:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to leave 10 minutes before the 60-minute mark, which means he needs to leave by:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will be:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]
early.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment per employee in May: \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars
   - Total payment for all employees in May: \( 600 \times 40 = 24000 \) dollars

2. **Calculate the number of employees remaining after June:**
   - Number of employees who left in June: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Number of employees in June: 30
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment per employee in June: \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars
   - Total payment for all employees in June: \( 600 \times 30 = 18000 \) dollars

4. **Calculate the total payment for both months:**
   - Total payment for May: 24000 dollars
   - Total payment for June: 18000 dollars
   - Total payment for both months: \( 24000 + 18000 = 42000 \) dollars

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \(\boxed{42000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means that for every 1.5 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (which is half off $3).

Since Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy, we can break it down as follows:
- The first pound costs $3.
- The second pound costs $1.50 (which is half of $3).

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, each costing $0.25:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, we add up all the expenses:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the final amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the second pack of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice that amount:
\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the two packs of fireworks before the discount:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on the total cost of the two packs. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:
\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the two packs to find the discounted price:
\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted price:
\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:
\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon needs:**
   Shannon eats 2 cookies per night and wants enough cookies to last for 30 days.
   \[
   2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Convert the total number of cookies into dozens:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12.
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of madeleine cookies."
"To determine how many of Marcy's candles will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the percentage of candles that will explode:**
   - Marcy markets her candles as 99% guaranteed not to explode.
   - Therefore, 1% of the candles will explode.

2. **Calculate the number of candles that will explode:**
   - Total number of candles = 50,000
   - Percentage of candles that will explode = 1%
   - Number of candles that will explode = \( 50,000 \times \frac{1}{100} = 500 \)

3. **Identify the percentage of candles that smell like wet dog:**
   - 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

4. **Calculate the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode:**
   - Since the 5% that smell like wet dog are a subset of the more dangerous candles, and we are not given a specific percentage of the total candles that are more dangerous, we assume the 5% that smell like wet dog are part of the 1% that will explode.
   - Therefore, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is \( 500 \times \frac{5}{100} = 25 \).

Thus, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"First, we need to determine the discount price of each blouse. The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. To find the discount price, we calculate 30% of $20 and subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount per blouse is:
\[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discounted price per blouse is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for 4 blouses is:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the number of apples Joanne gathered from each type of tree:
- From the tallest trees, Joanne gathered 30 apples.
- From the shortest trees, Joanne gathered half the amount from the tallest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Let the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees be \( x \).

Next, we determine the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from each type of tree:
- From the tallest trees, her sister gathered twice as many as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- From the shortest trees, her sister gathered three times as many as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Her sister did not gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of apples as follows:
\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 150 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To eliminate \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides, we get:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled over the next two days, which was 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances traveled:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches, the size of Zack's locker as \( Z \) cubic inches, and the size of Peter's locker as \( P \) cubic inches.

From the problem, we know:
1. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so \( Z = \frac{1}{2}T \).
2. Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker, so \( P = \frac{1}{4}Z \).
3. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so \( P = 5 \).

First, substitute the value of \( P \) into the second equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{4}Z \]
To find \( Z \), multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ Z = 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
So, Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.

Next, substitute the value of \( Z \) into the first equation:
\[ Z = \frac{1}{2}T \]
\[ 20 = \frac{1}{2}T \]
To find \( T \), multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ T = 20 \times 2 = 40 \]
So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"First, we determine the elevation of the comb after it fell from Stanley's pocket. Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb's elevation is:

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find the difference in elevation between Oliver and the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:

\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from the two banks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the amount of money given by the first bank.
2. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
3. Add the amounts from the banks to his initial capital.

First, the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue's total capital now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

First, 4 boats came and each carried away 5 cats:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cats} \]

Subtract the 20 cats that were carried away from the initial 50 cats:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ cats} \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats} \]

Subtract the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining 30 cats:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ cats} \]

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months) at $14 per month:**
   \[
   10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs from each period:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$140 = \$284
\]

Thus, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{284}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Let's denote the savings from the tattered jeans as \( S_t \) and the savings from the jogger jeans as \( S_j \). According to the problem, Cole saved \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Therefore, we can write:
\[ S_j = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_t = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price. Let the original price of the tattered jeans be \( P_t \). The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and the savings from the tattered jeans is $4, so:
\[ P_t - 28 = 4 \]
\[ P_t = 32 \]

Similarly, the savings from the jogger jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price. Let the original price of the jogger jeans be \( P_j \). The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and the savings from the jogger jeans is $2, so:
\[ P_j - 22 = 2 \]
\[ P_j = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:
\[ P_j - P_t = 24 - 32 = -8 \]
Since the problem asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, we take the absolute value:
\[ |24 - 32| = 8 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees

3. **Minivans:**
   - Number of minivans: 10
   - Capacity per minivan: 15 employees
   - Total capacity for minivans: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) employees

Next, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:

\[
240 \text{ (buses)} + 180 \text{ (minibusses)} + 150 \text{ (minivans)} = 570 \text{ employees}
\]

Thus, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is \(\boxed{570}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder. According to the problem, each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds, and each bird feeder Lillian built attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought one. Therefore, each of Lillian's bird feeders attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Lillian has 3 bird feeders that she built and 3 store-bought bird feeders. We can now calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder.

For the bird feeders Lillian built:
\[ 3 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

For the store-bought bird feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:
\[ 90 \text{ birds} + 60 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which costs $4. 

The additional cost for the soup is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, the cost of the soup is:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the cake. The cake costs half the price of the bagel:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

1. **Determine the number of cards sold:**
   Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.
   \[
   \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{2}{3}x
   \]

2. **Calculate the total money from selling the cards:**
   Each card is sold for $1.5, so the total money from selling the cards is:
   \[
   \text{Total money from selling cards} = 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of money Kenny has after buying the ticket:**
   Kenny spends $100 on the ticket and is left with $50 in spending cash. Therefore, the total money he had before buying the ticket is:
   \[
   \text{Total money before buying the ticket} = 100 + 50 = 150
   \]

4. **Set up the equation:**
   The total money from selling the cards is equal to the total money before buying the ticket:
   \[
   x = 150
   \]

Thus, the number of cards Kenny started with is:
\[
\boxed{150}

"To determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared:**
   - The caterer prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - These 18 guests each get 2 hotdogs, so the caterer prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests each get 1 hotdog, so the caterer prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for these guests.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Determine the number of hotdogs needed for 40 guests:**
   - If 40 guests each want one hotdog, they need 40 hotdogs.
   - If 40 guests each want a second hotdog, they need an additional 40 hotdogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 + 40 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 40 guests each got one hotdog, using up 40 hotdogs.
   - This leaves \( 54 - 40 = 14 \) hotdogs for the second hotdog.
   - Since 40 guests want a second hotdog and only 14 hotdogs are available, \( 40 - 14 = 26 \) guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{26}
\]"
"First, we determine the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6.

Next, we calculate half of the letters in Indras' name:
\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Then, we find the number of letters in her sister's name, which is 4 more than half of Indras' name:
\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name to find the total:
\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

Thus, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:
\[
\boxed{13}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:
- Saved from allowance: $2
- Given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs:
\[ \text{Additional money needed} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total money Dora has} \]
\[ \text{Additional money needed} = $19 - $18 = $1 \]

So, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
\]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
\]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as follows:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

This means George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, so the total cost for 3 bags is:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars George bought is:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. This means he shared \(25 - 5 = 20\) lollipops with his four friends equally.

To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4:

\[20 \div 4 = 5\]

Each of his friends received 5 lollipops. 

Final numerical answer:
5"
"Rory's cake initially weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. When Rory and her mom each have a piece, 2 pieces are taken. Since the cake was divided equally into 8 pieces, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

So, the total weight of the 2 pieces taken by Rory and her mom is:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the cake is:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs \(\boxed{15}\) ounces."
"First, we need to determine the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti bought 34 oranges and Juris bought 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to find out how many people will be sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"First, let's determine the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for 4 pounds is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00/\text{servings} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Bernadette to be driven to the theater. According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, the drive for Bernadette will take:

\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, which means she needs to arrive 4 - 5 = -1 minutes, or simply 1 minute before Wayne's arrival time. However, since it takes Bernadette 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 minutes before Wayne leaves to ensure she arrives 1 minute before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 16 minutes earlier than Wayne. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, we can calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought as follows:

\[
1 \text{ pack of red beads} + 2 \text{ packs of clear beads} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Similarly, we can calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought as follows:

\[
3 \text{ packs of blue beads} + 4 \text{ packs of red beads} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth. We do this by subtracting the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:

\[
140 - 60 = 80
\]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the final temperature of the house.

1. **Initial Temperature:**
   Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Baking:**
   Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   \[
   \text{Temperature increase} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial temperature:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Temperature Decrease from Opening the Window:**
   Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   \[
   \text{Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 3 \text{ intervals}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Temperature decrease} = 3 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

The final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."

   Jon's time: 40 minutes

2. **Bike Ride:**
   Jon's time: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes

3. **Run:**
   Jon's time: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[
40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
\]

James finished 10% faster in the swim and 5 minutes longer in the bike ride.

4. **Swim:**
   James's time: \(40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes}\)

5. **Bike Ride:**
   James's time: \(80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes}\)

Let \(x\) be the time James took for the run.

Total time for James:
\[
36 + 85 + x
\]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[
36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
121 + x = 180
\]

Solve for \(x\):
\[
x = 180 - 121 = 59 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[
\boxed{59}

"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to \(1.25 \times 60 = 75\) minutes.

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:
\[75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes}\]

Now, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:
\[\frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the length of Movie A is \(\boxed{20}\) minutes."
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH).

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time} = 30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of hay the horse eats:**
   \[
   \text{Hay consumed} = \text{Distance} \times \text{Hay per mile}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hay per mile} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per bail} = \$3

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, we need to find out by how many points Joey is winning. We do this by subtracting Marcy's new total from Joey's new total:

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

So, Joey is now winning by \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers and then subtract the cost of purchasing the sneakers.

First, let's calculate the cost per sneaker:
\[
\text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of sneakers}} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
\[
\text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \text{ sneakers} \times 20 \text{ dollars per sneaker} = 340 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we determine the number of sneakers sold to the department store:
\[
\text{Number of sneakers sold to the department store} = 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers}
\]

We calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers to the department store:
\[
\text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \text{ sneakers} \times 25 \text{ dollars per sneaker} = 775 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we find the total revenue from all sales:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from flash sale} + \text{Revenue from department store} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}

\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

If you buy a regular movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price, the total cost is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the cost of the regular ticket and popcorn and soda is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket:
\[ 15 + P = 21 - 2 \]
\[ 15 + P = 19 \]
\[ P = 19 - 15 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"First, we need to determine the cost of filling one helium balloon before the price increase. We know that the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost of filling one balloon is:

"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then use the formula for average speed:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at each speed:

1. **First part of the trip:**
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance: \(60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}\)

2. **Second part of the trip:**
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance: \(30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}\)

Next, we add the distances to find the total distance:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
\]

Now, we add the times to find the total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
\]

Finally, we calculate the average speed:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
\]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is:

\[

"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she will have:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies she has. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the value of her 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Each ruby is worth $1200, and she has 2 rubies, so the value of her rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[
\boxed{6400}

"To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples Marin eats in 30 days.
2. Calculate the number of apples Nancy eats in 30 days.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total number of apples eaten by both in 30 days.

First, let's calculate the number of apples Marin eats in 30 days:
\[ \text{Number of apples Marin eats in 30 days} = 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of apples Nancy eats in 30 days:
\[ \text{Number of apples Nancy eats in 30 days} = 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we add the number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:
\[ \text{Total number of apples eaten by both in 30 days} = 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of one raised bed is given by:

\[
V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags}
\]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[
\boxed{1920}

To find 60% of 15:
\[ 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of green cards is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we sum up all the cards:
\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 39 \text{ (yellow)} = 78 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"

\[ \text{Total number of puppies} = 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, let's find the total number of puppies with spots:
\[ \text{Total number of puppies with spots} = 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we can calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:
\[ \text{Percentage of puppies with spots} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = \( 42 \times 75 = 3150 \) pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = \( 20 \times 65 = 1300 \) pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - The farmer buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
\[
3150 \text{ (hay)} + 1300 \text{ (oats)} + 48 \text{ (carrots)} + 2 \text{ (sugar cubes)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"First, we calculate the weekly earnings from recycling the aluminum cans and plastic bottles.

1. **Earnings from aluminum cans:**
   - Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
   - Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
   - Weekly earnings from aluminum cans: \( 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents} \).

2. **Earnings from plastic bottles:**
   - Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
   - Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - Weekly earnings from plastic bottles: \( 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \).

3. **Total weekly earnings:**
   - Total weekly earnings from both cans and bottles: \( 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents} \).

4. **Earnings over four weeks:**
   - Total earnings over four weeks: \( 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \).

1. Finley started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since a negative position doesn't make sense in this context, we interpret this as moving from 1st to 6th place (since she can't be in a negative position, she moves to the 6th place).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(6 + 2 = 8\). So, she is now in 8th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(8 - 3 = 5\). So, she is now in 5th place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(5 + 1 = 6\). So, she is now in 6th place.

Therefore, Finley finished the race in 6th place. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"First, we need to calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck. Therefore, the total number of basketball cards is:
\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards. She has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. Therefore, the total number of baseball cards is:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

Now, we find the total number of cards Miss Maria has by adding the basketball cards and the baseball cards:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:
\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \]

If each student receives 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is:
\[ \frac{300}{10} = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of students Miss Maria has is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

After applying the $1 discount, Becky paid:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

A 10 percent discount on $10 is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, after applying the 10 percent discount, Kelly paid:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[ 9 - 8 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforter per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets. Since each room has 2 sheets, the number of pillow cases is \(2 \times 2 = 4\).
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases. Since each room has 4 pillow cases, the number of towels is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

Now, we sum the number of each type of laundry item per room:
\[2 \text{ (sheets)} + 1 \text{ (comforter)} + 4 \text{ (pillow cases)} + 8 \text{ (towels)} = 15 \text{ pieces of laundry per room}.\]

To find the total number of pieces of laundry for 80 rooms, we multiply the number of pieces of laundry per room by the number of rooms:
\[15 \times 80 = 1200.\]

Thus, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is \(\boxed{1200}\)."

   He gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the number of shoes he receives is:
   \[
   5 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes per pair} = 10 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Adding these to his initial count:
   \[
   200 + 10 = 210 \text{ shoes}
   \]

3. **Shoes received on Wednesday:**
   He gains 15 pairs of shoes on Wednesday. The number of shoes he receives is:
   \[
   15 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes per pair} = 30 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Adding these to his current count:
   \[
   210 + 30 = 240 \text{ shoes}

"First, let's determine the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is:
\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. Therefore, the number of pencils used is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]
So, the number of pencils remaining after two months is:
\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. Therefore, the number of pencils left is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

Thus, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed by the equation:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate the term involving \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"First, we need to determine the combined length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to convert the combined length of the remoras from inches to feet, since the length of the shark is given in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
\[ 12 \text{ inches} = \frac{12}{12} \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage 1 foot is of the shark's body length, which is 10 feet. The percentage is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is \(\boxed{10}\) percent of the shark's body length."
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4} x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]

\[
x = 80
\]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is \(\boxed{80}\)."

"To determine how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's define the sets:
- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (the number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (the number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (the number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[
|D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P|
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
|D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Next, we need to find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything. The total number of kids in the class is 32. Therefore, the number of kids not allergic to anything is:
\[
32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel stay. The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it is a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. 

To find the increased price, we calculate 20% of $1500:
\[ 0.20 \times 1500 = 300 \]

So, the increased price per day is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel stay is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each plane ticket costs $5000, and since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to find the total cost of the trip:

\[ 83 + 91 = 174 \]

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they have already earned from their goal:

\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

Therefore, they need to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can hold up to 100 songs, the number of additional songs each can add is calculated by subtracting the number of songs they currently have from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel. This is done by subtracting the number of additional songs Luri can add from the number of additional songs Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{40}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of oats consumed by one horse per day. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, one horse consumes:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses per day. Since there are four horses, the total consumption per day is:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much oats are consumed by the horses over five days. The total consumption over five days is:

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 200 pounds of oats. The number of bags needed is:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days is:

"To determine the cost per razor after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost for 2 packs of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - She is buying 2 packs.
   \[
   2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
   \]

2. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale:**
   - Since the sale is ""buy one get one free,"" buying 2 packs means she only pays for 1 pack.
   \[
   \text{Cost after the sale} = \$4.00
   \]

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon from the sale price.
   \[
   \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - She is buying 2 packs.
   \[
   2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
   \]

5. **Determine the cost per razor:**
   - Divide the total cost by the total number of razors.
   \[
   \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
   \]

6. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - Since $1.00 = 100 \text{ cents}$, $0.25 \text{ dollars} = 25 \text{ cents}$.
   \[
   0.25 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 25 \text{ cents}

"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches, as she will be at the top of the human pyramid.

Next, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid is structured as follows:
- 4 cheerleaders on the bottom
- 3 cheerleaders on the next level
- 2 cheerleaders on the top level
- 1 cheerleader (the shortest) at the very top

Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. We will assume the 60-inch tall cheerleader is the one at the top of the pyramid.

The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders in each level:
- Bottom level: 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall
- Middle level: 3 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall
- Top level: 2 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall
- Top of the pyramid: 1 cheerleader, 60 inches tall

Calculating the height of each level:
- Bottom level: \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches
- Middle level: \(3 \times 64 = 192\) inches
- Top level: \(2 \times 64 = 128\) inches
- Top of the pyramid: \(60\) inches

Adding these together gives the total height of the pyramid:
\[256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}\]

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is \(\boxed{53}\) feet."

"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the cost of his morning and afternoon rides separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning each day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives in the morning for 14 days.

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[
6 \text{ dollars/ride} \times 14 \text{ rides} = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon each day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives in the afternoon for 14 days.

The total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[
2 \text{ dollars/ride} \times 14 \text{ rides} = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
\[
84 \text{ dollars} + 28 \text{ dollars} = 112 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[
\boxed{112}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box. Therefore, the total number of oranges Ashley brought is:
\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. Therefore, the total number of oranges Brianne brought is:
\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the number of oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne to find the total number of oranges they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many greek orange pies they can make, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges required for one pie. Since one greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( n \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25n \)

We need to find the number of guests, \( n \), for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

To solve for \( n \), we first isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Lily as \( L \), and by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together, they collected 43 insects: \( L + D + B = 43 \).
2. Lily found 7 more than David: \( L = D + 7 \).
3. David found half of what Bodhi found: \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) or equivalently \( B = 2D \).

We can substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation. From \( L = D + 7 \) and \( B = 2D \), we substitute these into \( L + D + B = 43 \):

\[
(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
4D + 7 = 43
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[
4D = 36
\]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[
D = 9
\]

Now that we know \( D = 9 \), we can find \( L \) and \( B \):

\[
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]
\[
B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

So, the number of insects Lily found is \( \boxed{16} \)."
"To determine the total number of yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used, we need to calculate the amount each of them used and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, the amount of yarn Mariah used is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. The amount of yarn her grandma used is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

Therefore, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:
\[
\boxed{273}

"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the number of gifts for the first 2 friends:
   Each of these 2 friends wants 5 gifts.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ gifts}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of gifts for the next 3 friends:
   Each of these 3 friends wants 2 gifts.
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ gifts}
   \]

3. Add the additional 10 random gifts:
   \[
   10 \text{ gifts}
   \]

4. Sum all the gifts together:
   \[
   10 \text{ (for the first 2 friends)} + 6 \text{ (for the next 3 friends)} + 10 \text{ (random gifts)} = 26 \text{ gifts}
   \]

Thus, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
\[
\boxed{26}

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Given that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, we can calculate the width of the rug as follows:

\[
\text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. We already know the width of the rug is 8 feet, so we can calculate twice the width of the rug:

\[
2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we add 2 feet to this value to find the length of the couch:

\[
\text{Length of the couch} = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[
\boxed{18}

"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry and one pack each of grape and green apple.

The cost of each pack of grape gum is given as $2. The cost of the green apple gum is half the cost of the grape gum, so it is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost of the gum is the sum of the costs of the strawberry, grape, and green apple packs. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the number of sticks he can get from the cheapest lumber and see how many sticks he can produce with his budget.

First, let's identify the cost and stick yield for each type of wood:
- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks.
- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks.

Since the 2 x 4 piece of wood is cheaper, Frederick should buy as many 2 x 4 pieces as possible within his $24 budget.

Next, we calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with $24:
\[
\frac{24}{4} = 6
\]
So, Frederick can buy 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

Now, we calculate the total number of sticks he can get from these 6 pieces:
\[
6 \times 200 = 1200
\]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:
\[
\boxed{1200}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of legs among Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$4.40 \text{ per day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$4.40 \text{ per day} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Next, we compare this cost to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20. The savings from buying the weekly bus pass is:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to verify the number of cows in the zoo. According to the information, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to verify the number of sheep on the farm. According to the information, the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the total number of animals on the farm is:
\[ 30 + 10 = 40 \]

The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so the total number of animals in the zoo is:
\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Adding the total number of animals from both the farm and the zoo, we get:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals the farm and zoo have combined is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by analyzing the information given:

1. Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
2. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( O \) and the number of potatoes she bought as \( P \).

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Therefore, we can write the following equations based on the information provided:

\[
4O = 12 \quad \text{(number of onions)}
\]
\[
4P = 4 \quad \text{(number of potatoes)}
\]

Next, we solve these equations for \( O \) and \( P \):

\[
O = \frac{12}{4} = 3
\]
\[
P = \frac{4}{4} = 1
\]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these quantities together:

\[
3 + 1 = 4
\]

Thus, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. Since it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calorie deficit required is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days available:**
   Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. We need to count the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

   - From December 31st to December 31st: 0 days
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July up to July 19th: 19 days

   Adding these together:
   \[
   0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate his total earnings for the week as follows:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100 during the week. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]
Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:
\[ 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]
So, after buying CDs, Julie has:
\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]
Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is \(\boxed{90000}\)."

\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue Tara earned from selling the canvas bags.

She sold each of the 40 canvas bags for $8, so the total revenue is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"

1. Calculate the number of punches Joe throws per round.
2. Multiply the number of punches per round by the number of rounds in the fight.

First, we know that Joe throws 25 punches per minute. Each round lasts 3 minutes. Therefore, the number of punches Joe throws in one round is:
\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ punches/round} \]

Next, the fight consists of 5 rounds. So, the total number of punches Joe throws in the entire fight is:
\[ 75 \text{ punches/round} \times 5 \text{ rounds} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

Thus, the total number of punches Joe threw is:
\[ \boxed{375} \]"

"First, let's calculate Ada's current daily electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50. Therefore, her current daily cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$18.00 \]

Next, we calculate her current weekly cost. Since there are 7 days in a week, her weekly cost is:
\[ \$18.00 \times 7 = \$126.00 \]

Now, let's calculate her new daily consumption after adding the device. The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so her total daily consumption will be:
\[ 12 \text{ kWh} + 2 \text{ kWh} = 14 \text{ kWh} \]

The new daily cost will be:
\[ 14 \text{ kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$21.00 \]

Her new weekly cost will be:
\[ \$21.00 \times 7 = \$147.00 \]

Finally, we find the difference between her new weekly cost and her original weekly cost:

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days for half a house means 10 days for a whole house).

Next, we need to find out the rate at which 5 people can paint a house. Since 5 people are working together, their combined rate is 5 times the rate of one person. Therefore, 5 people can paint a whole house in \(\frac{10}{5} = 2\) days.

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of chairs Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. If Ophelia has 20 sofas, then the number of chairs she has is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has is:
\[ 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Now, we need to find out how many sofas Jenna has. The problem states that Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, the number of sofas Jenna has is:
\[ 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. The total number of sofas is:
\[ 20 + 64 = 84 \]
The total number of chairs is:
\[ 22 + 66 = 88 \]
Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is:
\[ 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( x \).

The equation representing the total cost is:
\[ 4 + x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 48 - 4 \]
\[ x = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44. Now, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we need to determine how many CDs he could buy with $48. We do this by dividing $48 by the cost of one CD:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 12 CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the specific weeks where he worked out for different durations and the weeks where he worked out for the usual 4 hours.

1. **Calculate the hours for the usual weeks:**
   - Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for 6 weeks.
   - Total hours for these 6 weeks: \( 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \).

2. **Calculate the hours for the weeks with increased workout time:**
   - Josh worked out for 5 hours each for 2 consecutive weeks.
   - Total hours for these 2 weeks: \( 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \).
   - Additionally, he worked out for 6 hours in one week.
   - Total hours for this week: \( 6 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Sum up all the hours:**
   - Total hours from the usual weeks: 24 hours.
   - Total hours from the weeks with increased workout time: \( 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ hours} \).
   - Combined total: \( 24 \text{ hours} + 16 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \).

Thus, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of passengers on the bus:**
   \[
   48
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - 5 times as many passengers as those who got off get on the bus.
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   - Calculate the number of passengers after the first stop:
   \[
   48 - 8 + 40 = 80
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   - 21 passengers get off the bus.
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than those who got off.
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[ 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 \]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin:
\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700
\]

Next, let's denote the cost of one monitor as \( x \). Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the total cost for the monitors is:

\[
2x
\]

The total cost for the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is given as $2,400. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
1100 + 2x + 700 = 2400
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
1800 + 2x = 2400
\]

Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[
2x = 600
\]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 300
\]

Thus, the cost of one monitor is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"To determine how many seashells each girl brought, we start by identifying the number of seashells each boy brought, which is given as 60 seashells.

Next, we need to calculate the number of seashells each girl brought. According to the problem, each girl brought an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by a boy plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Let's denote the number of seashells each boy brought as \( B \) and the number of seashells each girl brought as \( G \).

Given:
\[ B = 60 \]

The number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ G = B + 4B \]

Substituting the value of \( B \):
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

Thus, each girl brought \(\boxed{300}\) seashells."

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is:
   \[
   50 \text{ mm} - 5 \text{ mm} = 45 \text{ mm}
   \]
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \text{ mm} = 62 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm} = 188 \text{ mm}
\]

The total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

So, Emma should make \(\boxed{18}\) vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."
"First, let's calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill.

\[
6 + 5 = 11
\]
The following day, he added another $10 to his share:
\[
11 + 10 = 21
\]
After that, he spent $8 from his total:
\[
21 - 8 = 13
\]
Next, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8:
\[
13 \times 3 = 39

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we start by noting that April has 30 days. The first half of April consists of the first 15 days, and the second half consists of the next 15 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April. Therefore, in the first half of April, he saves \( 15x \) dollars.

In the second half of April, Elvis saves twice as much each day as he does in the first half. So, he saves \( 2x \) dollars each day in the second half. Therefore, in the second half of April, he saves \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \) dollars.

Elvis's total savings for the month of April is the sum of his savings in the first half and the second half, which is given as $1125. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves \( x = 25 \) dollars each day in the first half of April. Since he saves twice as much each day in the second half, he saves \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \) dollars each day in the second half of April.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples, oranges, and peaches that Verna bought.

1. **Cost of apples:**
   - Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
   \[
   3 \times 1.50 = 4.50
   \]

2. **Cost of oranges:**
   - Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
   \[
   5 \times 0.80 = 4.00
   \]

3. **Cost of peaches:**
   - Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
   \[
   6 \times 0.75 = 4.50
   \]

Next, we add up the total cost of all the fruits:
\[
4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00
\]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
\[
20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
\]

Thus, the change Verna received is:
\[
\boxed{7.00}

- Jenny earns $0.5 per task.
- She completed 20 tasks.

\[
\text{Jenny's total earnings} = 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's total earnings:

\[
\text{Difference} = 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Jairus will get \(\boxed{6}\) dollars more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money they have to divide is 100 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as follows:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"First, let's determine the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water. Since it takes him 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, we can calculate the time it takes in warm water as follows:

\[ \text{Time in warm water for 1 mile} = 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day. We start by calculating the total time for 3 miles in both conditions.

For cold water:
\[ \text{Time for 3 miles in cold water} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ \text{Time for 3 miles in warm water} = 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's determine the number of buttons that have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the remaining buttons have four holes. We can calculate the number of buttons with four holes as follows:

\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with two holes. Since there are 7 buttons with 2 holes each, the total number of holes from these buttons is:

\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with four holes. Since there are 14 buttons with 4 holes each, the total number of holes from these buttons is:

\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Finally, we add the holes from both groups of buttons to get the total number of holes in the bag:

\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:

Adding these together, the total number of rodents is \(30 + 15 = 45\).

So, the pet shop has 45 rodents in total."
"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Therefore, Susan's weight is:
   \[
   150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Therefore, Bob's weight is:
   \[
   2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3:
\[
\frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the average weight of the three friends is:
\[
\boxed{180}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun:**
   The initial angle of the sun from the ground is the same as the angle of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees.

2. **Rate of Movement:**
   The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

3. **Total Movement in 10 Hours:**
   Over 10 hours, the sun will move:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **Final Angle of the Sun:**
   Adding the movement to the initial angle:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is:
\[
\boxed{82}

"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. Therefore, the age of the younger son is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs one candle per year, the total number of candles required is:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so the number of packs required is:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total amount James spends on candles is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, the reading rate is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \]

Using this rate, the number of pages she read in the first week is:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \times 105 \text{ minutes} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \). According to the problem, Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so we have \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). The problem states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be written as the equation:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( N \) by first dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ \frac{51}{3} = N + 7 \]
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Then, we isolate \( N \) by subtracting 7 from both sides:
\[ 17 - 7 = N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently \(\boxed{10}\) years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00.
   - Therefore, for three teeth, the total amount is:
     \[
     3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Since the previous three teeth each received $1.00, half of that amount is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, for two teeth, the total amount is:
     \[
     2 \times 0.50 = 1 \text{ dollar}
     \]

4. **Total Amount:**
   - Adding up all the amounts:
     \[
     5 + 3 + 1 = 9 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is \(\boxed{9}\) dollars."
"To determine the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we start by identifying the number of goals each teenager scored.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[
\text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60
\]

Next, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[
\text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35
\]

Now, we sum the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[
\boxed{175}
\]"

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times \$4 \text{ per lemonade} = \$84 \]

Next, we know that Liam made $63. To find out how much more money Mitchell made compared to Liam, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made:

\[ \$84 - \$63 = \$21 \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and he has $70 to spend over 7 days, he spends:

\[
\frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
\]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends:

\[
10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[
\frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures}
\]

After spending $40, the remaining amount of money is:

\[
70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[
\frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures}
\]

Therefore, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[
8 \text{ wooden action figures} + 15 \text{ plastic action figures} = 23 \text{ action figures}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

1. **Spaying cost**: $200
2. **Cost of 3 vaccines**: Each vaccine costs $20, so for 3 vaccines, the cost is:
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
3. **Cost of 4 broken vases**: Each vase costs $12, so for 4 vases, the cost is:
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48
   \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week:

- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many roses Ford grows in a month. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we calculate:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 160 \text{ roses/month} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of roses needed by the flower shops in a month:
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 260 \text{ roses/month} \]

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses Ford grows in a month from the number of roses needed:
\[ 260 \text{ roses/month} - 160 \text{ roses/month} = 100 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, Ford lacks \(\boxed{100}\) roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To determine how much money Katina will have in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Katina removes from her account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total amount from her initial savings.

First, we know that Katina removes $100 from her account every month. There are 12 months in a year, so over 2 years, the total number of months is:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money removed over these 24 months:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times 100 \text{ dollars/month} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial savings of $3000:
\[ 3000 \text{ dollars} - 2400 \text{ dollars} = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = \( 10 \text{ sandwiches} \times \$7.00 \text{ per sandwich} = \$70.00 \).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost of bread: Each loaf of bread costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = \( \frac{\$3.00}{10 \text{ sandwiches}} \times 10 \text{ sandwiches} = \$3.00 \).
   - The cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = \$30.00.
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = \( \$3.00 + \$30.00 = \$33.00 \).

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Net profit = \( \$70.00 - \$33.00 = \$37.00 \).

The net profit is \(\boxed{37}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total area of Michael's bedroom. The area is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given the dimensions of the bedroom are 18 feet by 12 feet, the area is:

\[ \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the new carpet, including the padding. The cost per square foot for the carpet and padding is:

\[ \text{Cost per square foot} = \$12 + \$2 = \$14 \]

So, the total cost for the carpet and padding is:

\[ \text{Total cost for carpet and padding} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$14/\text{square foot} = 216 \times 14 = \$3024 \]

Now, we calculate the cost for removing the old carpet. The contractor charges $4 per square foot for removal, so the total removal cost is:

\[ \text{Total removal cost} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = 216 \times 4 = \$864 \]

Finally, we calculate the installation cost. The contractor charges $34 per square foot for installation, so the total installation cost is:

\[ \text{Total installation cost} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = 216 \times 34 = \$7344 \]

Adding all these costs together gives the total cost for replacing the carpet:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$3024 + \$864 + \$7344 = \$11232 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{11232} \]"

"Let's denote the starting value of the number train as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 20 \).

The steps to find the final value are as follows:

1. Calculate half of the starting value: \(\frac{x}{2}\).
2. Add this value to the starting value: \( x + \frac{x}{2} \).
3. Divide the result by 5: \(\frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5}\).
4. Subtract 12 from the starting value: \( x - 12 \).
5. Multiply the result from step 3 by the result from step 4: \(\left(\frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5}\right) \times (x - 12)\).

Now, let's substitute \( x = 20 \) into the expression and simplify step by step.

1. Calculate half of 20: \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\).
2. Add this value to 20: \(20 + 10 = 30\).
3. Divide the result by 5: \(\frac{30}{5} = 6\).
4. Subtract 12 from 20: \(20 - 12 = 8\).

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. The actual temperature when set to 450 is 468. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine the actual temperature the oven would reach if set to \( x \) degrees, and we know this should be 520 degrees. Since the oven is 4% too hot, the actual temperature is 104% of the setting:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then sum them up.

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
   \[
   60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is 120 minutes, the second movie is:
   \[
   120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Adding the durations of the two movies together:
   \[
   90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes}

"To determine the value of Juan's house, we start by noting that Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house. This means that Juan's house is 70% of the value of Herb's house.

First, we calculate the value of Juan's house:
\[
\text{Value of Juan's house} = 70\% \times 76000 = 0.70 \times 76000 = 53200
\]

Next, we find the combined value of both houses by adding the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house:
\[
\text{Combined value} = 76000 + 53200 = 129200
\]

Thus, the value of the two houses combined is:
\[
\boxed{129200}

"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought to the event.

Judy bought a dozen cups. Since a dozen is 12, Judy brought:
\[ 12 \text{ cups} \]

Judy also bought twice as many dishes as cups. Therefore, the number of dishes she brought is:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ dishes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cups and dishes Judy's friend brought.

Judy's friend brought 40 cups. Additionally, Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought:
\[ 24 + 20 = 44 \text{ dishes} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

The total number of cups brought by both is:
\[ 12 + 40 = 52 \text{ cups} \]

The total number of dishes brought by both is:
\[ 24 + 44 = 68 \text{ dishes} \]

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:
\[ 52 + 68 = 120 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils brought by the two is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

- Sunday: Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
- Total hours for John: \(4 + 3 = 7\) hours

Next, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John.

**Jill's Earnings:**
- Rate: $10 per hour
- Total earnings: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars}\)

**John's Earnings:**
- Rate: $10 per hour
- Total earnings: \(7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars}\)

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

**Difference in Earnings:**
- John's earnings: $70

"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories}\)

Next, we add the calories burned from both activities:
\[1000 \text{ calories} + 600 \text{ calories} = 1600 \text{ calories}\]

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we set up the following proportion:
\[
\frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{160000 \text{ ml}}{200} = 800 \text{ ml}
\]

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink \(\boxed{800}\) ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. So, we can write the equation:
\[
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
3B = 4500
\]
Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[
B = 1500
\]
Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. The number of red jelly beans is:
\[
0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485
\]
The number of green jelly beans is:
\[
1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515
\]
To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[
1515 - 1485 = 30
\]
Thus, the number of green jelly beans that the jar contains more than the red jelly beans is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's identify the three measurements of Jared's typing speed:
1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Next, we calculate the average of these three measurements. The formula for the average is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements.

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

First, we find the sum of the measurements:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Then, we divide the sum by the number of measurements (which is 3):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

So, the average of the three measurements is:

\[
\boxed{52}

  1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in weight change between the two scenarios:
- The difference in weight change is:
  \[
  8.75 \text{ pounds} - (-6.25 \text{ pounds}) = 8.75 \text{ pounds} + 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Thus, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and eating Cheerios is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. **Email Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people via email.
   - Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people invited by email is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Phone Invitations:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people from phone invitations is \(8\) (the friends) + \(8\) (their spouses) = \(16\).

3. **Total Number of People:**
   - The total number of people who will be attending the event is the sum of the initial 100 people, the 200 additional people invited by email, and the 16 additional people from phone invitations.
   - Therefore, the total number of people is \(100 + 200 + 16 = 316\).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's calculate the weight of each dog step by step.

1. The weight of the Affenpinscher is given as 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. Therefore, the weight of the Dachshund is:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. Therefore, the weight of the Papillon is:
   \[
   \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is:
   \[
   44 \times 5 = 220 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the weight of the Mastiff is \(\boxed{220}\) pounds."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the boots and shipping on Amazon.com:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the boots and shipping on eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the cost of the shipping on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we need to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon:
- The difference in cost is $21 (eBay) - $20 (Amazon) = $1.

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the protein content per day:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - Each 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms is:
     \[
     \frac{200 \text{ grams}}{100 \text{ grams}} \times 3 \text{ grams of protein} = 2 \times 3 \text{ grams of protein} = 6 \text{ grams of protein}
     \]

2. **Calculate the protein content per week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - John consumes 6 grams of protein each day.
   - Therefore, the protein content in a week is:
     \[
     6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week}
     \]

"Let's denote Jerry's current age by \( x \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x = 2(x - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
1. Distribute the 2 on the right side of the equation:
\[ x = 2x - 10 \]
2. Subtract \( x \) from both sides to isolate the variable term on one side:
\[ 0 = x - 10 \]
3. Add 10 to both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be \(\boxed{13}\) years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. **Cost of the implants:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants.
   \[
   2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the crown:**
   - The crown for one of the implants costs an extra $500.
   \[
   500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total cost of the dental work:**
   - Add the cost of the implants and the crown.
   \[
   4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Amount already paid:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   \[
   4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Hourly wage and required hours:**
   - George makes $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage.

   \]

Therefore, George needs to work \(\boxed{260}\) hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle in the triangle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the measures of the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"

"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. The speed \( v \) of the plane can be calculated using the formula:

\[ v = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ v = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]

Substituting the distance and speed:

\[ \text{time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional \(\boxed{5}\) hours to travel 2000 miles."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \text{Pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we first find out how many pounds Marissa makes in two hours:

\[ \text{Pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in two hours} = 120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in one hour by dividing 90 by 2:

\[ \text{Pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in one hour} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make in 12 hours. Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes:

\[ \text{Pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in 12 hours} = 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes:

\[ \text{Pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in 12 hours} = 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts together, the total amount of chocolates they made together is:

\[ \text{Total pounds of chocolates} = 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"

1. **Monday's Spending:**
   Howard spends $8 at the arcade on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Spending:**
   On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday. Therefore, the amount spent on Tuesday is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Wednesday's Spending:**
   On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday. Therefore, the amount spent on Wednesday is:
   \[
   4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Spending:**
   To find the total amount spent over the three days, we add the amounts spent each day:
   \[

   \]

5. **Initial Amount:**
   Howard originally had $100.

6. **Remaining Amount:**
   To find out how much money Howard has left, we subtract the total amount spent from his initial amount:
   \[
   100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Howard has left is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, we need to determine the total number of washings that 2 pumps of shampoo provide, which is given as 120 washings. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, then 2 pumps will last for 2 washes. Therefore, the 120 washings that 2 pumps provide will last for 120 / 2 = 60 washes if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash.

Next, we need to find out how much each pump costs. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, and this amount is for 120 washings. Since 2 pumps provide 120 washings, each pump provides 120 / 2 = 60 washings. The cost per pump is therefore $24.00 / 2 = $12.00.

To convert the cost per pump into cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
$12.00 * 100 = 1200 cents.

Thus, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\)."
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy. The shirt originally costs $25 and there is a 30% discount on it. The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the price of the shirt after the discount is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts cost $35 and there is no discount on them, so the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, we add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the items:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend, but the total cost of the items is $52.50. Since the total cost exceeds the amount Joe has, he does not have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:
\[ 50 - 52.50 = -2.50 \]

Since the question asks for the amount of money Joe will have left, and he will be short by $2.50, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{-2.50} \]"

"First, we calculate the cost to repave Monica's street. Monica's street is 150 meters long, and it costs $194 per meter to repave. Therefore, the cost to repave Monica's street is:
\[ 150 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 29100 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, and it also costs $194 per meter to repave. Therefore, the cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 95060 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference in cost between repaving Lewis' street and repaving Monica's street:
\[ 95060 \text{ dollars} - 29100 \text{ dollars} = 65960 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to repave Lewis' street is $65960 more than the cost to repave Monica's street. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

1. **Initial Funding and Duration:**
   - John receives initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, so the total duration of the research is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) months.

2. **Funding for the Remaining Months:**
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - For the remaining \(50 - 5 = 45\) months, the funding per month is 50% more than the initial funding.
   - The increased funding per month is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Cost for the first 5 months: \(100,000\)
   - Cost for the remaining 45 months: \(45 \times 150,000 = 6,750,000\)

4. **Summing Up the Costs:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 5 months + Cost for the remaining 45 months
   - Total cost = \(100,000 + 6,750,000 = 6,850,000\)

Thus, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{6850000}\)."
"To determine the total amount of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to calculate the amount of meat each player ate and then sum these amounts.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the amounts of meat consumed by the first three players:
\[6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Thus, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"First, let's determine how many loads of laundry Gary does in a year. Since he does laundry twice a week, we can calculate the number of loads per year as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water is used in a year. Since each load uses 20 gallons of water, the total water usage per year is:

\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the water used. Since a gallon of water costs $0.15, the total cost for the water used in a year is:

\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, the amount Gary spends on water for laundry in a year is:

2. **After the second week**: The beanstalk doubles in height. So, the height becomes \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
3. **After the third week**: The beanstalk grows an additional 4 inches. So, the height becomes \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches.

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in a day. Since he sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, the total amount of meat he sells in a day is:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the 750 kg of meat from Bill's bull. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from Bill's bull.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

This means 18 seats were occupied by the administrators. To find out how many seats were left after the administrators took their seats, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how many seats were left for the students. We subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of street lights across all intersections.

1. Each pole has 4 street lights.
2. Each intersection has 6 poles.
3. There are 4 intersections.

The total number of poles is:
\[ 6 \text{ poles/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 24 \text{ poles} \]

The total number of street lights is:
\[ 24 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights/pole} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

Next, we need to find the number of functioning street lights. If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ total street lights} - 20 \text{ not working street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is:
\[ \boxed{76} \]"
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play times for each DVD and then sum them up.

1. The first DVD has been played 356 times and can be played 1000 times before it breaks. Therefore, the remaining play times for the first DVD are:
   \[
   1000 - 356 = 644
   \]

2. The second DVD has been played 135 times and can be played 1000 times before it breaks. Therefore, the remaining play times for the second DVD are:
   \[
   1000 - 135 = 865
   \]

3. The total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is the sum of the remaining play times of both DVDs:
   \[
   644 + 865 = 1509
   \]

Thus, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is \(\boxed{1509}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy. He went twice a week for 2 hours each session.

Each session is 2 hours long, and he had 2 sessions per week. Therefore, the number of hours per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/session} \times 2 \text{ sessions/week} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \]

John attended physical therapy for 6 weeks, so the total number of hours over the 6 weeks is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

The cost per hour for the physical therapy sessions is $125. Therefore, the total cost for 24 hours is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day.

1. **Initial amount of gum:**
   Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum chewed at school:**
   Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum chewed on the way home:**
   Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school.

4. **Gum chewed after dinner:**
   Jim chews 1 piece of gum after dinner.

5. **Total gum chewed by the end of the day:**
   Adding up all the pieces of gum chewed:
   \[
   4 \text{ (school)} + 1 \text{ (on the way home)} + 1 \text{ (after dinner)} = 6 \text{ pieces}
   \]

6. **Gum remaining before giving to his sister:**
   Subtract the total pieces chewed from the initial amount:

\[
10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers per row} = 200 \text{ flowers}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. Therefore, we calculate 4/5 of 200:

\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160
\]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:

\[
\boxed{160}

"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s:**
   - Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb/s.
   - Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we convert kb to Mb by dividing by 1000.
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
   \]

2. **Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h:**
   - There are 3600 seconds in an hour.
   - To find the speed in Mb per hour, we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600.
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h}
   \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is \(\boxed{72}\) Mb per hour."
"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. Calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days:
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. Calculate the number of cars towed in the remaining four days:
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
     \[
     6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. Calculate the total number of cars towed in the week:
   - Add the number of cars towed in the first three days to the number of cars towed in the remaining four days:
     \[
     30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}

The total number of cars towed that week is \(\boxed{54}\)."
"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more Adam needs to grow to reach the required height of 4 feet:

\[ \text{Height needed} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will need to wait \(\boxed{4}\) years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster."
"First, let's calculate the total cost the company paid to acquire the cars. Since the company paid 30% of the price of each car, and each car cost $25,000, the cost per car is:
\[ 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
Since James sold 10 cars, the total cost for the company is:
\[ 7,500 \times 10 = 75,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars. Since each car was sold for $25,000 and he sold 10 cars, the total revenue is:
\[ 25,000 \times 10 = 250,000 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profit. Therefore, his commission is:
\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

So, the amount James made is:
\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many of the 100 riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so the remaining 40% must be men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{40}{100} \times 25 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"First, let's determine the price of the gold jewel. Given that the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel, and the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we need to find the total price for all three jewels. We add the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Thus, the total price for all three jewels is:

\[
\boxed{4800}

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, we need to find the total number of stamps Max bought. We do this by adding the number of each type of stamp together:

\[
16 \text{ (snowflake stamps)} + 19 \text{ (truck stamps)} + 10 \text{ (rose stamps)} = 45
\]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

1. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
   - Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
   \[

2. Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi. So, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from the number of fish Naomi caught.
   \[
   \text{Darren's fish} = 17 - 6 = 11
   \]

3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught by adding 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.
   \[
   \text{Tommy's fish} = 11 + 3 = 14
   \]

Therefore, the number of fish Tommy caught is \(\boxed{14}\)."

2. **Determine the maximum allowable cost per class:**
   The maximum allowable cost per class is $10.

3. **Calculate the total number of classes:**
   There are 10 total classes.

4. **Calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can attend to keep the cost per class at or below $10:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can attend. The cost per class is given by:
   \[
   \frac{60}{x} \leq 10
   \]

5. **Solve the inequality for \( x \):**
   \[
   \frac{60}{x} \leq 10
   \]
   Multiply both sides by \( x \) (assuming \( x > 0 \)):
   \[
   60 \leq 10x
   \]
   Divide both sides by 10:
   \[
   6 \leq x
   \]
   This means Manny can attend at least 6 classes.

6. **Determine the number of classes Manny can miss:**
   If Manny can attend at least 6 classes, the number of classes he can miss is:
   \[
   10 - 6 = 4
   \]

Therefore, Manny can miss \(\boxed{4}\) classes before the cost per class exceeds $10."
"First, let's determine the number of customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers each of them processes in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers weekly, and Julie processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers weekly.

To find the total weekly production for the two of them, we add the weekly totals together:
\[350 + 700 = 1050\]

Thus, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is \(\boxed{1050}\)."
"To determine how many miles Lynn ran, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify how many miles Paisley ran.
2. Calculate how many miles Reggie ran based on the information given.
3. Use the information about Reggie's run to find out how many miles Lynn ran.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. Therefore, the total cost for the suits is:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants. Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit. Since each suit costs $750, each dress pant costs:
\[ \frac{750}{5} = 150 \]
James buys 10 dress pants, so the total cost for the dress pants is:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he has 10 suits, so he buys:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost for the dress shirts is:

"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of flour in one bag.
2. Multiply the amount of flour in one bag by three to find the total amount of flour in three bags.

First, we know that each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. Therefore, the total amount of flour in one bag is:
\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to find the total amount of flour in three bags. Since each bag contains 16 kilograms, the total amount of flour in three bags is:
\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 16 \text{ kilograms per bag} = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

Thus, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"To determine the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each person biked separately and then sum these distances.

First, we calculate the distance Alisa biked:
\[
\text{Distance Alisa biked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 12 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours}
\]
\[
12 \times 4.5 = 54 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance Stanley biked:
\[
\text{Distance Stanley biked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours}
\]
\[
10 \times 2.5 = 25 \, \text{miles}
\]

Now, we sum the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley:
\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance Alisa biked} + \text{Distance Stanley biked} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles}
\]
\[
54 + 25 = 79 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is:
\[
\boxed{79}

"To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time required to dig through the soil and the time required to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time required to dig through the soil:
- Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

The time to dig through the soil is:
\[
\text{Time through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time required to dig through the clay:
- Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil. Therefore, his rate through clay is:
\[
\text{Rate through clay} = \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour}
\]
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

The time to dig through the clay is:
\[
\text{Time through clay} = \frac{\text{Distance through clay}}{\text{Rate through clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Finally, we sum the times to find the total time required to dig the well:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time through soil} + \text{Time through clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"

1. Howie will buy 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate) for each person.
2. The people include Howie, his teacher, and his 25 classmates, making a total of 27 people.

First, we calculate the total number of cupcakes needed for each person:
\[ 2 \text{ cupcakes/person} \]

Next, we multiply the number of cupcakes per person by the total number of people:
\[ 2 \text{ cupcakes/person} \times 27 \text{ people} = 54 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Therefore, Howie should buy:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Likes**: Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo after 1 week.

2. **Likes After 3 Weeks**: Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes.
   \[
   \text{Likes after 3 weeks} = 70 \times 2000 = 140000
   \]

3. **Additional Likes Recently**: She received 20000 more new likes recently.
   \[
   \text{Total likes} = \text{Likes after 3 weeks} + \text{Additional likes} = 140000 + 20000 = 160000
   \]

So, the total number of Instagram likes is:
\[
\boxed{160000}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday.

1. **Clara's Purchase:**
   - Number of pomegranates: 20
   - Price per pomegranate: $20
   - Total cost before voucher: \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \) dollars
   - Voucher discount: $2
   - Total cost after voucher: \( 400 - 2 = 398 \) dollars

2. **Sheila's Purchase:**
   - Number of pomegranates: 20
   - Price per pomegranate: $30
   - Total cost before discount: \( 20 \times 30 = 600 \) dollars
   - Discount: 10%
   - Discount amount: \( 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \) dollars
   - Total cost after discount: \( 600 - 60 = 540 \) dollars

3. **Difference in Final Prices:**
   - Clara's final cost: $398
   - Sheila's final cost: $540
   - Difference: \( 540 - 398 = 142 \) dollars

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is \(\boxed{142}\)."
"To determine the total amount Ariane made in two months, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariane's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.
   - Let \( G \) be the sales from green hats in the first month.
   - Therefore, \( 400 = \frac{1}{2}G \).
   - Solving for \( G \):
     \[
     G = 400 \times 2 = 800
     \]

2. **Calculate the total sales in the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \)

3. **Determine the sales in the second month:**
   - Sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales in the first month.
   - Total sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \)

4. **Calculate the total sales over the two months:**
   - Total sales over two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
   - Total sales over two months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \)

Thus, the total amount Ariane made in two months is \(\boxed{2100}\)."
"James hires the horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first hour costs $15.
- Each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour, so each additional hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.

Now, we calculate the total cost:
- The cost for the first hour is $15.
- The cost for the next two hours is $30 per hour, so for two hours it is $30 * 2 = $60.

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 15 + 60 = 75 \]

So, the total amount James paid is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial amount in Sally's bank account at the start of the week.
2. Identify the final amount in Sally's bank account at the end of the week.
3. Determine the amount of money that was added to her bank account during the week.
4. Calculate the difference between her expected wage and the amount added to her bank account to find out how much was withheld.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The initial amount in Sally's bank account at the start of the week is $200.
2. The final amount in Sally's bank account at the end of the week is $420.
3. The amount of money that was added to her bank account during the week is the final amount minus the initial amount:
   \[
   420 - 200 = 220
   \]
4. Sally's expected weekly wage is $300. The amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her expected wage and the amount added to her bank account:
   \[
   300 - 220 = 80
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money withheld from Sally's wage is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   \[
   3 \text{ halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ halves}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs required:**
   - 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Convert the number of eggs to dozens:**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

\]

Since the total number of pages required is 15, the number of pages she has left to write is:

\[
15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages}
\]

So, Shiela has \(\boxed{10}\) pages left to write."
"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days required for Mike to read the entire 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

First, we calculate the total number of days required to read the book:
\[
\text{Total pages} = 200
\]
\[
\text{Pages per day} = 10
\]
\[
\text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20
\]

Mike needs 20 days to read the entire book. The assignment is to be completed within 30 days. Therefore, we need to find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading:
\[
\text{Days before the deadline} = 30 - 20 = 10
\]

Thus, Mike will finish his reading \(\boxed{10}\) days before the deadline."
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   \[
   \text{Initial cost} = \$150,000
   \]

2. **Monthly Hanger Rental Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly hanger rental} = \$5000
   \]

3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly fuel cost} = 2 \times \$5000 = \$10,000
   \]

Next, we calculate the total monthly cost for maintaining the plane:
\[
\text{Total monthly cost} = \text{Monthly hanger rental} + \text{Monthly fuel cost} = \$5000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the first year (12 months):
\[
\text{Total annual maintenance cost} = 12 \times \$15,000 = \$180,000
\]

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total annual maintenance cost:
\[
\text{Total cost for the first year} = \text{Initial cost} + \text{Total annual maintenance cost} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000
\]

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{330000}

"Let's denote the time it took to cook rice as \( R \), the time it took to cook pork as \( P \), and the time it took to cook beans as \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \( B = \frac{P + R}{2} \).

First, we calculate the time it took to cook pork:
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it took to cook beans:
\[ B = \frac{P + R}{2} = \frac{50 + 30}{2} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the total time it took to cook all the food:
\[ R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time it took to cook all the food is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts compared to a mixture of \( \frac{1}{5} \) pound almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture:
- The cost of \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- The cost of \( \frac{1}{5} \) pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the mixture of \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts costs \( \boxed{3} \) dollars more than the mixture of \( \frac{1}{5} \) pound almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts."
"Let's denote the number of sheep by \( S \) and the number of geese by \( G \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20. Since each animal has one head, we have:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of animal legs is 70. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, so we have:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   S = 15
   \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
   \[
   15 + G = 20
   \]
   \[
   G = 5
   \]

To verify, we check the number of legs:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70
   \]
The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate:

\[ 5 + (5 \times 0.20) = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Therefore, he buys 7 pounds of coffee. The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:

\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

In addition to the coffee, Roger buys a donut for $2. So, the total cost is the sum of the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut:

\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"

The total number of newspapers delivered in a day is 600. The number of newspapers delivered to District A is 198, and to District C is 209. Let's denote the number of newspapers delivered to District B as \( x \).

The equation to find \( x \) is:
\[ 600 = 198 + x + 209 \]

First, we add the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C:
\[ 198 + 209 = 407 \]

Now, we subtract this sum from the total number of newspapers:
\[ x = 600 - 407 \]
\[ x = 193 \]

So, the number of newspapers delivered to District B is \(\boxed{193}\)."

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. The rest of the teachers are math teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."

"To determine how many good days were left in the month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of days and the given mood distribution:**
   - Total days in the month: 30
   - Good days: 12
   - Bad days: 8
   - Neutral days: The rest of the days

2. **Calculate the number of neutral days:**
   \[
   \text{Neutral days} = \text{Total days} - \text{Good days} - \text{Bad days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Neutral days} = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10
   \]

3. **Verify the initial mood distribution:**
   - First 8 days: Good
   - Next 8 days: Bad
   - Following 8 days: Neutral
   - Remaining 6 days: Neutral (since 30 - 24 = 6)

4. **Adjust the neutral days count based on the remaining days:**
   - The problem states the first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the following 8 days were neutral.
   - The remaining 6 days are neutral, but the problem states the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.
   - Therefore, the neutral days are:
     \[
     8 \text{ (initial neutral days)} - 3 \text{ (neutral days in the last 3 days)} = 5 \text{ neutral days}
     \]

5. **Calculate the new total number of good days:**
   - Initial good days: 12
   - Additional good days in the last 3 days: 2
   - Total good days:
     \[
     12 + 2 = 14
     \]

6. **Determine the number of good days left in the month:**
   - Since the total number of good days is 14 and the initial count was 12, the number of good days left is:
     \[
     14 - 12 = 2
     \]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ J = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books, so we can substitute \( J \) with 21:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve the equation for \( S \). First, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the current height of the bamboo is:
\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the additional height the bamboo needs to reach 600 inches. This is calculated as:
\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow an additional 360 inches, we divide the additional height needed by the daily growth rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many toys James needs in total.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter.
   - Total dogs initially: \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - Total toys needed initially: 12.

2. **First Purchase:**
   - James buys toys for the 12 dogs.
   - Total toys after first purchase: 12.

3. **Second Visit:**
   - There are twice as many more dogs as when he left.
   - Twice as many more dogs as 8 is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).
   - Total dogs now: \(12 + 16 = 28\).
   - Additional toys needed: \(28 - 12 = 16\).
   - Total toys after second purchase: \(12 + 16 = 28\).

4. **Third Visit:**
   - 3 dogs are gone.
   - Total dogs now: \(28 - 3 = 25\).
   - No additional toys are needed since the number of dogs is now 25 and he already has 28 toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"First, let's determine the total initial investment amount, which is $1200.

Dylan invests \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount. Therefore, Dylan's investment is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
\]

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:
\[
1200 - 480 = 720
\]

Frances then invests \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount. Therefore, Frances's investment is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480
\]

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:
\[
720 - 480 = 240
\]

Skyler's investment is the rest of the remaining amount, which is:
\[
240
\]

Thus, Skyler's investment is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"To determine how many more signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have.
2. Subtract the current total from their goal to find out how many more signatures they need.

First, let's find the total number of signatures they currently have:
\[ 20 \text{ (Carol's signatures)} + 44 \text{ (Jennifer's signatures)} = 64 \text{ signatures} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to reach 100:
\[ 100 \text{ (goal)} - 64 \text{ (current total)} = 36 \text{ signatures} \]

Therefore, the sisters need to collect \(\boxed{36}\) more signatures to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate how much Karen earns in 6 hours at a rate of $20 per hour:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{120}

"To determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we start by finding out how many hash browns can be made from one potato. Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the number of hash browns per potato as follows:

\[
\text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato}
\]

Next, we use this ratio to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:

\[
\text{Hash browns from 96 potatoes} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{576}
\]"
"First, calculate the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack.

Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 \, \text{kg} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight (assuming Jack is also an adult):
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by:
\[ \boxed{20 \, \text{kg}} \]"
"Let's start by defining the number of cookies each person has in terms of the Cookie Monster's cookies. Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, Max has \( C + 12 \) cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. So, Katarina has \( (C + 12) - 5 = C + 7 \) cookies.
3. We are given that Katarina has 68 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   C + 7 = 68
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 68 - 7 = 61
   \]
   So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Now, we can find the number of cookies Max has:
\[
C + 12 = 61 + 12 = 73
\]
So, Max has 73 cookies.

Next, we find the number of cookies Summer has:
\[
C + 12 + 23 = 61 + 23 = 84
\]
So, Summer has 84 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies they have by adding the cookies each person has:
\[
68 + 73 + 84 = 225
\]

The total number of cookies they have is \(\boxed{225}\)."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \(\boxed{80}\) cm."
"To determine how long it took Chris to mow his lawn by mowing half in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we need to first find the mowing rates for both modes.

1. **Calculate the mowing rate for ""turtle"" mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes) in ""turtle"" mode.
   - Therefore, the mowing rate for ""turtle"" mode is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}
     \]

2. **Calculate the mowing rate for ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes in ""rabbit"" mode.
   - Therefore, the mowing rate for ""rabbit"" mode is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ lawns per minute}
     \]

3. **Determine the time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - Half the lawn is \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the lawn.
   - Using the ""turtle"" mode rate:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}}{\frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Determine the time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - Half the lawn is \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the lawn.
   - Using the ""rabbit"" mode rate:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}}{\frac{1}{40} \text{ lawns per minute}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time taken in ""turtle"" mode and ""rabbit"" mode:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."
"First, we need to determine the total time John and Jack have already spent walking. They spent 6 minutes to get to the library and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. Adding these times together gives:

\[ 6 + 13 = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

John and Jack have a total of 30 minutes to walk to school. To find out how much time they have left, we subtract the time they have already spent walking from the total time they have:

\[ 30 - 19 = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the amount of time John and Jack have left to get to school without being late is:

\[
\boxed{11}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit Catherine buys:

1. **Apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples.
   - The price per kilo of apples is $4.
   - Therefore, the cost for apples is:
     \[
     1 \text{ kilo} \times \$4/\text{kilo} = \$4
     \]

2. **Bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas.
   - The price per kilo of bananas is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost for bananas is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times \$2/\text{kilo} = \$4
     \]

3. **Oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges.
   - The price per kilo of oranges is $3.
   - Therefore, the cost for oranges is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times \$3/\text{kilo} = \$6
     \]

Next, we add up the costs of all the fruits to find the total amount Catherine pays:
\[
\$4 \text{ (apples)} + \$4 \text{ (bananas)} + \$6 \text{ (oranges)} = \$14
\]

Thus, the total amount Catherine pays is:
\[
\boxed{14}

"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda baked. Since Celinda baked twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta baked 30 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

After baking, the pair ate 10 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left to be put in the box is:

\[ \text{Cookies left} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

So, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Therefore, the age of the older triplet would be \( x + 7 \) because one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of each twin is the same. Let's denote the age of each twin as \( y \).

The combined ages of the four individuals (one twin, one triplet, and the other two triplets) is given as 44. So, we can write the equation as:
\[ y + (x + 7) + x + x = 44 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ y + 3x + 7 = 44 \]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ y + 3x = 37 \]
We need to find the value of \( y \). To do this, we need to express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = 37 - 3x \]

Since \( y \) and \( x \) are ages, they must be positive integers. We need to find a value of \( x \) such that \( y \) is a positive integer. Let's test some values for \( x \):

If \( x = 9 \):
\[ y = 37 - 3 \cdot 9 = 37 - 27 = 10 \]
So, the ages are: one twin is 10 years old, the older triplet is 16 years old, and the younger triplet is 9 years old. The combined ages are:
\[ 10 + 16 + 9 + 9 = 44 \]
This satisfies the condition. Therefore, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's convert the total time John has before he has to eat dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend on his homework. He has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. Adding these times together gives:
\[ 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has left for a nap:
\[ 180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of minutes John has to nap is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that the total cost of four candies is part of the $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40. Since Manolo bought five lollipops, the total cost for the lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

The total cost for the lollipops and candies is $3.20, so the cost for the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

The cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong. Since Rong saves 20 coins each month, Neil saves:

\[
20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person has saved after 10 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months in 10 years is:

\[
10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
\]

Now, we calculate the total number of coins Rong has saved in 120 months:

\[
20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins}
\]

Similarly, we calculate the total number of coins Neil has saved in 120 months:

\[
28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins}
\]

Finally, we add the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil to find the combined total:

\[
2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins}
\]

Thus, the total number of coins they have after 10 years is:

\[
\boxed{5760}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.6x \text{ dollars} \]

The total bill \( x \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of one banana. We know that one apple costs $0.50 and one banana costs twice as much as one apple. Therefore, the cost of one banana is:
\[ 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange. We know that one orange costs three times as much as one banana. Therefore, the cost of one orange is:
\[ 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the total cost of the bananas in the crate. Since there are 5 bananas in the crate, the total cost of the bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1.00 = 5.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we find the total cost of the apples in the crate. Since there are 12 apples in the crate, the total cost of the apples is:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we find the total cost of the oranges in the crate. Since there are 7 oranges in the crate, the total cost of the oranges is:
\[ 7 \times 3.00 = 21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the bananas, apples, and oranges to find the total cost of the crate:
\[ 5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \boxed{32.00} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of square in Brittany's quilted comforter.

1. **Red Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Number of red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Number of blue squares} = \text{Number of red squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Number of green squares} = \text{Number of blue squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Number of white squares} = \text{Number of green squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Next, we sum the number of all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[
\text{Total number of squares} = \text{Number of red squares} + \text{Number of blue squares} + \text{Number of green squares} + \text{Number of white squares}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter in square feet is equal to the total number of squares:
\[
\text{Total area} = 68 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. According to the problem, the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[
\text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant:

\[
\text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48
\]

Now, we need to determine the total number of chairs required for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of chairs needed is:

\[
\text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57
\]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:

\[
\text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total current chairs} = 57 - 48 = 9
\]

Thus, Mia needs to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"First, we need to determine the number of bucks among the 50 deer. Since 50 percent of the deer are bucks, we calculate:

\[ 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]

So, there are 25 bucks.

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. We know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]

So, the number of 8 point bucks is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of points each student has collected.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Betty's Points (Recheck):**
   We already calculated Betty's points as 65, so this is consistent.

5. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Next, we sum the points collected by all students to find the total points the class has:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points}
\]
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the number of points the class is missing is:
\[
\text{Points needed} = 400 - 255 = 145
\]

Thus, the class is missing \(\boxed{145}\) points to go on the trip."
"To determine the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion, we need to follow the family tree step by step.

1. **Great Grandma Jones' Children:**
   - Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.

2. **Great Grandma Jones' Grandchildren:**
   - Each of her 3 children has 3 children of their own.
   - Therefore, the total number of grandchildren is:
     \[
     3 \text{ children} \times 3 \text{ grandchildren per child} = 9 \text{ grandchildren}
     \]

3. **Great Grandma Jones' Great-Grandbabies:**
   - Each of her 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own.
   - Therefore, the total number of great-grandbabies is:
     \[
     9 \text{ grandchildren} \times 3 \text{ great-grandbabies per grandchild} = 27 \text{ great-grandbabies}
     \]

Thus, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses to make her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after funding her retirement and paying for her car. We subtract the amounts she spent on retirement and car payment from her total paycheck:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is:

\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many pencils are currently in the box. Since the box has space for 20 pencils but 4 pencils are missing, we subtract the missing pencils from the total capacity:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box. Since one pair consists of 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils by 2:

\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city. The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, the total number of fireworks from the city is:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

Hannah's house is at an angle where she can see 40% of the city's fireworks. Therefore, the number of fireworks Hannah can see from the city is:
\[ 300 \times 0.40 = 120 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. Hannah sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each. So, the total number of fireworks from Hannah's backyard is:

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat holds one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy 20 drinks and 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

The cost of each drink is $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of each snack is $2, so the total cost for the snacks is:
\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the drinks and the snacks together, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the group has spent \(\boxed{160}\) dollars overall on snacks and drinks."
"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Substituting the known values for Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, we get:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Simplifying the left side, we find:

\[ 8800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

To find Gary's truck capacity, we subtract 8800 from 11600:

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 - 8800 = 2800 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of gravel that Gary's truck can carry is:

\[ \boxed{2800} \]"
"To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of dumplings each female ate.
2. Determine the number of dumplings each male ate.
3. Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females.
4. Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males.
5. Sum the dumplings eaten by the females and the males to get the total number of dumplings cooked.

Given:
- Each female ate 3 dumplings.
- Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.
- There are 6 females and 8 males (including Larry).

First, calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females:
\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings per female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Next, calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males:
\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings per male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

Now, sum the dumplings eaten by the females and the males to get the total number of dumplings cooked:
\[ 18 \text{ dumplings} + 32 \text{ dumplings} = 50 \text{ dumplings} \]

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]

Gerald's share, which is 3 parts out of 5, is calculated as:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60 \]

So, Gerald received $60.

Next, we need to find out how much money Gerald has left after spending $10 on a book. We subtract the amount spent from his initial share:
\[ 60 - 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Gerald has left is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second. Therefore, the speed of the turtle can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Speed of the turtle} = \frac{\text{Speed of the cat}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula for distance, which is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the speed of the turtle and the time:

\[
\text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the turtle can crawl \(\boxed{120}\) feet in 40 seconds."
"First, we need to determine how much more money the firefighters need to raise to reach their goal. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. From the information given, in the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. Therefore, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200. Since they raise $700 per hour, the number of additional hours needed is:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is the initial 3 hours plus the additional 6 hours:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the percentage of water used for industrial purposes:**
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
   - 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes.
   - Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes is:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40\% = 32\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes:**
   - The total water used by the city is 40%.
   - The industrial water usage is 32%.
   - Therefore, the non-industrial water usage is:
     \[
     40\% - 32\% = 8\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is \(\boxed{8\%}\)."
"To determine how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days in 2 weeks.
2. Multiply the number of days by the daily rate.

First, we know that one week has 7 days. Therefore, 2 weeks have:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we know that Alex charges $12 per day. So, for 14 days, the total charge is:
\[ 14 \times 12 = 168 \]

Thus, the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring is:
\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then sum the amounts produced in the given time.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for both types of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream:
  \[
  50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
  \]

- For vanilla ice cream:
  \[
  12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Finally, we sum the total production of both types of ice cream:
\[
2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is:
\[
\boxed{3000}

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

1. **Croissants:**
   \[
   5 \text{ croissants} \times \$3.00 \text{ per croissant} = 5 \times 3 = \$15.00
   \]

2. **Cinnamon Rolls:**
   \[
   4 \text{ cinnamon rolls} \times \$2.50 \text{ per cinnamon roll} = 4 \times 2.50 = \$10.00
   \]

3. **Mini Quiches:**
   \[
   3 \text{ mini quiches} \times \$4.00 \text{ per mini quiche} = 3 \times 4 = \$12.00
   \]

4. **Blueberry Muffins:**
   \[
   13 \text{ blueberry muffins} \times \$1.00 \text{ per blueberry muffin} = 13 \times 1 = \$13.00
   \]

Next, we sum up the costs of all the items:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount on his total purchase. To find the discount amount:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times 50 = \$5.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00
\]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"First, let's determine the cost of the deal. For every 2 scoops Erin buys, she gets 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50, so the cost for 2 scoops is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

This means for every $3.00 Erin spends, she gets 3 scoops of ice cream (2 scoops she pays for and 1 scoop is free).

Erin has $6.00. To find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can get, we divide her total money by the cost of the deal:
\[ 6.00 \div 3.00 = 2 \]

This means Erin can get 2 sets of the deal, which is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

So, the total number of scoops Erin should buy is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy eat in two weeks.

Two weeks consist of 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Initially, both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, the amount of candy each has left is:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Ginger} \]
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Amy} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount of candy Amy has:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after two weeks, Amy has \(\boxed{14}\) more pieces of candy than Ginger."
"First, we need to determine the area that Mr. Boarden wants to cover. He wants to cover two thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom. We calculate this as follows:

\[
\text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft}
\]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 square feet, the number of tiles required is:

\[
\text{Number of tiles} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{576}

"To determine how much James saved by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store.

First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries:
- The initial cost to go picking is $20.
- The cost per pound is $1.5.
- James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.

The cost for the blueberries themselves is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the initial cost to go picking:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries at the store:
- The cost per pound at the store is $2.5.

The total cost at the store is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, we find the difference between the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and the cost of picking them:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

Therefore, James saved:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"First, let's determine the original price of each computer. The company had planned to spend $700 on each computer. 

The new price of each computer is 10% higher than the original price. To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:

\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Next, we need to find the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 500 \times 770 = 385000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

\[ \boxed{385000} \]"
"To determine the total number of calories in John's omelet, we need to calculate the calories from each component and then sum them up.

1. **Eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg contains 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs: \( 6 \times 75 = 450 \) calories.

2. **Cheese:**
   - John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Cheese contains 120 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from cheese: \( 2 \times 120 = 240 \) calories.

3. **Ham:**
   - John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz.
   - Ham contains 40 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from ham: \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \) calories.

Now, we sum the calories from all components:
\[ 450 \text{ (eggs)} + 240 \text{ (cheese)} + 80 \text{ (ham)} = 770 \text{ calories} \]

"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for each minute separately based on whether her arms are raised or not.

First, let's calculate the taps per minute when her arms are not raised. When her arms are not raised, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. Therefore, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are not raised is:
\[ 300 + 250 = 550 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Next, let's calculate the taps per minute when her arms are raised. When her arms are raised, she taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute. Therefore, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are raised is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised for 2 minutes and not raised for the remaining 3 minutes. Therefore, the total number of taps when her arms are not raised is:
\[ 550 \text{ taps per minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps} \]

The total number of taps when her arms are raised is:
\[ 400 \text{ taps per minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total number of taps:
\[ 1650 + 800 = 2450 \]

Thus, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:
\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to compare the total cost of having the city fix it versus the cost of Ron fixing it himself.

1. **Cost if the city fixes the pothole:**
   - The city does not charge Ron for fixing the pothole if they do it.

2. **Cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself:**
   - Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
   - Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars

3. **Total cost for Ron to fix the pothole:**

   \]

5. **Net savings by fixing the pothole:**
   \[
   450 - 195 = 255 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Ron saves \(\boxed{255}\) dollars by fixing the pothole."
"To determine the number of chairs left in the restaurant, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of normal chairs left after some were sent for repair.
2. Calculate the number of baby chairs left after some were sent for repair.
3. Add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to get the total number of chairs left.

First, let's find out how many normal chairs are left:
- Initially, there are 170 normal chairs.
- 20 normal chairs were sent for repair.
- Therefore, the number of normal chairs left is \(170 - 20 = 150\).

Next, let's find out how many baby chairs are left:
- Initially, there are 23 baby chairs.
- 13 baby chairs were sent for repair.
- Therefore, the number of baby chairs left is \(23 - 13 = 10\).

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to get the total number of chairs left:
- The total number of chairs left is \(150 + 10 = 160\).

So, the number of chairs the restaurant has left is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:
\[ 5 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
Since three people ate 8 slices each, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the other two friends. Each of these two people ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
Since two people ate 9 slices each, the total number of slices eaten by the other two friends is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages, and the dog can eat the same number of sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Therefore, the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages is:

\[
30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the time it takes for the cat and the time it takes for the dog, and then dividing by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches, we get:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars separately, and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these 16 cars is:
\[
16 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these 24 cars is:
\[
24 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars:
\[
64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[
\boxed{112}
\]"

1. Calculate the total number of spools:
   \[
   15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} + 40 \text{ (light green)} + 50 \text{ (dark green)} = 150 \text{ spools}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of blue spools:
   \[
   15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} = 60 \text{ blue spools}
   \]

3. Determine the percentage of blue spools:
   \[
   \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
   \]

So, the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000

2. **People who voted by midday (12:00)**:
   - By midday, \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by midday = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000\)

3. **Remaining people after midday**:
   - Remaining people = Total people - People who voted by midday
   - Remaining people = \(5000 - 2000 = 3000\)

4. **People who voted by 16:00**:
   - By 16:00, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00 = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000\)

5. **Remaining people who had not voted by 16:00**:
   - Remaining people = Remaining people after midday - People who voted by 16:00
   - Remaining people = \(3000 - 2000 = 1000\)

"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the number of pieces per pack.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days. Since Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of gum are required. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces needed by the number of pieces per pack:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need \(\boxed{8}\) packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed.

- **Number of kids and smores per kid:**
  \[
  9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores}
  \]

- **Number of adults and smores per adult:**
  \[
  6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores}
  \]

- **Total number of smores needed:**
  \[
  18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores}
  \]

Next, we need to determine how many sleeves of graham crackers are required to make 24 smores. Each sleeve makes 8 smores.

- **Number of sleeves needed:**
  \[
  \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves}
  \]

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, the number of boxes needed is:

"First, let's determine how many votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we calculate:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{50% of candidate A's votes} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

So, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

   - Total water used for giant cubes: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) ounces.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \( 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \) ounces.

Next, we sum the total water used for all the ice cubes:
\[ 12 \text{ ounces (giant cubes)} + 14 \text{ ounces (medium cubes)} + 4 \text{ ounces (small cubes)} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:

"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students in each class:**
   Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of girls in each class:**
   We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, we calculate 40% of 40:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of boys in each class:**
   Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the number of boys is:

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during one 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- Therefore, in one 4-week month, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.

During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day. So, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month is:
\[ 20 \times 60 = 1200 \text{ chairs} \]

During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. So, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month is:
\[ 8 \times 100 = 800 \text{ chairs} \]

Adding these together, the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is:
\[ 1200 + 800 = 2000 \text{ chairs} \]

Since we need to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we multiply the number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:

\]

Next, we need to find out how much each person will pay in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, each person's annual share is:

\[
20 \times 12 = 240
\]

So, each roommate will pay \(\boxed{240}\) dollars per year for electricity."
"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent for the event.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. Since one dozen equals 12, we can calculate the total number of glasses and plates as follows:

\[
8 \text{ dozen glasses} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
\]
\[
4 \text{ dozen plates} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers is \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers are worth 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of a large button, so 27 small buttons are worth \(\frac{27}{3} = 9\) large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers and \(40 + 9 = 49\) large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 49 large stickers is \(0.5 \times 49 = 24.5\). Since the number of stickers must be an integer, we assume she trades 24 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 24 large stickers are worth 24 large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(49 - 24 = 25\) large stickers and \(49 + 24 = 73\) large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 25 large stickers left, and each large sticker is worth three small stickers, so 25 large stickers are worth \(25 \times 3 = 75\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 75 small stickers are worth 75 small buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(3 + 75 = 78\) small buttons and 73 large buttons.

5. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - The total number of buttons Lorraine has is the sum of the large buttons and the small buttons.
   - Therefore, the total number of buttons is \(73 + 78 = 151\).

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{151}\)."

2. On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
3. On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we sum the matches played on each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is given as 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} \]
\[ x = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order.

1. **Extra-Small (XS) Shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.
   \[
   \text{XS} = 11
   \]

2. **Small (S) Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   \[
   \text{S} = 2 \times \text{XS} = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

3. **Medium (M) Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   \[
   \text{M} = \text{S} - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18
   \]

4. **Large (L) Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   \[
   \text{L} = \frac{\text{M}}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]

5. **Extra-Large (XL) Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   \[
   \text{XL} = \text{L} + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15
   \]

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed:
\[
\text{Total} = \text{XS} + \text{S} + \text{M} + \text{L} + \text{XL} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15
\]

Calculating the total:
\[
11 + 22 = 33
\]
\[
33 + 18 = 51
\]
\[
51 + 9 = 60
\]
\[
60 + 15 = 75

"First, let's determine how many people think horse #2 will win the race. Given that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win. The total number of people is 50, so the remaining people are:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Of these remaining 40 people, 60% think horse #7 will win. We calculate this as follows:

\[ 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people this is, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of Jana's puppies as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian puppies is:
\[
\frac{2}{3}P
\]

Next, we know that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = \frac{2}{9}P
\]

We are given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{9}P = 6
\]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by isolating \( P \):
\[
P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27

"First, let's determine how much money Ava gave to Jayden. Ava has $90 and she gave Jayden half of it. Therefore, the amount of money Ava gave to Jayden is:

\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Next, we add the money Jayden originally had to the money Ava gave him to find out how much money Jayden has in total:

\[
70 + 45 = 115
\]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more money Jayden needs to buy the camera, we subtract the total amount of money Jayden has from the cost of the camera:

\[
200 - 115 = 85
\]

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second house).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first house).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so we calculate:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Thus, the third house will need \(\boxed{100}\) cases of shingles."

"First, let's determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Ezra read 300 books, so we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Ahmed read:

\[ \text{Number of books Ahmed read} = \frac{\text{Number of books Ezra read}}{2} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Next, we need to find out how many books Ezra will have read after deciding to read 150 more books. Initially, Ezra read 300 books and then read 150 more, so the total number of books Ezra has read is:

\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we add the number of books Ahmed read to the number of books Ezra has read to find the total number of books they have read altogether:

\[ 150 + 450 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total number of books they have read altogether is:

\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"First, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday. On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings from teaching hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]
Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5:
\[ 75 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]
So, her total earnings for Monday are $80.

Next, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Wednesday. On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings from teaching hours are:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]
Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, we add her earnings from both days to find her total earnings for the two days:

"First, let's calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold. Since they sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents, the total number of vanilla scents sold is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruity scents sold. Since they sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, the total number of fruity scents sold is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents. We do this by subtracting the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the number of vanilla scents sold more than the fruity scents is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, we calculate the total amount of money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants at $3 each:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

So, Bennet makes $60 from the eggplants. He wants to make a total of $135. Therefore, the amount of money he still needs to make from selling the ears of corn is:

\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount of money he needs by the number of ears of corn:

\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has available over the weekend:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that she spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time is:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Tatiana plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining 9 hours:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can determine the time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on reading and video games from the remaining time:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of her weekend that she spends playing soccer, we use the total time available (12 hours) and the time spent playing soccer (3 hours):

\[ \left( \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer is:

\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"

\]

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon. This means the number of pencils remaining with Anthony is:

\[
50 - 25 = 25
\]

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie. We calculate 3/5 of 25:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
\]

So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie. This means the number of pencils remaining with Anthony is:

\[
25 - 15 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of pencils Anthony kept is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of movies**: Mike has 600 movies.

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series.
   \[
   \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200
   \]

3. **Cost of series movies**: Each series movie costs $6.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
   \]

4. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the series movies from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
   \]

5. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   \[
   \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160
   \]

6. **Cost of older movies**: Each older movie costs $5.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800
   \]

7. **Normal movies**: The rest of the remaining movies are normal movies.
   \[
   \text{Number of normal movies} = 400 - 160 = 240

"To determine how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit separately and then sum these costs.

1. **Peaches:**
   - Price per pound: $2.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for peaches: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00 \)

2. **Plums:**
   - Price per pound: $1.00
   - Pounds picked: 8

"To determine the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance traveled by car and the distance hiked, then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by car. The family drove for a certain number of hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. We need to find out how many hours they drove. The total travel time is 6 hours, and they hiked for 1.5 hours. Therefore, the time spent driving is:
\[ 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

The distance traveled by car is:
\[ \text{Distance by car} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance hiked. The average hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed. Half the driving speed is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour} \]
So, the hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The distance hiked is:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance traveled by car and the distance hiked:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance to the vacation spot is:

"Let's define the variables for the number of enemies jumped on, berries collected, and seconds left on the timer for both Ava and Emma.

Let:
- \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( E_t \) be the seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

Then, for Ava:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \) (Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma).
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \) (Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma).
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \) (Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma).

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{seconds left on the timer} \)

For Emma:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times E_e \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times E_b \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times E_t \)

For Ava:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times (E_e + 8) = 10E_e + 80 \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times (E_b + 3) = 5E_b + 15 \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times (E_t + 4) = 30E_t + 120 \)

The total score for Emma is:
\[ 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

The total score for Ava is:
\[ 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

The difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is:
\[ (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) = 215 \]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is:

Thus, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
Rearranging terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \), we get:
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]
We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:
\[ O + W = 17 \]
Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]
Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
Isolate \( W \):
\[ 17 - 5 = 3W \]
\[ 12 = 3W \]
\[ W = 4 \]
Now substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):
\[ O = 17 - 4 \]
\[ O = 13 \]
So, Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

Therefore, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie was given:
- Ten twenties, which is \(10 \times 20 = 200\) dollars.
- Fourteen quarters, which is \(14 \times 0.25 = 3.50\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money she received is:
\[200 + 3.50 = 203.50 \text{ dollars}\]

Next, we need to determine how much money she spent. She spent all the quarters and \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties.

The amount spent on quarters is:
\[14 \times 0.25 = 3.50 \text{ dollars}\]

The amount spent on twenties is:
\[\frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars}\]

- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is:

\[
\boxed{142}

"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we start by calculating the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

First, we know that one-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs. Given that the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of smart TVs sold is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, we know that one-eighth of the total sales are analog TVs. Therefore, the number of analog TVs sold is:
\[
\frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

The rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs. To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
\[
40 - 10 - 5 = 25
\]

Thus, the number of OLED TVs sold is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the trip.
2. Determine how much the school will contribute.
3. Calculate how much John needs to raise on his own.
4. Determine how much more John needs to raise after accounting for the school's contribution.

First, the total cost of the trip is $300. The school will cover half of this cost:
\[
\text{School's contribution} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
\]
This means John needs to cover the other half of the cost:
\[
\text{John's contribution} = 300 - 150 = 150
\]
John currently has $50. Therefore, the amount of money John still needs to raise is:
\[
\text{Amount John needs} = 150 - 50 = 100
\]
So, the amount of money John is missing is:
\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the temperature during the night. If it is 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:
\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Therefore, the temperature needs to be raised from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. The difference in temperature is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees is:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Thus, the number of logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. This is calculated by dividing the total number of people by the size of each group:

\[
\frac{90}{9} = 10
\]

So, there are 10 groups.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups each brought back 2 seashells. According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups brought back seashells. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]

So, 6 groups each brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells brought back, we multiply the number of groups that brought seashells by the number of seashells each group brought:

\[
6 \times 2 = 12
\]

Thus, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Let's start with the initial number of people on the train, which is 172.

1. At the first stop, 47 people get off the train:
   \[
   172 - 47 = 125
   \]
   So, there are 125 people left on the train.

2. At the same stop, 13 more people get on the train:
   \[
   125 + 13 = 138
   \]
   So, there are now 138 people on the train.

3. At the next stop, 38 people get off the train:
   \[
   138 - 38 = 100
   \]
   So, there are now 100 people on the train.

The final number of people on the train is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month.
2. Determine the total value of these bottle caps.

First, we know that Damien finds 10 bottle caps each day. Therefore, in a 30-day month, the total number of bottle caps he finds is:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps} \]

Next, we know that each bottle cap is worth $0.25. Therefore, the total value of 300 bottle caps is:
\[ 300 \text{ bottle caps} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/bottle cap} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, we need to determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and her special hourly rate for additional hours. Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. The special hourly rate for additional hours is 150% of her regular hourly rate. We calculate the special hourly rate as follows:

\[
\text{Special hourly rate} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many of the 11 hours Jamie worked were regular hours and how many were additional hours. Since she works 8 regular hours each day, the number of additional hours she worked is:

\[
11 - 8 = 3 \text{ additional hours}
\]

Now, we calculate the total pay for the regular hours and the additional hours separately and then sum them up. The pay for the regular hours is:

\[
8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

The pay for the additional hours is:

\[
3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total pay for the day:

\[
160 + 90 = 250 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount Jamie was paid for her work that day is:

\[
\boxed{250}
\]"
"The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. There are half as many male lions as female lions, which means there are \(12 \div 2 = 6\) male lions. Additionally, there are 14 lion cubs. To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, add the number of female lions, male lions, and cubs together:

\[12 + 6 + 14 = 32\]

So, there are 32 lions in the enclosure."
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised at 25% off.

To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40:
\[
0.25 \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[
40 - 10 = 30
\]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price of the jeans from the amount he paid:
\[
50 - 30 = 20
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Mike will have left over is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.
2. Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
3. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
4. Determine the total salary paid over three months.

**Step 1: Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.**

The initial number of employees is 200. After hiring 60 new employees, the total number of employees is:
\[ 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.**

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary for 260 employees is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Determine the total salary paid over three months.**

The total salary paid over three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ \boxed{3120000} \]"
"To determine the total time Carrie's choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the time for each song and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total time for singing ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and they will sing it twice.
- Therefore, the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is:
  \[
  150 \text{ seconds/song} \times 2 \text{ songs} = 300 \text{ seconds}
  \]

Next, we calculate the time for singing ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and they will sing it once.
- Therefore, the total time for ""Jingle Bells"" is:
  \[
  240 \text{ seconds}
  \]

Now, we sum the times for both songs to find the total caroling time:
\[
300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time they will be caroling is:

"First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at different points in time:

1. **Billy's starting hourly wage:**
   \[
   \text{Starting wage} = \$10 \text{ per hour}
   \]

2. **After 2 months, Billy's wage is increased by $0.50 per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Wage after 2 months} = \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
   \]

3. **On his first anniversary, Billy's wage is increased by $1.00 per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Wage on first anniversary} = \$10.50 + \$1.00 = \$11.50 \text{ per hour}
   \]

Next, let's determine Sally's starting hourly wage:
\[
\text{Sally's starting wage} = \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
\]

Now, we calculate the earnings for both Billy and Sally over 20 hours of work:

1. **Billy's earnings:**
   \[
   \text{Billy's earnings} = 20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50 \text{ per hour} = 20 \times 11.50 = \$230
   \]

2. **Sally's earnings:**
   \[
   \text{Sally's earnings} = 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = 20 \times 10.50 = \$210

To find half of Pierson's points:
\[
\frac{278}{2} = 139
\]

Next, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's points:
\[
139 + 11 = 150
\]

Now, we need to find the total points scored by both Pierson and Nikita. We add Pierson's points to Nikita's points:
\[
278 + 150 = 428
\]

Thus, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[
\boxed{428}

"To determine the total number of trees planted at the end of the reforestation campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- Each class has 25 students.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(25 \times 40 = 1000\).
- Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is 1000.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \(3 \times 40 = 120\).
- Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is \(120 \times 2 = 240\).

Now, we sum the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers:

"First, let's determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Adding these together gives:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy \(\boxed{6}\) stuffed goats."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks (14 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the first 2 weeks} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours she plays in the second part of her schedule. She plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week (7 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the second week} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we add the hours from both parts of her schedule to find the total hours she has played so far.

\[ \text{Total hours played} = 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours.

\[ \text{Hours still needed} = 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the first car:**
   - The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the second car:**
   - The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Determine the separation between the two cars:**
   - The second car is ahead of the first car by the difference in the distances they have traveled:
     \[
     \text{Separation} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
     \]

Thus, the number of miles that will separate the two cars after 2 hours is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials before the premium is added. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. Adding these together gives:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original total cost of the materials to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final amount James paid is:

"To determine the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then find the ratio of these two numbers.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- For the third graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- For the fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- For the fifth graders: the pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders. The fourth graders' pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \), so the fifth graders' pass rate is \( 2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \). Therefore, the number of fifth graders who passed is \( 0.8 \times 400 = 320 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed:
\[ 340 \text{ (third graders)} + 40 \text{ (fourth graders)} + 320 \text{ (fifth graders)} = 680 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of students who took the test:
\[ 500 \text{ (third graders)} + 100 \text{ (fourth graders)} + 400 \text{ (fifth graders)} = 1000 \]

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students who took the test:
\[ \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68 \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.68 \times 100 = 68\% \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is:
\[ \boxed{68\%} \]"
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

   72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips}
   \]

2. **Determine how many glass chips are needed per square inch:**
   - It takes 12 glass chips to make 1 square inch.

3. **Calculate the total area Milo can cover with the glass chips:**
   \[
   \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}
   \]

4. **Determine the dimensions of the mosaic:**
   - The mosaic is 3 inches tall.
   - Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches.
   - The area of the mosaic is given by:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Dale initially planned to sell 100 butterscotch candies but ended up selling 150. After selling these 150 candies, he ordered 100 more. 

First, we calculate the total number of candies Dale has after his second order:
\[ 150 \text{ (sold)} + 100 \text{ (ordered)} = 250 \text{ candies} \]

Since Dale initially only had 100 candies and then sold 150, he sold more than he initially had, but he then ordered 100 more. Therefore, the number of candies he still needs to sell is the total number of candies he has minus the number he has already sold:
\[ 250 \text{ (total candies)} - 150 \text{ (sold)} = 100 \]

So, the number of candies Dale still needs to sell is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine the number of additional students that join by the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the beginning of the year.

1. ** Beginning of the year (January 1):**
   \[
   \text{Number of students} = 10
   \]

2. ** End of January:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students} = 10 \times 2 = 20
   \]

3. ** End of February:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students} = 20 \times 2 = 40
   \]

4. ** End of March:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students} = 40 \times 2 = 80
   \]

5. ** End of April:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students} = 80 \times 2 = 160
   \]

6. ** End of May:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students} = 160 \times 2 = 320
   \]

Now, we need to find the additional number of students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students at the beginning of the year.

\[
\text{Additional students} = \text{Number of students at the end of May} - \text{Number of students at the beginning of the year}
\]
\[
\text{Additional students} = 320 - 10 = 310
\]

Thus, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is \(\boxed{310}\)."
"To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of branches climbed during the week:**
   - Felix charges $0.25 per branch.
   - He made $105 during the week.
   - Therefore, the total number of branches climbed is:
     \[
     \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
     \]

2. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{105}{0.25} = 105 \div 0.25 = 105 \times 4 = 420
   \]
   So, Felix climbed 420 branches during the week.

3. **Calculate the average number of branches climbed per day:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the average number of branches climbed per day is:
     \[
     \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7}
     \]

4. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{420}{7} = 60
   \]

Thus, Felix climbed an average of \(\boxed{60}\) branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

1. **First batch of flowers:**
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. **Second batch of flowers:**
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. **Third batch of flowers:**
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. **Fourth batch of flowers:**
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Next, we sum these totals to find the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Rose drops 1 flower from each batch. We need to calculate the number of petals on these dropped flowers:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Summing the petals of the dropped flowers:
\[ 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

Subtract the petals of the dropped flowers from the total number of petals:
\[ 101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals} \]

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's break down the time each person can play with one quarter:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes.
2. Two of Jack's friends can play for half as long as Jack, so each of them can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The other friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so this friend can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.

Next, we calculate the total number of quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):

1. Jack: \(\frac{240}{20} = 12\) quarters.
2. Each of the two friends who can play for 10 minutes: \(\frac{240}{10} = 24\) quarters each.
3. The friend who can play for 30 minutes: \(\frac{240}{30} = 8\) quarters.

Now, we sum up the total number of quarters used:

\[
12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68
\]

So, the total amount of money used is \(\boxed{68}\) quarters."
"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil in ounces.
- According to the problem, the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so \( o = 2s \).
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express all the quantities in terms of \( z \):
- \( s = 2z \)
- \( o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \)

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of the amounts of salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar:
\[ s + o + z + z + s = 10 \]
Substituting the expressions in terms of \( z \):
\[ 2z + 4z + z + z + 2z = 10 \]
Combining like terms:
\[ 10z = 10 \]
Solving for \( z \):
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{4}\) ounces."
"John buys 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each. 

The total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

The total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

**Final Answer: 4500**"
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes he currently has and subtract that from the total number needed.

First, we add the cupcakes he already has:
\[ 8 \text{ (chocolate)} + 40 \text{ (toffee)} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes needed:
\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

So, Paul should buy \(\boxed{15}\) more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. According to the problem, Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. The number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. Initially, Joe had 40 cars. After selling 8 cars and giving away 16 cars, the number of cars he remains with is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money came from the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they collectively raised $125,000. So, the amount raised by each student is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked each day and then sum these times.

First, we know that on the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. We need to convert this time into minutes:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that on the second day, Sandy walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]
We convert this time into minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time she walked on both days to find the total time:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes} + 240 \text{ minutes} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:

   \]
3. During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. The number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35
   \]
4. The number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35
   \]

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much John makes in a single cycle of work. Each cycle consists of 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. Therefore, the payment for one cycle is:

\[ 5 \text{ tasks} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how much John makes in a single day. Since he does 30 cycles of work each day, the daily earnings are:

\[ 30 \text{ cycles} \times \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} = \$180.00 \]

Finally, to find out how much he makes in a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:

\[ 7 \text{ days} \times \$180.00 \text{ per day} = \$1260.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1260}

"First, we calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. Since she bought 8 packages of cat food and each package contains 11 tins, the total number of tins of cat food is:
\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. Since she bought 6 packages of dog food and each package contains 6 tins, the total number of tins of dog food is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:
\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

Therefore, Kimberly bought \(\boxed{52}\) more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards. The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we isolate \( P \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Then, we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick has:

\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And we can find out how many cards Becca has:

\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, the number of cards Becca has is:

\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many eggs Cindy had in total.

1. **Green Eggs:**
   Cindy had 5 green eggs.

2. **Blue Eggs:**
   Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green ones. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Pink Eggs:**
   Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is:
   \[

"First, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount.

\[ \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \]

Next, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles.

\[ \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \]
\[ \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \]
\[ \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose by subtracting the refund from the total cost of the book and the shipping cost.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 32 + 3.00 = 35.00 \]
\[ \text{Money lost} = 35.00 - 24.00 = 11.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Milly will lose is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Mulan initially has $40. Her father gave her an additional $100. So, the total amount of money she has before her purchases is:

"To determine how much chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the production for each of the first three weeks and then use the total monthly production to find the fourth week's production.

1. **First Week Production:**
   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

2. **Second Week Production:**
   Boris produces half as much as the first week. Therefore, the production for the second week is:
   \[
   \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week Production:**
   Boris produces three times as much as the first week. Therefore, the production for the third week is:
   \[
   3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   Adding the production from the first three weeks:
   \[
   8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Fourth Week Production:**
   The total monthly production is 50,000 bars. Therefore, the production for the fourth week is:
   \[
   50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the production for the fourth week is \(\boxed{14000}\)."

1. The base installation cost includes:
   - Hanging 4 mirrors
   - 2 shelves
   - 1 chandelier
   - 10 pictures

2. The base installation cost is $129.00.

3. Additional items cost $15.00 per item.

Now, let's calculate the additional items that Angela needs installed:

- Angela needs 6 mirrors, but the base installation already includes 4 mirrors. Therefore, she needs an additional 2 mirrors.
- Angela needs 2 chandeliers, but the base installation already includes 1 chandelier. Therefore, she needs an additional 1 chandelier.
- Angela needs 20 pictures, but the base installation already includes 10 pictures. Therefore, she needs an additional 10 pictures.

Next, we calculate the cost for the additional items:

- Cost for 2 additional mirrors: \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars
- Cost for 1 additional chandelier: \(1 \times 15 = 15\) dollars
- Cost for 10 additional pictures: \(10 \times 15 = 150\) dollars

Now, we add the cost of the additional items to the base installation cost:

\[ 129 + 30 + 15 + 150 = 324 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Angela to have all her items installed is:

\[
\boxed{324}

   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**

"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each segment of his journey and then sum these distances.

First, we calculate the distance traveled during the first part of his journey:
- Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour.
- He travels for 4 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles.

Next, we calculate the distance traveled during the second part of his journey:
- Mason's speed is still 8 miles per hour.
- He travels for 6 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles.

Now, we sum the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance traveled:
- Total distance = Distance from first part + Distance from second part = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

Therefore, the total distance Mason has traveled is \(\boxed{80}\) miles."
"To determine how long it will take four turtles to travel across the highway, we need to first find the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find the speed of the turtles.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) and the speed of each kangaroo be \( v \).
   - Since three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \( D \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to cross the highway:**
   - The time \( t \) it takes for the turtles to cross the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     t = \frac{D}{\text{speed of one turtle}} = \frac{54v}{\frac{v}{2}} = 54v \times \frac{2}{v} = 108 \text{ hours}

Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway is \(\boxed{108}\) hours."
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we start by defining the number of dishes each person makes based on the information given.

1. **Kora's Dishes:**
   Kora made 20 dishes.

2. **Rory's Dishes:**
   Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Rory's dishes} = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Jada's Dishes:**
   Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Jada's dishes} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

4. **Total Dishes:**
   To find the total number of dishes made by all three, we sum the dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:

"First, let's determine the reduced price of the laptop after the trade-in. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. Therefore, the reduced price is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Erika has received money from various sources:
- $150 from her part-time job
- $80 from her mom

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money she has is the sum of the money in her purse, the money from her job, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"

- From 3 large apples, each sliced into 5 pieces, Adam gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, each sliced into 3 pieces, Adam gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Adding these together, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces with his 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, with 3 cows, the total milk production is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk he needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the desired production:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many more cows are required to produce the additional 10 liters of milk:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig starts with. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he starts with:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:

   - Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.
   - Since Jack has 30 socks, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.

3. **Determine the number of dishes Peter has:**
   - Peter has half as many dishes as Jack.
   - Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

4. **Calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:**
   - Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes.
   - Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes.
   - The total number of socks is \( 30 + 60 = 90 \).
   - The total number of dishes is \( 60 + 30 = 90 \).
   - Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{180}

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the given information and break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of students in the class**: 20
2. **Students good at math only**: 5
3. **Students good at English only**: 8
4. **Students good at both math and English**: Let's denote this number as \( x \).

The total number of students can be expressed as the sum of students good at math only, students good at English only, and students good at both math and English. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 5 + 8 + x = 20 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 13 + x = 20 \]
\[ x = 20 - 13 \]
\[ x = 7 \]

So, there are 7 students who are good at both math and English.

Next, we need to find the total number of students who are good at math. This includes students who are good at math only and students who are good at both math and English:
\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage. This is given by:

\[ 2 \text{ minutes} + 6 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission time, which is 10 minutes. The total time for one group plus the intermission is:

\[ 10 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert duration is 2 hours, which is equivalent to:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many groups can perform in the concert, we divide the total concert time by the time required for one group plus the intermission:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/group}} = 6 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**
   \[
   P = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the annual interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original amount per year. Therefore, the annual interest rate is:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total interest over 3 years:**
   Since the interest is simple, it is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = P \times r \times t
   \]
   where \( t \) is the time in years. Here, \( t = 3 \):
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   300 \times 225 = 67500
   \]
   \[
   67500 \times 3 = 202500
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount after 3 years:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 202500 = 202800
   \]

Thus, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[
\boxed{202800}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of white shirts with collars and the number of white shirts without collars. Since half of the 40 white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is:
\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]
Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is:
\[
40 - 20 = 20
\]

Next, we know that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons. Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons is:
\[
50 - 20 = 30
\]

We need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars. The number of white shirts with no collars is 20, and the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30. The difference is:
\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer will use to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the farmer will earn \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs of shoes to find the average cost per pair.

First, we know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs of shoes:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, the average cost per pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"First, calculate the total cost for the baskets of green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.

\[
3 \times 25 = 75
\]

Next, calculate the total cost for the baskets of red food with the discount:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- You get $2 off for each basket of red food.

First, find the total cost without the discount:
\[
3 \times 18 = 54
\]

Then, apply the $2 discount for each of the 3 baskets:
\[
3 \times 2 = 6
\]

Subtract the total discount from the total cost without the discount:
\[
54 - 6 = 48
\]

Finally, add the total cost of the green food and the discounted red food:
\[
75 + 48 = 123
\]

The total amount you will have to pay is:
\[
\boxed{123}
\]"
"To determine how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms that constitute one-half of the motel.
2. Determine the total time required to clean these rooms.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

First, we find one-half of the 90 rooms:
\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time required to clean 45 rooms, given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room:
\[
45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:
\[
\frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, it would take \(\boxed{15}\) hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Year:**
   - The town will build 12 homes.

2. **Second Year:**
   - They will build three times the number of homes built in the first year.
   - Number of homes in the second year = \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Third Year:**
   - They will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and then double that amount.
   - Total homes built in the first two years = \( 12 + 36 = 48 \).
   - Number of homes in the third year = \( 2 \times 48 = 96 \).

4. **Total Homes Built Over Three Years:**
   - Sum of homes built in each year = \( 12 + 36 + 96 \).

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[
12 + 36 + 96 = 144
\]

So, the total number of homes the town will have built over the next three years is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals involved:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person in question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( S = A - 2 \).
3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( A + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, substitute the expressions for \( A \), \( S \), and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87. \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87, \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87. \]

Add 9 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6B = 96. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 16. \]

Now, substitute \( B = 16 \) back into the expression for \( A \):
\[ A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13. \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for the class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate the total number of glue sticks as follows:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. The glue sticks come in packs of 8, so we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure he has enough glue sticks for all the students and has some extra left over.

Therefore, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the total amount of water passing through the river at the specified point, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After Heavy Rain:**
   After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. Therefore, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Increase on the Third Day:**
   On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:
\[
\boxed{14000}

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and then sum them up.

1. **Day 0 (Initial Infection):**
   - Initially, 10 people are infected.

2. **Day 1:**
   - Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
   - Number of new infections on Day 1: \(10 \times 6 = 60\).
   - Total infected after Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\).

3. **Day 2:**
   - Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
   - Number of new infections on Day 2: \(70 \times 6 = 420\).
   - Total infected after Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\).

4. **Day 3:**
   - Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
   - Number of new infections on Day 3: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\).
   - Total infected after Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, the total number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, we calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[
40 \times 20 = 800
\]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[
0.10 \times 800 = 80
\]

Subtracting this amount from Rafaela's total gives Julieta's total tips:

\[
800 - 80 = 720
\]

Now, we add the tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta to find the total amount of tips they received together:

\[
800 + 720 = 1520
\]

Thus, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

\[
\boxed{1520}

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month. Therefore, in a year (which has 12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge. Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Thus, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a year."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the number of banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, the total number of loaves is:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of green cars:**
   - The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars.
   - Number of red cars = 12.
   - Therefore, the number of green cars = \(12 - 2 = 10\).

2. **Determine the number of blue cars:**
   - The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars.
   - Number of green cars = 10.

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne: \( S = A + 25 \).
2. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn: \( A = F - 12 \).
3. Together, they have 85 books: \( S + A + F = 85 \).

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13. \]

Now we have \( S = F + 13 \) and \( A = F - 12 \). Substitute these into the third equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85, \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85. \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84. \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28. \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

   \]
   So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

2. **Calculate the number of pieces remaining after the first day:**
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36
   \]
   So, 36 pieces remain after the first day.

3. **Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the second day:**
   Tobias ate 10 pieces on the second day.
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26
   \]
   So, 26 pieces remain after the second day.

4. **Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the third day:**

"First, we start with the number of marbles Paul initially has, which is 52. His friend gave him 28 more marbles. So, we add these together:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul lost \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had after receiving more from his friend:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Paul has left is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"First, let's calculate the points Amy scores from the multiple-choice questions. There are 10 multiple-choice questions, each worth 1 point, and Amy answers 80% of them correctly.

The number of multiple-choice questions she answers correctly is:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8 \]

Since each correct multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, the points from the multiple-choice questions are:
\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \]

Next, let's calculate the points Amy scores from the true/false questions. There are 20 true/false questions, each worth 1 point, and Amy answers 90% of them correctly.

The number of true/false questions she answers correctly is:
\[ 20 \times 0.90 = 18 \]

Since each correct true/false question is worth 1 point, the points from the true/false questions are:
\[ 18 \times 1 = 18 \]

Now, let's calculate the points Amy scores from the long-answer questions. There are 5 long-answer questions, each worth 5 points, and Amy answers 60% of them correctly.

The number of long-answer questions she answers correctly is:
\[ 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \]

Since each correct long-answer question is worth 5 points, the points from the long-answer questions are:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Finally, we add up all the points from the multiple-choice, true/false, and long-answer questions:
\[ 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \]

So, the total number of points Amy scores is:
\[ \boxed{41} \]"
"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the total cost of the chickens.

First, calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling these chickens:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000, so the total cost of the chickens he bought is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, the amount Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[ \boxed{7000} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah and Mitchell sold in total. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sales were 32 glasses, the boys together sold:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \text{ glasses} \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2:

\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \text{ glasses each} \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold \(\boxed{5}\) more glasses than Micah."
"First, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Hair Treatment Cost:**
   Iris spent $400 on her hair treatment.

2. **Manicure Cost:**
   The cost of the manicure is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the hair treatment cost.
   \[
   \text{Manicure Cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]

3. **Pedicure Cost:**
   The cost of the pedicure is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the manicure cost.
   \[
   \text{Pedicure Cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

4. **Total Cost:**
   To find the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa, we add the costs of the hair treatment, manicure, and pedicure.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is \(\boxed{575}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will earn from selling the 20 meters of rope at $2 per meter.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, let's assume Sarah uses all the money from the sale to buy a new rope. The cost of the new rope is $1.5 per meter. To find out how much money she will have left over, we need to know the length of the new rope she plans to buy. However, the problem does not specify the length of the new rope. For the sake of this problem, let's assume she buys a rope of the same length as the one she sold, which is 20 meters.

\[ \text{Cost of new rope} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we can find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope.

\[ \text{Money left over} = \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine in how many years Melanie's age will be three times her present age, we start by finding her current age. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be three times her current age. Her age in \( x \) years will be \( 8 + x \). We need to find \( x \) such that her age in \( x \) years is three times her current age:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her present age. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Kelly is buying.

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly buys 5 packs of bacon.
   - Total cost for bacon: \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \) dollars.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one packet of chicken: \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) dollars.
   - Kelly buys 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost for chicken: \( 6 \times 20 = 120 \) dollars.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly buys 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost for strawberries: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

4. **Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of apples: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) dollars.
   - Kelly buys 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost for apples: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) dollars.

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
50 \text{ (bacon)} + 120 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 196 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
\[
65 - 196 = -131
\]

Since the total cost exceeds her budget, Kelly does not have any money left and in fact, she is short by $131. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{-131}
\]"
"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \(\boxed{25}\) minutes."

1. Start with the initial number of toys Argo has.
2. Subtract the number of toys given to Alyssa.
3. Subtract the number of toys given to Bonnie.
4. Subtract the number of toys given to Nicky.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Argo starts with 200 toys.
2. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa:
   \[
   200 - 40 = 160
   \]
3. He gives 80 toys to Bonnie:
   \[
   160 - 80 = 80
   \]
4. He gives 30 toys to Nicky:
   \[
   80 - 30 = 50
   \]

So, after giving away all the toys, Argo has \(\boxed{50}\) toys left."
"To determine the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of chimichangas made on each day:
   - On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
   - On Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
   - On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas as on a Tuesday or Wednesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

2. Calculate the total number of chimichangas made over the three days:
   \[
   125 \text{ (Tuesdays)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesdays)} + 250 \text{ (Fridays)} = 500
   \]

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones will not be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He also counts \(\frac{2}{3}\) of that number of birds flying overhead. Since he counted 6 birds nesting, we calculate \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) birds flying overhead.
3. He counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, the total number of birds feeding is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) birds.

Now, we add up all the birds he counted:
\[6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5 of them. So, the number of cookies left is:
\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

Next, she placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies are in each jar, we divide 50 by 5:
\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, the number of cookies in each jar is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is:
\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is:
\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We do this by subtracting the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:
\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have \(\boxed{15}\) more petals than the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[
\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
\]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Therefore, the number of outdoor plants is:

\[
\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[
\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
\]

To find the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"To determine the speed at which a whirligig spins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the speed of a thingamabob.
2. Use the speed of a thingamabob to find the speed of a whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11:

\[
\text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

\[
\text{Speed of a whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Thus, the speed at which a whirligig spins is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."
"Let's break down the costs and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the yogurt:**
   - The salad costs $6.
   - The yogurt is half the price of the salad.
   - Therefore, the cost of the yogurt is:
     \[
     \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt:**
   - The total cost of the salad and yogurt is:
     \[
     6 + 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the total cost of the carrots:**
   - Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily goods.
   - The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $9.
   - Therefore, the total cost of the carrots is:
     \[
     11 - 9 = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of one carrot:**
   - Ellen eats two carrots every day.
   - The total cost of the carrots is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost of one carrot is:

"First, let's determine Mark's new hourly wage. He used to make $10 per hour and his pay was raised by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:
\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much Mark makes in a week by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:
\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Mark makes a week is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \). According to the problem, the first week she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time he mowed his lawn. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Joe's lawn is \( 6x \). The total amount Tasha earned from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is \( 6 \times 3x + 6 \times 5x = 18x + 30x = 48x \).

The total earnings from all her work last month is the sum of the earnings from mowing lawns and selling lemonade, which is $80. So we can write the equation:
\[ 6x + 48x + \text{(earnings from lemonade)} = 80 \]
\[ 54x + \text{(earnings from lemonade)} = 80 \]

To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we calculate:
\[ 54x = 80 - \text{(earnings from lemonade)} \]

Since the total earnings are $80, and we need to find the earnings from lemonade, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the earnings from lemonade:
\[ \text{earnings from lemonade} = 80 - 54x \]

We need to determine the value of \( x \). Since the total earnings are $80 and the earnings from mowing lawns are $54x, we can find \( x \) by assuming the simplest case where the earnings from mowing lawns are a whole number. Let's solve for \( x \) by assuming the simplest case where the earnings from mowing lawns are a whole number.

If we assume \( x = 1 \):
\[ 54 \times 1 = 54 \]
\[ \text{earnings from lemonade} = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

So, Tasha made \(\boxed{26}\) dollars from lemonade sales."
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so we have:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so we get:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Thus, the weight of Harry is \(\boxed{74}\) kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting out his car each month. He rents it out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 an hour.

The total hours he rents out the car each month is:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Since he earns $25 per hour, his total earnings from renting the car each month are:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit. His car payment is $500.

So, his profit is:
\[ 750 \text{ dollars} - 500 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. According to the problem, after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has a total of 7 notebooks. Therefore, the number of notebooks Martha originally had is:
\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, the number of notebooks Joseph had is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph after her purchase. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. The difference is:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Therefore, Martha now has \(\boxed{1}\) more notebook than Joseph."
"First, we need to determine how many miles Anis rowed. According to the problem, Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Dijana rowed 50 miles, so we calculate the additional distance Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:

\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:

\[
50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

\[
\boxed{110}

"Initially, Susan made 100 cookies. Her husband then took 4 cookies for himself, leaving:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Now, these 96 cookies are to be divided equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide 96 by 6:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get \(\boxed{16}\) cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. 

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement to find the total amount of soup. Therefore, the pot contains enough soup for 4 adult bowls.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup that will be consumed by Calvin, his wife, and their two children. Since both Calvin and his wife are adults, they will each have 1 bowl, and the two children will each have 1 bowl. This means a total of 4 bowls will be consumed at the meal.

The total amount of soup is enough for 4 adult bowls, and since 4 bowls will be used up, there will be no soup left over for the children to have additional bowls for lunch.

Therefore, the number of times each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50. 

The cost for the notebooks is \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\).

So, the total amount William spent is \(7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00\).

**Final Answer:**
8.00"
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we need to find out how much material is required for 20 small masks. We know that Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. Therefore, the amount of material needed for one small mask is:
\[
\frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ small masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per small mask}
\]
So, the amount of material needed for 20 small masks is:
\[
20 \text{ small masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per small mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much material is required for 8 large masks. We know that Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. Therefore, the amount of material needed for one large mask is:
\[
\frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ large masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per large mask}
\]
So, the amount of material needed for 8 large masks is:
\[
8 \text{ large masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per large mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
\]

Finally, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks to get the total amount of material required:
\[
10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the total amount of material Jo needs is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets purchased.

First, we calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies. Since there are 9 movies and she saw each one 3 times, the total number of times she saw the movies is:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Next, we know that she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets purchased:
\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of hours Harold sleeps in a day. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.

Next, we calculate the number of hours Harold works. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so:
\[ 10 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Harold also walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, we need to find out the total number of hours Harold spends on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ hours (sleep)} + 8 \text{ hours (work)} + 1 \text{ hour (dog walk)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has left, we subtract the total hours spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} - 19 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses and how many are left.

Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and uses 3 of them:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]
So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes left.

Next, let's determine how many red shoe boxes Tim uses. He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his 9 red shoe boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]
So, Tim uses 3 red shoe boxes.

Now, let's find out how many red shoe boxes are left:

"First, let's calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean gives \( \frac{1}{5} \) of his 30 marbles to Jamie:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6
\]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. Next, we subtract these 6 marbles from Dean's original 30 marbles:

\[
30 - 6 = 24
\]

Now, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. We subtract these 10 marbles from the remaining 24 marbles:

\[
24 - 10 = 14
\]

Therefore, the number of marbles left for Dean is:

\[
\boxed{14}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine Adam's current age and then find out how old he will be in 8 years.

First, let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \). According to the problem, Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, we have:
\[ D = 60 \]

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = \frac{60}{2} \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be \(\boxed{38}\) years old in 8 years."
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

To find twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Next, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of acres for both farms combined. We add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, Colby completes 40 packages per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We do this by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works in a day:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money Colby earns for completing these 320 packages. He earns $0.20 for every package he completes. Therefore, the total earnings can be calculated as:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide 180 minutes by 30 minutes per bottle:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. We are also given that there are 20 red balloons.

First, we can express the total number of pieces of bologna thrown in terms of \( R \) and \( Y \):
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]
Since \( R = 20 \), we substitute 20 for \( R \) in the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]
Next, we isolate \( Y \) by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
Then, we solve for \( Y \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( \boxed{6} \)."
"First, calculate the total miles Jon drives in a 30-day month. Since he drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in a month is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs. Since a tune-up is required every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, the number of tune-ups Jon needs in that time is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of hours Bruce works each day.

- On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.
- On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
  \]
- On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Thursday is:
  \[
  10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Next, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Bruce works in these three days is:
\[

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total amount of money they had and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. The balloons: They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since the price is $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The ice cream: They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

This means the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had together is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance and combined it, the amount each received is:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the amount Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them is \(\boxed{14}\)."

"To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   - Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - Total lollipops sold = \( 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \).

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.
   - Total revenue = \( 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was bought for $0.5.
   - Total cost = \( 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the profit:**

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 3
   \]

2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats.
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7
   \]

4. **Fish**: Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits.
   \[
   \text{Number of fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

5. **Gerbils**: Larry has a collection of gerbils that is \(\frac{1}{3}\) the number of fish he has.
   \[
   \text{Number of gerbils} = \frac{21}{3} = 7

1. Martha started collecting shells at age 5.
2. She will have been collecting shells for \(10 - 5 = 5\) years.
3. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months she has been collecting shells is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) months.
4. Since she collects one shell each month, the total number of shells she has collected is 60.

Thus, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected \(\boxed{60}\) shells."
"First, we need to determine how many cups are in each row. Since Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows, we calculate the number of cups per row as follows:

\[
\frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ rows}} = 9 \text{ cups per row}
\]

Next, we know that in each row, the chamomile and mint tea cups are equal. Therefore, in each row, the number of chamomile tea cups is equal to the number of mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \). Consequently, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also \( x \).

Since the total number of cups in each row is 9, we can write the equation:

\[
x + x = 9
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
2x = 9
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5

   - Colby has seen 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays.
   - Each ticket costs $10.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.

2. **Movies on other days:**
   - Colby has seen 8 movies on other days.
   - Each ticket costs $7.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Popcorn:**
   - Colby has had 2 tubs of popcorn.
   - Each tub costs $8.
   - Total spent on popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.

4. **Candy:**
   - Colby has had 4 boxes of candy.
   - Each box costs $2.
   - Total spent on candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Next, let's sum up all the expenses:
\[ 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130 \text{ dollars} \]

Colby's parents give him $150 each month to spend. Therefore, the remaining amount of money he has is:
\[ 150 - 130 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's determine how many more movies Colby can see with the remaining $20. Since it is the last day of the month and it's a Friday, the tickets cost $10 each.

The number of movies he can see is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{20}{10} \right\rfloor = 2 \]

Colby also wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy that night. The cost for one popcorn and one box of candy is:
\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the popcorn and candy, the remaining money will be:
\[ 20 - 10 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

With the remaining $10, Colby can see one more movie:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{10}{10} \right\rfloor = 1 \]

Therefore, the total number of movies Colby can see that night, including the popcorn and candy, is:

   - **Tuesday:** Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
   - **Wednesday:** Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
   - **Thursday:** 48 Junebugs
   - **Friday:** 57 Junebugs

2. **Sum the total number of Junebugs removed:**
   \[
   39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
   \]

3. **Perform the addition step-by-step:**
   \[
   39 + 78 = 117
   \]
   \[
   117 + 78 = 195
   \]
   \[
   195 + 48 = 243
   \]
   \[
   243 + 57 = 300
   \]

4. **Calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day:**
   \[

"First, calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
- The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, calculate the distance traveled by the car:
- The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, find the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car:
- Difference = Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car
- Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we need to first calculate the total number of toys Sophie already had before adding the bouncy balls. We know the following:

- The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
- The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
- The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.

We can add these quantities together to find the total number of toys Sophie had before adding the bouncy balls:

\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie's total number of toys after adding the bouncy balls is 62. Let \( x \) be the number of bouncy balls. We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of toys:

\[ 48 + x = 62 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 48 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 62 - 48 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

First, substitute the expression for \( Pa \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute the expressions for \( Pa \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, substitute \( J = 20 \) back into the expressions for \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"First, let's determine the number of water balloons each person initially received. Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, and she had 1 for herself. So, initially, the total number of water balloons is:

\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} + 1 \text{ balloon for Maria} = 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the additional number of balloons is:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Adding the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons gives the total number of balloons:

\[ 9 \text{ initial balloons} + 15 \text{ additional balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:

\[
\boxed{24}

- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey = \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Next, we find the combined total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney:
- Combined total distance = \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the combined total distance by the number of participants (which is 2):
- Average total distance = \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

Therefore, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- It makes 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- For 30 days, the total number of widgets produced is \(60 \times 24 \times 30\).

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- It makes 45 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- For 30 days, the total number of widgets produced is \(45 \times 24 \times 30\).

Next, we calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[
60 \times 24 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ widgets}
\]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[
45 \times 24 \times 30 = 32400 \text{ widgets}

Now, we calculate the revenue from selling these widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[
43200 \times 6 = 259200 \text{ dollars}
\]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[
32400 \times 6 = 194400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

\[
259200 - 194400 = 64800 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's determine the total duration of Cameron's stay. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This means he stays from 5 pm to 10 am, which is 17 hours.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For every hour after the 12-hour mark, the hotel charges an additional 70 pesos.

The number of hours after the initial 12-hour period is:
\[ 17 - 12 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The cost for these additional 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, the cost would have been:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the hay needed for each sheep as follows:

\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the overall total:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so his remaining money after the deposit is:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the pencils, the remaining money John has is:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, we add the total number of letters spelled by Craig and his brother to find the total number of letters spelled after the ten rounds:
\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"To determine the total number of children participating in the mass drill, we need to calculate the number of children from each school and then sum them up.

1. Each row has 8 children.
2. There are 7 rows for each school.
3. There are 5 different schools.

First, calculate the number of children in one school:
\[
8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ children/school}
\]

Next, calculate the total number of children from all 5 schools:
\[
56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children}
\]

Thus, the total number of children in the drill is:
\[
\boxed{280}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming her coupons. Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, and the teacher has 9 coupons. Therefore, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice required for the 29 students. Each student gets 2 bottles, so the total number of bottles needed for the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[ \boxed{842} \]"
"To determine the total charge for the job, we need to consider the fixed visit charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Fixed Visit Charge**: Patty's Plumbing charges $40 to visit the house.
2. **Labor Charge**: The labor rate is $35 per hour, or part thereof. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we need to calculate the labor charge for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). Therefore, the labor charge is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105
   \]
3. **Parts Cost**: The cost of parts used was $60.

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total charge:
\[
\$40 + \$105 + \$60 = \$205
\]

Thus, the total charge for the job is \(\boxed{205}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount. Each CD costs $15, so the total cost is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount. A 40% discount means James pays 60% of the original price. So, the cost after the discount is:
\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling the 5 CDs. The amount he was out initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling the CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:
\[ 90 - 200 = -110 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To determine how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

1. **Yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam is sold for $1.5.
   - Total earnings from yams: \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \) dollars.

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato is sold for $2.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) dollars.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots: \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the earnings from all the root crops:
\[ 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \]

Therefore, Jen will earn a total of \(\boxed{34}\) dollars."
"To determine the total time James took to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the first part:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   James swims at half the original speed.
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   Add the time taken to swim the first part, the rest time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is \(\boxed{17}\) hours."
"To determine how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we start by identifying the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. According to the problem, Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. We can express this relationship with the following calculation:

1. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had:
   \[
   7 \times 70 = 490
   \]

2. Subtract 40 from the result to find the number of loaves the bakery has:
   \[
   490 - 40 = 450
   \]

Therefore, the bakery has \(\boxed{450}\) loaves of bread."

1. Jasmine starts with 0 stickers.
2. She is given 15 stickers for participating in class.
   \[
   0 + 15 = 15
   \]
3. She loses 7 stickers during playtime.
   \[
   15 - 7 = 8
   \]
4. Her teacher gives her another 5 stickers for helping her classmates.
   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]

So, at the end, Jasmine has \(\boxed{13}\) stickers."
"To determine Cayley's total commission, we need to calculate the commission from each type of newspaper separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies of the New York Times.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 10\% \times 5 = 0.10 \times 5 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 8\% \times 15 = 0.08 \times 15 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

1. Calculate Marcus's age:
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

2. Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age:
\[ \text{Leo's age} = 2 \times \text{Marcus's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the three individuals is 45, so we have:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us the following equations:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

To verify, we check the total points:
\[ B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 \]
The total is correct. Therefore, the number of points Azibo scored is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The paper is stacked such that 100 pages occupy 1 inch.
   - The book is 1.5 inches thick.
   - Each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, with one page per side.

2. **Calculate the number of pages per inch:**
   - Since 100 pages occupy 1 inch, the number of pages per inch is 100.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:**
   - If 1 inch contains 100 pages, then 1.5 inches will contain:
     \[
     1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages/inch} = 150 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Account for both sides of each sheet:**
   - Each sheet of paper has 2 pages (one on each side).
   - Therefore, the total number of sheets of paper is:
     \[
     \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages/sheet}} = 75 \text{ sheets}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of pages in the book:**
   - Since each sheet has 2 pages, the total number of pages in the book is:
     \[
     150 \text{ pages}
     \]

Thus, the total number of pages in the book is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and ended at 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert this time into minutes because Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate Kim's usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Determine the time Kim woke up that day:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - 6 a.m. is 6:00.
   - 5 minutes earlier is 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before getting out of bed:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m.
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 3:15 a.m. is 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - From 3:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 2 hours and 40 minutes (160 minutes).
   - Total time awake before getting out of bed: \( 60 + 160 = 220 \) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - Time from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. is 23 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake that day:**
   - Time awake before getting out of bed: 220 minutes.
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Total time awake: \( 220 + 23 = 243 \) minutes.

6. **Calculate the total time Kim was in bed that day:**
   - Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes.
   - Total time awake: 243 minutes.
   - Time in bed: \( 480 - 243 = 237 \) minutes.

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is \(\boxed{237}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. According to the problem, he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:
\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and is currently occupied by \( \frac{1}{5} \) of its capacity.

\[
\text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
\]

This means the initial number of unoccupied beds is:

\[
\text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

Next, we need to calculate the number of new patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Total new patients in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700
\]

These new patients will occupy the unoccupied beds. Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks will be:

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 800 - 700 = 100
\]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"First, we determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we calculate the number of emails that are sent to family. Two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to family:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means the number of emails that are not work emails and not to family is:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

One-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

So, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we determine Shawna's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:
\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate the age of Shawna's father. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so we have:
\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Thus, the age of Shawna's father is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"If Courtney reported 48 people in attendance and Kelly says that number is 20% more than the actual number, we need to find the actual number of people.

Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

According to the problem, Courtney's number (48) is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan. Therefore, the total number of balls is:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then the number of balls Jeffrey carried would be half of Jason's, and the number of balls Jordan carried would be twice Jeffrey's. So, if Jason carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey carried \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) ball, and Jordan carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls. Therefore, the total number of balls is:
\[ 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \]

Since the total number of balls is the same in both scenarios, we have:
\[ 7J = 5 \]
\[ J = \frac{5}{7} \]

However, since the number of balls must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem in the context of the given conditions. The only way the conditions can be met with whole numbers is if the total number of balls is 5, and the values of \( J \), \( 2J \), and \( 4J \) must be scaled appropriately to fit the condition that if Jason carried 2 balls, the others would carry accordingly.

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes on the island at the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes on the island at the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

Next, we need to find out how many holes were on the island at the end of the third day. Since they filled in 2 holes, the number of holes at the end of the third day is:
\[ 29 - 2 = 27 \]

According to the problem, the number of holes on the island at the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day is 10. Therefore, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[ 40 - 27 = 13 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"To determine the total number of corn chips, let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \). According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey. Therefore, we can express \( C \) as:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total cost of the tickets for travel. The problem states that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400. 

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \). According to the problem, Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, and Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon. The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Then, divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon, we can find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:

\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, the number of Pokemon that Stan has caught is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend watching all the episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

\[
\boxed{200}

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Northerly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we sum the distances traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction:

- Total distance traveled southerly: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Total distance traveled northerly: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

The net distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had at the start of the day:

1. Greta made 1 dozen (12 brownies) of cream cheese swirl brownies.
2. She received 1/2 dozen (6 brownies) from her office party.
3. Her friends had 4 dozen (48 brownies) waiting for her.

Adding these together, the total number of brownies Greta had is:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Next, we need to account for the brownies that were eaten during the surprise party:

1. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 dozen or \( 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \) brownies.

Subtracting the eaten brownies from the total, the number of brownies left is:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

So, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"First, let's determine the age of Nani's brother. Since Nani is 8 years old and his brother is twice his age, we calculate the brother's age as follows:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Next, we need to find the age of Nani's sister. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. This means her age is 75% of Nani's age (since 100% - 25% = 75%). We calculate her age as follows:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

Thus, the total age of all three family members is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"

   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time: \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes

3. **Hybrid Sets:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time: \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes

Now, we sum the total times for each type of stringing:
\[45 + 110 + 72 = 227\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets is \(\boxed{227}\) minutes."
"To determine how much John paid for the phones, we need to break down the cost step by step.

1. Identify the number of phones John is buying. He is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.
2. Determine the price of the first two phones. Each of these phones costs $600.
3. Determine the price of the remaining two phones. Each of these phones is half price, so each costs $600 / 2 = $300.
4. Calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining two phones.

The total cost is calculated as follows:
\[ 600 + 600 + 300 + 300 = 1800 \]

So, the total amount John paid for the phones is \(\boxed{1800}\)."

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players. Next, we find the total number of players in both teams combined by adding the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ 20 + 13 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wood slats required is:

\[ \text{Total number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{100}

"First, we need to determine the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially bought. She bought 12 boxes.

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtracting the boxes given away from the total number of boxes, we find the number of boxes she has left:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she has left is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ oranges} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the oranges for herself. Therefore, the number of oranges she kept is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 160 = 40 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges she had left:
\[ 160 - 40 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Thus, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( S \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{S}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = S + \left( \frac{S}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = S + \frac{S}{2} + 4 = \frac{2S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + 4 = \frac{3S}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( S = 50 \). Substituting \( S = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these amounts together, we get:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost of the books:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs $25 more to afford the books. Since he earns $5 per hour, we need to determine how many hours he has to work to earn $25. We do this by dividing the amount of money he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work \(\boxed{5}\) hours to afford the books."
"To determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of cherries each person has:**
   - Robert has 30 cherries.
   - Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has:
     \[
     30 - 10 = 20 \text{ cherries}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of cherries Jerry has:**
   - The total number of cherries is 60.
   - The total number of cherries that Robert and Richard have together is:
     \[
     30 + 20 = 50 \text{ cherries}
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of cherries Jerry has is:
     \[
     60 - 50 = 10 \text{ cherries}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:**
   - Robert has 30 cherries.
   - Jerry has 10 cherries.
   - The difference is:

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both Saturday and Sunday, and then find the total earnings.

First, let's determine the number of boxes sold on each day:

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Let's calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday:
- Gingerbread on Sunday: \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes
- Apple pie on Sunday: 15 boxes

Now, we can find the total number of boxes sold on each day:
- Total gingerbread on Saturday: 10 boxes
- Total gingerbread on Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total gingerbread over two days: \(10 + 15 = 25\) boxes

- Total apple pie on Saturday: \(10 - 4 = 6\) boxes
- Total apple pie on Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total apple pie over two days: \(6 + 15 = 21\) boxes

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of baked good:
- Earnings from gingerbread: \(25 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 \text{ per box} = \$150\)
- Earnings from apple pie: \(21 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 \text{ per box} = \$315\)

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of baked goods to find the total earnings:
\[
\$150 + \$315 = \$465
\]

Thus, the total amount Sunny earned over the two days is \(\boxed{465}\)."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need to pack, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use during her vacation.
2. Determine how many bottles are required based on the total usage.

\[ 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 8-ounce bottles are required to provide 32 ounces of sunscreen. We do this by dividing the total amount of sunscreen needed by the amount each bottle contains:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"The price of the blue car is $100. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we need to calculate 40% of $100 and subtract that from $100 to find the price of the red car.

First, calculate 40% of $100:
\[ 40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car costs:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

The total cost of both cars is:

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - He will turn 24 in \(24 - 19 = 5\) years.

2. **Determine the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Let \(D\) be the current age of Emil's dad.
   - In 5 years, Emil's dad will be \(D + 5\) years old.
   - According to the problem, \(24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)\).

3. **Solve for \(D\):**
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   48 = D + 5
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   D = 43
   \]
   So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

4. **Determine the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Let \(B\) be the current age of Emil's brother.
   - In 5 years, Emil's brother will be \(B + 5\) years old.
   - According to the problem, \(24 = 2(B + 5)\).

5. **Solve for \(B\):**
   \[
   24 = 2(B + 5)
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   12 = B + 5
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   B = 7
   \]
   So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we calculate the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate 25% of 24:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of pretzels he eats per day by 7:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63
\]

Thus, Edgar's brother eats \(\boxed{63}\) pretzels in a week."
"First, let's calculate the cost for one hanging basket.

For each basket:
- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias.
- Each petunia costs $3.00, so the cost for the petunias in one basket is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dollars.
- Katherine also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50, so the cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is \(2 \times 2.50 = 5\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost for one basket is:
\[9 + 5 = 14 \text{ dollars}\]

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost for all the baskets is:
\[5 \times 14 = 70 \text{ dollars}\]

So, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. Since they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. Since they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations to find the total soil used so far:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the amount of soil left for planting roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Thus, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, we need to determine how much money Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money she can spend on shoes each month. Since she sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes, and each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, we need to determine how many pairs she can buy each month.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \text{ pairs} \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we divide 12 by 2.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the problem into two parts: peeling the shrimp and sautéing them.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we calculate the time required as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, we need to determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are required and the total time:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes, the total time to sauté 90 shrimp is:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to complete both tasks (peeling and sautéing) is the sum of the time for each task:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is \(\boxed{45}\) minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the final temperature of the room.

1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours.
   - It cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Subsequent Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner is then turned up to high for 4 hours.
   - It cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ degrees/hour} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **Warming Up:**
   - The air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours.
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming during this period: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

4. **Net Change in Temperature:**
   - Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Net change in temperature: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\).

Therefore, the final temperature of the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

   - Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - The time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

Thus, the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of electric bill checks per year is:
     \[
     1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

2. **Gas bill checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of gas bill checks per year is:
     \[
     1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

3. **Church checks:**
   - Buford writes two checks per month to the church.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of church checks per year is:
     \[
     2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

4. **Pest and lawn service checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per quarter to the pest and lawn service.
   - There are 4 quarters in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of pest and lawn service checks per year is:
     \[
     1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52 \text{ checks/year}
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
\boxed{52}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France and the number of flights to Germany are each \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips each day. It is given that the 44 trips of the second plane are half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 44 = \frac{1}{2}F \]
Solving for \( F \), we get:
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France. Since the first plane makes 88 flights in one day and \( \frac{1}{4} \) of these flights are to France, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.

3. **Igneous's howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls.
   - The combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

Next, we calculate the total duration of all three wolves' howls:
\[
20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[
\frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"First, let's determine how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Adam's father gave him $12. Now, we add the amounts given by his mother and father to find the total amount of money Adam received from them:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam's trousers cost $30, so we need to find out how much more money he needs to cover the cost after receiving the money from his parents. We subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. Akbar's age \( A = 3 \) years.
2. Alessandro's age \( B = 4 \) years.
3. The total age of the children is 20 years, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can substitute the known ages of Akbar and Alessandro into the total age equation:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is given by:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene's age is twice the average age of the group, we have:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. The amount collected from his neighbors is $500, and the amount collected from the online fund is $1500. Adding these together, we get:

\[500 + 1500 = 2000\]

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. According to the problem, the lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

\[3 \times 2000 = 6000\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[\boxed{6000}\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 2 \text{ (adults)} \times 2x \text{ (each adult's slice)} + 4 \text{ (kids)} \times x \text{ (each kid's slice)} = 4x + 4x = 8x. \]

The total size of the watermelon is equivalent to the sum of all the slices, which is \( 8x \).

Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\%. \]

So, each adult gets \(\boxed{25\%}\) of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on his inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient. Therefore, the total time spent on rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the time spent on rounds from minutes to hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on his appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

We convert the time spent on appointments from minutes to hours:

\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and the time spent on appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones is spending a total of 9 hours at the clinic. Therefore, the time left for updating his records is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready by 5:00 pm, we need to work backwards from the end time, accounting for all the steps required to make the cake.

1. **Frosting the cake**: 10 minutes
2. **Cooling the cake**: 2 hours (120 minutes)
3. **Baking the cake**: 30 minutes
4. **Making the cake batter**: 20 minutes

Let's add up the total time required for all these steps:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes (frosting)} + 120 \text{ minutes (cooling)} + 30 \text{ minutes (baking)} + 20 \text{ minutes (making batter)} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert 180 minutes into hours:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, subtract this total time from the desired completion time (5:00 pm):
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is:
\[ \boxed{2:00 \text{ pm}} \]"
"To determine how many chocolate bars are in a box, we start by defining the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars. Peter sold 4.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Thus, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to break down the costs and earnings step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost per session:**
   - Fixed cost per session: $25
   - Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Number of students: 10
   - Total variable cost per session: \( 10 \times 1.50 = 15 \) dollars
   - Total cost per session: \( 25 + 15 = 40 \) dollars

2. **Calculate the number of sessions per week:**
   - The studio is rented 3 days a week.
   - Number of sessions per week: 3

3. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - Total cost per week: \( 40 \times 3 = 120 \) dollars

4. **Calculate the monthly earnings:**
   - Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the monthly earnings are:
   - Total monthly earnings: \( 120 \times 4 = 480 \) dollars

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:
\[
\boxed{480}
\]"
"To determine how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:**
   - Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes.
   - Therefore, \( 4x = 64 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{64}{4} = 16
     \]
   - So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars per box.

2. **Determine the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha:**
   - Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes.
   - Therefore, \( 7y = 56 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{56}{7} = 8
     \]
   - So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars per box.

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha:**
   - The difference is \( x - y \).
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     x - y = 16 - 8 = 8
     \]

Thus, Peter has \(\boxed{8}\) more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To determine the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of female porcupines:**
   The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of male porcupines:**
   The number of male porcupines is the total population minus the number of female porcupines.
   \[
   \text{Number of male porcupines} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of porcupine babies born each month:**
   Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:
   \[
   \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of porcupine babies born in a year:**
   Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:
   \[
   \text{Number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:**
   The initial population of porcupines is 50, and after a year, 1440 new porcupines are added.
   \[
   \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, we calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, we multiply the result by 4:

\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Calculating this:

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Calculating this:

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each type of stick and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks:**
   The number of red sticks is given as 9.

2. **Blue Sticks:**
   The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue sticks} = 9 + 5 = 14
   \]

3. **Yellow Sticks:**
   The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow sticks} = 14 - 3 = 11
   \]

4. **Total Number of Sticks:**
   To find the total number of sticks, we sum the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:
   \[
   \text{Total number of sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34
   \]

Thus, the total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then find the difference between these distances.

First, we calculate the distance traveled by Matteo. The formula for distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Speed} = 55 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 4 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \times 4 = 220 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by Shandy:
\[ \text{Speed} = 45 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 10 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \times 10 = 450 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 - 220 = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Shandy drove \(\boxed{230}\) miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's determine the number of students who are over 16 years old and the number of students who are under 16 years old.

The total number of students at Brook Hills High School is 3000. Half of these students are over 16 years old:
\[
\text{Number of students over 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
\]
The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old:
\[
\text{Number of students under 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
\]

Next, we calculate the number of male students over 16 years old. One-fourth of the students over 16 are male:
\[
\text{Number of male students over 16} = \frac{1500}{4} = 375
\]
The number of female students over 16 years old is the total number of students over 16 minus the number of male students over 16:
\[
\text{Number of female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
\]

Now, we calculate the number of male students under 16 years old. One-half of the students under 16 are male:
\[
\text{Number of male students under 16} = \frac{1500}{2} = 750
\]
The number of female students under 16 years old is the total number of students under 16 minus the number of male students under 16:
\[
\text{Number of female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750
\]

Finally, the total number of female students at the school is the sum of the female students over 16 and the female students under 16:
\[
\text{Total number of female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875
\]

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at this school is:
\[
\boxed{1875}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run in one hour.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so:
   \[
   \text{Trey's laps} = 10 + 4 = 14
   \]
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so:
   \[
   \text{Shaelyn's laps} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so:
   \[
   \text{Quinn's laps} = 7 - 2 = 5
   \]

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:
\[
\text{Difference} = 10 - 5 = 5
\]

Therefore, Bethany can run \(\boxed{5}\) more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the amount Wanda pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the first day:
     \[
     4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the second day:
     \[
     3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days:**
   \[
   7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining capacity of the tank:**
   \[
   18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \).

First, we calculate the charge remaining after 5 hours, during which the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. The charge remaining after each hour can be calculated as follows:

After 1 hour, the charge is \( x \times (1 - 0.09) = x \times 0.91 \).

After 2 hours, the charge is \( x \times 0.91 \times 0.91 = x \times 0.91^2 \).

After 3 hours, the charge is \( x \times 0.91^3 \).

After 4 hours, the charge is \( x \times 0.91^4 \).

After 5 hours, the charge is \( x \times 0.91^5 \).

So, after 5 hours, the charge is \( x \times 0.91^5 \).

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. So, the charge remaining after these 3 hours is:

After 6 hours, the charge is \( x \times 0.91^5 \times (1 - 0.07) = x \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93 \).

After 7 hours, the charge is \( x \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93 \times 0.93 = x \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^2 \).

After 8 hours, the charge is \( x \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^2 \times 0.93 = x \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \).

We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28% of the initial charge, so we can write the equation:

\[ x \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28x \]

We can cancel \( x \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( x \neq 0 \)):

\[ 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \). First, we calculate the left side of the equation:

\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.624 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.804 \]
\[ 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \approx 0.624 \times 0.804 \approx 0.501 \]

However, we know that \( 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \), so we can directly use this to find \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.91^5 \times 0.93^3} \]

Since we already know that \( 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \), we have:

\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.28} = 1 \]

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was \( \boxed{100} \)."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, making her total hourly earnings $25 per hour. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 1000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Janet wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. Therefore, the amount she needs to save is:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000. Since she earns $1000 per week, the number of weeks required is:

\[ \frac{2000 \text{ dollars}}{1000 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- The cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- The cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- The cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- The cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, we need to determine the total number of sweets Anne purchased. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is calculated as follows:
\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, Anne kept 2 packs for herself. Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces she kept is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how many pieces of sweets Anne gave to her friends, we subtract the number of pieces she kept from the total number of pieces:
\[ 900 - 120 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:
\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces of sweets each of her friends received is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Next, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \]
\[ 1.05 \times 1.05 = 1.1025 \]
\[ 1.1025 \times 1.05 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this result by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she uploaded 72 pictures and distributed them equally into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums contain only selfies and 2 of the albums contain only portraits. Therefore, the total number of pictures in the albums that contain only selfies is:

\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And the total number of pictures in the albums that contain only portraits is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of portraits and selfies:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, we need to determine how long it takes James to read one page of his book. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time per page as follows:

\[
\text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time per page by the number of pages:

\[
\text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page}
\]

To perform the multiplication, we can simplify the expression:

\[
18 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{18 \times 10}{3} = \frac{180}{3} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time James spends reading is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the final number of guests in the hotel.

1. **Initial number of guests:**
   The hotel starts with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkouts:**
   24 guests elected to check out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

3. **Late checkouts:**
   15 guests elected to check out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

4. **Afternoon check-ins:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests checked in}
   \]
   Adding these to the remaining guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91 \text{ guests}
   \]

5. **Additional check-ins after dinner:**
   7 more people checked in after dinner.
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98 \text{ guests}
   \]

Thus, the final number of guests in the hotel is:
\[
\boxed{98}

"To determine how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions: 60
   - Percentage of easy questions: 40%
     \[
     \text{Number of easy questions} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24
     \]
   - The remaining questions are average and difficult:
     \[
     \text{Number of average and difficult questions} = 60 - 24 = 36
     \]
   - Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided:
     \[
     \text{Number of average questions} = \text{Number of difficult questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions:
     \[
     \text{Number of easy questions Aries gets correct} = 0.75 \times 24 = 18

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so we have:
\[ L = 3S \]
We are also given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so:
\[ S = 4 \]
Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ L = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is:
\[ x \times L = x \times 12 \]
The total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is:
\[ 2x \times S = 2x \times 4 = 8x \]
The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is given as $120, so we can write the equation:
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 20x = 120 \]
Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]
So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6, and the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"First, let's determine the amount of ore one dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe. We know that:

1. One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much as with his bare hands, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is \(24 \times 1.5 = 36\) pounds per day.

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe. The amount of ore one dwarf can mine in a month is \(36 \times 30 = 1080\) pounds. Therefore, the amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month is \(1080 \times 40 = 43200\) pounds.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3.
- Therefore, the price per sandwich is \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) dollars.

Next, let's verify that the price per sandwich is consistent with the second package:
- The second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6.
- Therefore, the price per sandwich is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) dollars.

Since the price per sandwich is consistent, we can use this price to find the cost of the third package:
- The third package contains 8 sandwiches.
- Therefore, the cost of the third package is \(8 \times 1.5 = 12\) dollars.

The cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is \(\boxed{12}\)."

"First, let's determine the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst:
\[ 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]
So, the number of red balloons remaining is:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

As Sally neared the school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons:
\[ 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \]
So, the number of blue balloons she added is 6. Adding these to her remaining balloons (red, green, and yellow), we get:
\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 7 \text{ (green)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 34 \]

Thus, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% = 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% = 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (since 100% - 40% = 60%) = 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% = 0.20
   - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum these probabilities to find the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

\[
0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.92
\]

This means there is a 92% chance that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:

\[
100\% - 92\% = 8\%
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} + 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 1250 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans and then use these relationships to find the number of small jelly beans he can consume.

1. **Determine the number of medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Since it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up, the number of medium-sized jelly beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

2. **Determine the number of small jelly beans equivalent to the medium-sized jelly beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized jelly beans is:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450
     \]

Thus, the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \(\boxed{450}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so the total hours are:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day, and she works for 3 days, so her total earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate her total parking expenses. She has to pay $3 for parking each day, and she works for 3 days, so her total parking expenses are:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we find her net earnings after subtracting the parking expenses from her total earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate her pay per hour after expenses. She worked a total of 18 hours, so her pay per hour is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle of soda every 3 feet.
   - The number of intervals between the bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \) intervals.
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Determine the time to drop the candy in each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since there are 9 bottles, he will need to make 8 trips (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the eighth to the ninth).

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The total time is \( 8 \text{ trips} \times 5 \text{ seconds/trip} = 40 \text{ seconds} \).

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \(\boxed{40}\) seconds."

"First, we calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese. Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the mozzarella cheese. Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \]

Now, we find the total cost of the cheese by adding the cost of the Parmesan and the mozzarella:
\[ \$22 + \$18 = \$40 \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the amount of money she started with:
\[ \$50 - \$40 = \$10 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim takes out during his 4 years of college:
\[ 50,000 \text{ dollars/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 200,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine Jim's income before and after college. Before college, he earned $25,000 per year. After earning his degree, his income triples:
\[ 25,000 \text{ dollars/year} \times 3 = 75,000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total income lost during the 4 years of college. Since he was earning $25,000 per year before college, the total income lost is:
\[ 25,000 \text{ dollars/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 100,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the total amount of loans to the total income lost gives us the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to break even:
\[ 200,000 \text{ dollars} + 100,000 \text{ dollars} = 300,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how long it will take Jim to earn $300,000 at his new income of $75,000 per year:
\[ \frac{300,000 \text{ dollars}}{75,000 \text{ dollars/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Jim \(\boxed{4}\) years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece. The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For one fabric piece:
\[ A = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday's Deliveries:**
   The post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Deliveries:**
   On Tuesday, the post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many letters as on Monday. First, we calculate one-fifth of Monday's deliveries:
   \[
   \frac{425}{5} = 85
   \]
   Then, we add 17 to this amount:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday's Deliveries:**
   On Wednesday, the post office delivered 5 more than twice as many letters as on Tuesday. First, we calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this amount:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

4. **Total Deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:**
   Now, we sum the deliveries from all three days:
   \[
   425 + 102 + 209 = 736
   \]

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is \(\boxed{736}\)."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average over the three races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Loss in the first race: \( L_1 = 5 \)

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Amount won in the second race: \( W_2 = 2 \times L_1 + 1 = 2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Loss in the third race: \( L_3 = 1.5 \times W_2 = 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5 \)

4. **Total Loss:**
   - Total loss is the sum of the losses in all three races.
   - Total loss: \( L_1 + L_3 = 5 + 16.5 = 21.5 \)

5. **Average Loss:**
   - To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races.
   - Average loss: \( \frac{21.5}{3} \approx 7.17 \)

Therefore, the average loss per race is \(\boxed{7.17}\)."

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches since the final heights of both Cole and Xavier will be in inches.

1. **Xavier's height now:**
   - Xavier was originally 4 feet tall.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
   - Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer.
   - Therefore, Xavier's current height is \(48 + 3 = 51\) inches.

2. **Cole's height now:**
   - Cole was originally 50 inches tall.
   - Cole grew 2 inches over the summer.
   - Therefore, Cole's current height is \(50 + 2 = 52\) inches.

3. **Difference in height between Cole and Xavier:**
   - Cole's height now is 52 inches.
   - Xavier's height now is 51 inches.
   - The difference is \(52 - 51 = 1\) inch.

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is \(\boxed{1}\) inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \) dollars.
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \) dollars.

The total amount of money is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

First, simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Then, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the time worked per day into hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the hours worked per day by the team is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is:
     \[
     3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - The team worked 9 hours each day for 21 days.
   - Therefore, the total hours worked by the team is:
     \[
     9 \times 21 = 189 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - Therefore, the hours worked by each painter is:
     \[
     \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
     \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{47.25}

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

First, combine the terms involving \( x \):
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot (2x) + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is \( x = 6 \). To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010, which is a period of 3 years. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

The formula to calculate the value of the car after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and \( n \) is 3 years. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in the year 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
\]

Now, we need to find the number of books written in Spanish. We do this by subtracting the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[
\text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of Spanish books is:

\[
\boxed{20}

Next, we need to find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive. The total distance from San Diego to New York City is 1955 kilometers. Therefore, the remaining distance is:

\[ 1955 \text{ km} - 1300 \text{ km} = 655 \text{ km} \]

So, the number of kilometers Bernice still needs to drive is:

\[ \boxed{655} \]"
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's start by determining the number of people on the train after each stop.

Initially, Romeo boards a train with 120 people.

**First Stop:**
- 20 more people board the train.
- Number of people on the train: \(120 + 20 = 140\).

**Second Stop:**
- 50 people descend from the train.
- Number of people on the train: \(140 - 50 = 90\).
- Twice the number of people who descended (50) board the train, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\).
- Number of people on the train: \(90 + 100 = 190\).

**Third Stop:**
- 80 more people descend from the train.
- Number of people on the train: \(190 - 80 = 110\).

Thus, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is \(\boxed{110}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. **Tank top**: The cost is $10.
2. **Running shorts**: The cost is $5 more than the tank top, so:
   \[
   10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Tennis shoes**: The original price is $48, but they are on sale for half price, so:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Athletic socks**: The original price is $8, but Alison has a $2 off coupon, so:
   \[

"First, we need to calculate the new monthly cost of the insurance after the increase due to the accident. The normal cost of the insurance is $120 per month, and it increased by 60%.

To find the increase in cost:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of sheets Greg uses each week. He puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since each twin bed requires one set of sheets and each king size bed also requires one set of sheets, he uses 4 twin sets and 1 king set of sheets per week.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of sheets used in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
- The number of twin sets used in a year is \(4 \text{ sets/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 208 \text{ sets/year}\).
- The number of king sets used in a year is \(1 \text{ set/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 52 \text{ sets/year}\).

Now, we need to determine how many loads of laundry Greg needs to do. The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time. Therefore, the number of loads for the twin sets is:
\[
\frac{208 \text{ sets}}{2 \text{ sets/load}} = 104 \text{ loads}
\]
And the number of loads for the king sets is:
\[
\frac{52 \text{ sets}}{1 \text{ set/load}} = 52 \text{ loads}
\]
Adding these together gives the total number of loads of laundry per year:
\[
104 \text{ loads} + 52 \text{ loads} = 156 \text{ loads}
\]
Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{156}

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( D \). We do this by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. James receives 80 emails a day, and 20% of these emails don't require any response. Therefore, the number of emails that don't require a response is:

\[ 80 \times \frac{20}{100} = 80 \times 0.2 = 16 \]

This means that the number of emails that do require a response is:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

James responds to these 64 emails every day. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is:

"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left from their order.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left from their order.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out. Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Therefore, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of the small coupons and the cost of the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. According to the problem, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in these 7 sub sandwiches is:

\[ 7 \times 4 = 28 \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Therefore, the number of sub sandwiches remaining after Mark ate 4 is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney now has is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

6. **Calculate the total cost for 2 pounds:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 2 pounds} = \$4.00 + \$2.00 = \$6.00
   \]

7. **Determine how many sets of 2 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sets of 2 pounds} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
   \]

8. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 6 pounds} = 3 \times \$6.00 = \$18.00
   \]

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited. She invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. Adding these together gives:

\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests who will actually attend the party is:

\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests, plus $6 for each additional guest. The number of additional guests is:

\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:

\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the base rental fee and the cost for the additional guests gives the total cost of the party:

\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:

\[
\boxed{251}
\]"
"Let's start by determining how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

1. **Maggie's Initial Amount:**
   - Maggie spent a quarter of her money and was left with $60.
   - Let \( M \) be the initial amount of money Maggie had.
   - Maggie spent \(\frac{1}{4}M\), so she has \(\frac{3}{4}M\) left.
   - We know \(\frac{3}{4}M = 60\).
   - Solving for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
     \]
   - Therefore, Maggie initially had $80.

2. **Riza's Initial Amount:**
   - Riza spent one-third of her money and was left with $60.
   - Let \( R \) be the initial amount of money Riza had.
   - Riza spent \(\frac{1}{3}R\), so she has \(\frac{2}{3}R\) left.
   - We know \(\frac{2}{3}R = 60\).
   - Solving for \( R \):
     \[
     R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
     \]
   - Therefore, Riza initially had $90.

3. **Total Money Spent:**
   - Maggie spent \(\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\) dollars.
   - Riza spent \(\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30\) dollars.
   - Total money spent by both:
     \[
     20 + 30 = 50
     \]

4. **Total Money Left:**
   - Total initial money:
     \[
     80 + 90 = 170
     \]
   - Total money left:
     \[
     170 - 50 = 120
     \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Maggie and Riza have left is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas to feed his three monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we calculate the daily banana consumption for each monkey.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Now, we need to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day. Let's denote the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day as \(x\).

The total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[10 + 14 + x = 24 + x\]

Since the total number of bananas consumed in a week is 315, the total number of bananas consumed in a day is:
\[\frac{315}{7} = 45\]

So, we have the equation:
\[24 + x = 45\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 45 - 24 = 21\]

Therefore, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."

First, calculate the number of pieces Teddy finished from the first puzzle:
\[
\frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, calculate the number of pieces in the second puzzle that Teddy finished:
\[
500 \text{ pieces}
\]

Now, add the pieces from both puzzles to find the total number of pieces Teddy placed:
\[
250 + 500 = 750 \text{ pieces}
\]

Thus, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five $5 bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to buy the roses. Therefore, she cannot complete the purchase and will not receive any change. 

Thus, the number of quarters she leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of item sold and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the revenue from milkshakes:**
   - Terry sells 6 milkshakes.
   - Each milkshake is priced at $5.50.
   - Revenue from milkshakes = \( 6 \times 5.50 \).

\[
6 \times 5.50 = 33
\]

2. **Calculate the revenue from burger platters:**
   - Terry sells 9 burger platters.
   - Each burger platter is priced at $11.
   - Revenue from burger platters = \( 9 \times 11 \).

\[
9 \times 11 = 99
\]

3. **Calculate the revenue from sodas:**
   - Terry sells 20 sodas.
   - Each soda is priced at $1.50.
   - Revenue from sodas = \( 20 \times 1.50 \).

\[
20 \times 1.50 = 30
\]

4. **Sum the revenues from all items:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from milkshakes + Revenue from burger platters + Revenue from sodas.

\[
33 + 99 + 30 = 162
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Terry makes is \(\boxed{162}\)."
"Let's break down the timeline of the train arrivals and departures step by step.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the first train departs.
   - The first train departs 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after it arrived.
   - So, the second train arrives 30 + 20 = 50 minutes after Paul arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Departs after 5 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 5 minutes after the second train departs.
   - The second train departs 50 + 5 = 55 minutes after Paul arrives.
   - So, the third train arrives 55 minutes after Paul arrives.
   - The third train departs immediately after it arrives, so it departs 55 minutes after Paul arrives.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs.
   - The third train departs 55 minutes after Paul arrives.
   - So, the fourth train arrives 55 + 20 = 75 minutes after Paul arrives.

Paul will board the fourth train, which arrives 75 minutes after he arrives at the station. Therefore, Paul will wait for his train for 75 minutes.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{75}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to collect to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks required:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can determine how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the number of additional weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price. Therefore, the price Mr. Rogers paid is calculated as follows:

\[
2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
\]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, the selling price to his friend is:

\[
1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
\]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and the friend paid $1800 for it. The discount amount is:

\[
2000 - 1800 = 200
\]

The percentage discount is then calculated by dividing the discount amount by the original price and multiplying by 100:

\[
\left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
\]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the rate at which one spring creates jellyfish.
2. Calculate the number of jellyfish one spring creates in 4 hours.
3. Calculate the number of jellyfish 5 springs create in 4 hours.

Step 1: The rate at which one spring creates jellyfish is 1 jellyfish per second.

Step 2: Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours.
\[ 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ 240 \text{ minutes} = 240 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 14400 \text{ seconds} \]
So, one spring creates:
\[ 14400 \text{ jellyfish} \text{ in 4 hours} \]

Step 3: Calculate the number of jellyfish 5 springs create in 4 hours.
\[ 5 \text{ springs} \times 14400 \text{ jellyfish per spring} = 72000 \text{ jellyfish} \]

\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score was 195."
"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total distance James walked:**
   - James walked halfway to the store and then walked back home.
   - The distance from his home to the store is 4 miles.
   - Halfway to the store is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
   - Therefore, the total distance James walked is \( 2 \) miles (to the halfway point) + \( 2 \) miles (back home) = \( 4 \) miles.

2. **Determine the time it took James to walk the total distance:**
   - James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
   - The time taken to walk a distance is given by the formula: \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \).
   - Substituting the values, we get: \( \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \).

Thus, the total time it took James to reach the store is \(\boxed{1}\) hour."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times 0.80 \text{ dollars per banana} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost for 10 bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars per bunch} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is the difference between the two costs:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. Therefore, the growth rate per year is:

\[
\frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, we use this growth rate to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years. We multiply the annual growth rate by 13 years:

\[
2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Trekking bikes: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150 \)
   - BMX bikes: \( 15\% \times 300 = 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
   - MTB bikes: \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \)

2. **Determine the price of each type of bike:**
   - MTB: $500
   - BMX: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 500 = 250 \)
   - Trekking: $450

3. **Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Earnings from MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \)
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)

4. **Sum the total earnings:**
   \[
   52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250

"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour day, we need to calculate the number of bales produced and the number of bales picked up by the truck.

1. Calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer in 6 hours:
   \[
   \text{Bales produced} = 5 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{bales}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:
   \[
   \text{Bales picked up} = 3 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 18 \, \text{bales}
   \]

3. Determine the number of bales left in the field by subtracting the number of bales picked up from the number of bales produced:
   \[
   \text{Bales left} = 30 \, \text{bales} - 18 \, \text{bales} = 12 \, \text{bales}
   \]

Thus, the number of bales of hay left in the field is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays. He has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

The total time spent in classes each weekday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time he spends on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on these days. Therefore, the extra learning time per day is:
\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:
\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent in classes during the weekdays and the extra learning time on the weekend to get the total weekly learning time:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial drop height is:
   \[
   3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
   \[
   72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
   \[
   48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:
\[
\boxed{32 \text{ feet}}
\]"
"Let's break down the heights of each child step by step.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert the height of the first child to inches:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
   \[
   72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:

So, the height of the fourth child is \(\boxed{72}\) inches."
"To determine how much the orchard earned from selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bags sold.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the price per bag.

First, we find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples by 10:
\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples per bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x}{2} \right) = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

\[
\boxed{1080}

"First, let's calculate the area of each wall.

The north and south walls are both 10 feet by 8 feet. Therefore, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are both 5 feet by 8 feet. Therefore, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together, the total area to be painted is:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial state of the sodas:
- Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
- She shakes 3 of them.
- She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
- Out of the 11 sodas, 3 are shaken and 2 are unshaken (since she took 1 unshaken one).

Next, Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas:
- After Ellen's brother takes his sodas, the remaining sodas are:
  - Shaken sodas: \(3 - 1 = 2\)
  - Unshaken sodas: \(2 - 2 = 0\)

Now, we need to find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can. Since there are no unshaken sodas left, the only sodas available are the 2 shaken ones.

The total number of sodas left is 2 (both shaken). The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{2} = 1
\]

Expressing this probability as a percentage:
\[
1 \times 100\% = 100\%
\]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(\boxed{100\%}\)."
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. **Determine the speed of each train:**
   - The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
   - The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:**
   - Distance traveled by the first train:
     \[
     60 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Distance traveled by the second train:
     \[
     30 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Sum the distances to find the total distance between the two trains:**
   \[
   180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, the two trains are \(\boxed{270}\) miles apart after 3 hours."
"First, let's determine the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. Adding the days from April 1st to April 19th gives us 19 more days. Therefore, the total number of days is:
\[ 31 + 19 = 50 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off, so we calculate 20% of 50:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days} \]
This means Billy works on:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ days} \]

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day, so he helps:

"To determine Jeff's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Identify Mike's age:
   Mike is 24 years old.

2. Determine Martha's age:
   Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. Therefore, we subtract 4 from Mike's age to find Martha's age.
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]

3. Determine Jeff's age:
   Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, we add 10 to Martha's age to find Jeff's age.
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, Jeff is \(\boxed{30}\) years old."
"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed at which people slide down the biggest slide is 60 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the biggest slide is given by:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed at which people slide down the second biggest slide is 80 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the second biggest slide is given by:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{second biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second biggest}}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[
\text{Difference in time} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it takes \(\boxed{2}\) minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
- He also takes 2 breaks, each 15 minutes long, which totals \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes.

So, the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 30 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, the total time spent on lunch and breaks each day is 1 hour.

Now, we need to find out how much time he spends on lunch and breaks over 5 days:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to:

"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Ahito ran is \(\boxed{16}\)."

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[
\frac{J}{5}
\]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15}
\]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{J}{15} = 6
\]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[
J = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"First, we need to determine the total population of the school. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school by \( P \).

Since 40% of the population is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can calculate the number of girls as follows:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

   \]

3. The total height of all the heels combined is:
   \[
   12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The total number of heels is:
   \[
   3 + 3 = 6
   \]

5. The average height of the heels is the total height divided by the total number of heels:

"First, let's determine the time each person spent on their chores.

1. **Amalia's chore:**
   - Mowing the lawn took Amalia 4 hours.

2. **Megan's chore:**
   - Walking the dog took Megan 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time is \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.

3. **Dior's chore:**
   - Doing laundry took Dior well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior's time is more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. For the sake of calculation, let's assume the minimum time Dior took, which is just over 8 hours. We can use 8.1 hours as a practical minimum.

Now, we sum up the time each person spent on their chores:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 + 6 + 8.1 = 18.1 \text{ hours}

"First, we need to determine the distance from John's home to his parents' home. Since it takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph, we can calculate the one-way distance using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the one-way distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John makes a round trip, the total distance for one visit is:

\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:

\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles/visit} \times 2 \, \text{visits/month} = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:

"First, let's determine how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will walk in 7 days as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let \( B \) represent the number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2 \times B \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk \(\boxed{35}\) miles in 7 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total production of the first 4 workers:**
   - The first 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each. So, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - The next 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each. So, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Therefore, the first 4 workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the total production of the first 4 workers in 10 hours:**
   - Since they work for 10 hours, the first 4 workers produce \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys in total.

3. **Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers:**
   - The manufacturer still needs 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys. This means that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

4. **Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:**
   - Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in 10 hours.
   - Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

The number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is \(\boxed{18}\)."

"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. So, Luis used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and gave the remaining \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris kept 9 of the stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. So, Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9, which means he gave \( \frac{S}{4} - 9 = 7 \) stickers to Rob. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} - 9 = 7
   \]
4. Solving the equation for \( S \):
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 7 + 9
   \]
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16
   \]
   \[
   S = 16 \times 4

2. **Determine the number of days required for Alfie to fly this distance:**
   Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**
   - The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
   - The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine the speed of the fastest car:**
   - The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is \(\boxed{750}\) miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was \(16 - 2 = 14\) years old. According to the problem, at that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. So, if we let \(v\) be Vince's age two years ago, then we have the equation:
\[14 = 2v.\]
Solving for \(v\), we get:
\[v = \frac{14}{2} = 7.\]
This means that two years ago, Vince was 7 years old. Therefore, Vince's current age is:
\[7 + 2 = 9.\]
So, Vince is now \(\boxed{9}\) years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \( A \), by Madeline as \( M \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we substitute \( C \) and \( S \) back into the total number of eggs painted:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can rewrite this as:
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know that Arnold painted 13 eggs. We need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. We do this by dividing 200 by 8:

\[
200 \div 8 = 25
\]

So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons. Since each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, he will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and there are 200 crayons:

\[
200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce per crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
\]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes:

\[
25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces per box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
\]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[
200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
\]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:

\[
400 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces per pound} = 25 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much of the tree can be used to make logs. The tree is 80 feet tall, and John can make logs out of 80% of it. So, the length of the usable part of the tree is:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable tree. This is calculated by dividing 64 by 4:
\[ 64 \div 4 = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John can cut 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:
\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

John sells each plank for $1.2. So, the total amount of money he makes from selling all the planks is:
\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000 and her brother earns $10000, so together they earn:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we find the total amount of money they all have together by adding Valerie's salary, her brother's salary, and their mother's salary:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.

1. **Determine the time spent on the beach:**
   Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. This is given directly in the problem.

2. **Determine the speed on the beach:**
   Let \( v \) be the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach in miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can calculate her speed as follows:
   \[
   v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

3. **Determine the speed on the sidewalk:**
   Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
   \[
   2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

4. **Determine the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at a speed of \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles per minute. The time spent on the sidewalk is:
   \[
   \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   The total time is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."
"First, we calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 every week for 8 weeks. Therefore, the total amount saved is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more money Jane needs to save to reach a total of $60. We subtract the amount she has already saved from $60:
\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane continues to save $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:
\[ \frac{28}{4} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane \(\boxed{7}\) more weeks to have saved a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. Calculate the number of blue birds in the 3 trees, each having 7 blue birds:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

2. Calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees, each having 4 blue birds:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

3. The number of blue birds in the 1 tree with 3 blue birds is:
   \[
   3
   \]

4. Add the results from the three parts together to get the total number of blue birds:
   \[
   21 + 8 + 3 = 32
   \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Bob originally has:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides of the equation to find the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, we need to subtract 10 from his original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Bob will have is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we need to ensure that after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into the water bottle, the resulting mixture is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into the water bottle, the resulting mixture will be a weighted average of the two temperatures. The total volume of the mixture will be 5 ounces.

The formula for the weighted average temperature \( T_{\text{avg}} \) is:
\[
T_{\text{avg}} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We need this average temperature to be at least 40 degrees:
\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):
\[
4 \times 33 = 132
\]

Substitute this into the inequality:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 5:
\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Next, solve for \( T \) by subtracting 132 from both sides:
\[
T \geq 68
\]

Thus, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after pouring the specified amounts.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over that period and then sum them with the initial number of animals.

1. **Initial number of animals:**
   - Cows: 50
   - Chickens: 20

2. **Number of days in three weeks:**
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Cows added per day:**
   \[
   20 \text{ cows/day}
   \]
   **Total cows added in 21 days:**
   \[
   20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows}
   \]

4. **Chickens added per day:**
   \[
   10 \text{ chickens/day}
   \]
   **Total chickens added in 21 days:**
   \[
   10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens}
   \]

5. **Total number of cows after three weeks:**
   \[
   50 \text{ initial cows} + 420 \text{ cows added} = 470 \text{ cows}
   \]

6. **Total number of chickens after three weeks:**
   \[
   20 \text{ initial chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens added} = 230 \text{ chickens}
   \]

7. **Total number of animals on the farm:**
   \[
   470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals}
   \]

Thus, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is \(\boxed{700}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the cost is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the total cost. So, the cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as:
     \[
     23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
     \]

2. **Find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - First, calculate 3 less than 6:
     \[
     6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes}
     \]
   - Next, calculate 1 less than 3 scoops:
     \[
     3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops}
     \]
   - Therefore, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = 1.5 \text{ potatoes per scoop}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - Since 1 scoop requires 1.5 potatoes, 18 scoops will require:
     \[
     18 \times 1.5 = 27 \text{ potatoes}
     \]

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is:
\[
\boxed{27}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, so the total number of eggs for the first period is:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days. Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for 30 days, so the total number of eggs for the second period is:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we need to find out how many jellybeans are either green or red. Adding the number of green and red jellybeans together, we get:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is the total number of jellybeans minus the number of green and red jellybeans:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects from one tree in one year.
2. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects from all trees in one year.
3. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects from all trees in a decade (10 years).

Step 1: Calculate the number of lemons from one tree in one year.
Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree each year.

Step 2: Calculate the number of lemons from all trees in one year.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day from the individual sunflowers and the bouquets.

1. **Calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:**
   - The cost of one sunflower is $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers per day.
   - Therefore, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{2} = 13
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:**
   - The cost of one bouquet is $8.
   - Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets per day.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{56}{8} = 7
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:

"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the time required for each type of scene separately and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the number of days required to draw the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.

\[
\text{Days for large-sized scenes} = \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of days required to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.

\[
\text{Days for medium-sized scenes} = \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
\]

Finally, let's calculate the number of days required to draw the small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.

\[

"To determine the probability that both of Mark's lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the probability of winning for each ticket.
2. Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners by multiplying the individual probabilities.

First, let's denote the probability of winning the first ticket as \( P_1 \). According to the problem, \( P_1 = 20\% = 0.20 \).

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket, \( P_2 \), is:
\[ P_2 = 3 \times P_1 = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Next, we need to find the probability that both tickets are winners. This is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{both tickets are winners}) = P_1 \times P_2 = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. According to the problem, Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Therefore, Carlos collected:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \text{ seashells} \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, Carrey collected:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ seashells} \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Jim, Carlos, and Carrey:
\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \text{ seashells} \]

They decided to divide all the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person will get:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ seashells} \]

"To determine how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to break down his consumption by days of the week.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - Mason eats 4 carrots each day.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Total carrots on weekdays = \( 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \).

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Mason eats 5 carrots each day.
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - Total carrots on weekends = \( 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \).

3. **Total carrots in a week:**
   - Total carrots = Carrots on weekdays + Carrots on weekends
   - Total carrots = \( 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \).

Therefore, Mason eats \(\boxed{30}\) carrots a week."
"First, let's determine the length of the second song. The first song is 5 minutes long, and the second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is calculated as:
\[ 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the length of the second song is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total length of the cassette:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To determine Linus's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the selling price of one mobile device:**
   - Linus buys a mobile device for $20.
   - He sells it for twice the original price.
   - Therefore, the selling price is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the devices bought last Monday:**
   - Linus bought 2 devices last Monday.
   - The cost per device is $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for Monday is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the devices bought last Tuesday:**
   - Linus bought 4 devices last Tuesday.
   - The cost per device is $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for Tuesday is \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total cost of all devices bought:**
   - The total cost for Monday and Tuesday is \( 40 + 80 = 120 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all devices:**
   - Linus sold 2 devices from Monday and 4 devices from Tuesday, making a total of \( 2 + 4 = 6 \) devices.
   - The selling price per device is $40.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is \( 6 \times 40 = 240 \) dollars.

6. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the profit is \( 240 - 120 = 120 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Ned's height:**
   - Isabel is 7 feet tall.
   - Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel.
   \[
   \text{Ned's height} = 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine Carl's height:**
   - Carl is one foot taller than Ned.
   \[
   \text{Carl's height} = 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the length of Carl's cane:**
   - Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall.
   \[
   \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the length of Carl's cane is \(\boxed{3}\) feet."
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles of juice are needed (since \( \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \)).
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \( 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \) bottles.

2. **Determine how many bottles Hortex currently produces:**
   - Hortex produces 4200 bottles of juice per day.

3. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles required is \( 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \) bottles.

Thus, Hortex would have to produce an additional \(\boxed{7300}\) bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color. Since Carla has 8 octuplets and 3/4 of them are dressed in purple and 1/4 in blue:

- Number of purple-wearing octuplets: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of blue-wearing octuplets: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows. According to the problem, all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows:

- Number of blue-wearers wearing bows: \( 2 \)
- Number of purple-wearers wearing bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

Now, we calculate the total number of octuplets wearing bows:

- Total number of bow-wearers: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)

We need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The number of purple-wearers wearing bows is 2, and the total number of bow-wearers is 4. Therefore, the probability is:

\[ \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of bow-wearers}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of tax reports received from Monday to Friday.
2. Subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total.
3. Subtract the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday from the remaining total.

First, we know the total number of tax reports received last week is 5168.

Next, we know the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907.

Then, we know the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136.

Now, we can calculate the number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports.

The calculation is as follows:

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

First, add the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday:

\[ 1907 + 2136 = 4043 \]

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of reports:

\[ 5168 - 4043 = 1125 \]

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is \(\boxed{1125}\)."
"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the area of land sold in the first transaction:**
   Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land.
   \[
   \text{Area sold first} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]

2. **Calculate the money earned from the first transaction:**
   He sold this 40 square meters for $50.
   \[
   \text{Money earned first} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining area of land after the first transaction:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining area} = 80 - 40 = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]

4. **Calculate the area of land sold in the second transaction:**
   Abraham sold a quarter of the remaining 40 square meters.
   \[
   \text{Area sold second} = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ square meters}
   \]

5. **Calculate the money earned from the second transaction:**
   He sold this 10 square meters for $30.
   \[
   \text{Money earned second} = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining area of land after the second transaction:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining area} = 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ square meters}
   \]

7. **Calculate the money earned from selling the remaining land:**
   Abraham sold the remaining 30 square meters at $3 per square meter.
   \[
   \text{Money earned third} = 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

8. **Calculate the total money earned from all transactions:**
   \[
   \text{Total money earned} = 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \text{ dollars}

"To determine Geb's age, we start by using the information given in the problem. We know that Geb's age is 10 less than half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old.

First, we calculate half of Haley's age:
\[
\frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Next, we subtract 10 from this result to find Geb's age:
\[
13 - 10 = 3
\]

Therefore, Geb is \(\boxed{3}\) years old."
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of face masks used per outing:**
   Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.

2. **Calculate the number of face masks used per day:**
   Tyrion goes out three times a day. Since he changes his face mask two times each time he goes out, the number of face masks used per day is:
   \[
   3 \text{ outings/day} \times 2 \text{ face masks/outing} = 6 \text{ face masks/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of face masks used in 2 days:**
   Since he uses 6 face masks per day, the number of face masks used in 2 days is:
   \[
   6 \text{ face masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ face masks}
   \]

Therefore, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs each person finds:
- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we sum the number of eggs found by all four people:
\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs to find out how many are still hidden:
\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so combined they have:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:
\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments in all three complexes:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:
\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:
\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **Year 5**: The tree produces 50 fruits.
2. **Year 6**: The tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **Year 7**: The tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **Year 8**: The tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. First, we need to find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits. Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. **Year 9**: The tree produces 0 fruits.
6. **Year 10**: The tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2450\]

Thus, the total number of fruits the avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and gave Jack \(\frac{1}{5}\) of her money. We calculate \(\frac{1}{5}\) of $100 as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
\]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Jack originally had $100. Adding the $20 that Sophia gave him, we get:

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R_r \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B_r \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y_r \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   R_r = 4B_r
   \]
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   B_r = Y_r - 7
   \]
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters:
   \[
   R_r + B_r + Y_r = 37
   \]

First, substitute \( R_r \) and \( B_r \) in terms of \( Y_r \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B_r \) as:
\[
B_r = Y_r - 7
\]
Then, substitute \( B_r \) into the first relationship to express \( R_r \) in terms of \( Y_r \):
\[
R_r = 4B_r = 4(Y_r - 7) = 4Y_r - 28
\]

Now, substitute \( R_r \) and \( B_r \) into the combined length equation:
\[
(4Y_r - 28) + (Y_r - 7) + Y_r = 37
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4Y_r - 28 + Y_r - 7 + Y_r = 37
\]
\[
6Y_r - 35 = 37
\]

Add 35 to both sides to isolate the term with \( Y_r \):
\[
6Y_r = 72
\]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( Y_r \):
\[
Y_r = 12
\]

Now, substitute \( Y_r = 12 \) back into the expressions for \( B_r \) and \( R_r \):
\[
B_r = Y_r - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5
\]
\[
R_r = 4B_r = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]

Thus, the length of the red rope is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with:
\[ 15 - x \]
According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
Solving for \( x \), we subtract 12 from 15:
\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]
So, Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Since Ronnie gave the same amount \( x \) to their little sister, Ronnie also gave $3. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]
Thus, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used first. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:

\[
\frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
\]

This leaves the other half of the mural to be painted with red, white, and purple paint. Since the remaining half is also 6 pints, and the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can denote the amount of each of these colors as \(x\). Therefore, we have:

\[
x + x + x = 6
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x = 6
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{6}{3} = 2
\]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:
\[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
\[ 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:
\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
   \[
   \text{Monday} = 3
   \]

2. **Tuesday:**
   She sees double the number of clouds as Monday.
   \[
   \text{Tuesday} = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   She sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Wednesday} = 6 \times 2 = 12
   \]

4. **Thursday:**
   She sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday.
   \[
   \text{Thursday} = 12 \times 2 = 24
   \]

5. **Friday:**
   She sees double the number of clouds as Thursday.
   \[
   \text{Friday} = 24 \times 2 = 48
   \]

Next, we sum the number of puffs counted each day:
\[
\text{Total} = 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93

"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods. Therefore, the number of pods in the special size box is calculated as follows:

\[ 100 + 0.2 \times 100 = 100 + 20 = 120 \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \]

This means each pod in the special size box costs $0.10. Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the cost per cycle is $0.10. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per cycle:

\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples the value of the remaining bills.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday: \( 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage:**
   - The teacher conserves chalk and uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - Daily usage: \( 20\% \) of the remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the remaining chalk each day:**
   - Let \( C_n \) be the remaining chalk after \( n \) days.
   - After the first day (Tuesday):
     \[
     C_1 = 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the second day (Wednesday):
     \[
     C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \text{ inches}

"First, let's determine the number of girls and boys on varsity.

The total number of girls in the class is 12. One-third of the girls are on varsity:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
\]

The total number of boys in the class is 12. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of students not on varsity. The number of girls not on varsity is:
\[
12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity}
\]

The number of boys not on varsity is:
\[
12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity}

"Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many face masks as Mike. Since Mike bought 5 face masks, we can calculate the number of face masks Johnny bought as follows:

1. Calculate thrice the number of face masks Mike bought: \(3 \times 5 = 15\).
2. Add 2 to that number: \(15 + 2 = 17\).

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
17

"First, let's determine the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of teeth fixed by adding the number of teeth drilled and the number of teeth capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' 30 teeth this represents. We use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount had passed the expiry date.

Calculate the amount of milk that passed the expiry date:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. The company sold the milk at a cost of $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the refund for 1600 gallons is:
\[
1600 \times 3.5 = 1600 \times \frac{35}{10} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:
\[
\boxed{5600}
\]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Solve for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{40}{2} \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently \(\boxed{20}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, we can calculate the number of sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000 by dividing $27000 by $500:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Since each set contains 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400
\]

Bob distributes these 5400 books equally among 3 schools. To find out how many books each school gets, we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

Therefore, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picked up these two apples.

2. **First Action:**
   - Newton put one apple in his pocket.
   - Newton threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up these 5 apples.
   - Newton put all but one of these 5 apples in his pocket.
   - Newton threw the remaining one apple at the tree.

3. **Second Action:**
   - Newton picked up all the remaining apples, which is 1 apple (the one he didn't put in his pocket) plus the 5 apples he picked up.
   - Newton put all but one of these 6 apples in his pocket.
   - Newton threw the remaining one apple at the tree.

4. **Counting the Apples Newton Brought Home:**
   - Newton initially picked up 2 apples.
   - He put 1 apple in his pocket and threw the other into the tree, so he had 1 apple left.
   - He then picked up 5 more apples, put 4 in his pocket, and threw 1 at the tree, so he had 1 apple left.
   - He then picked up 6 more apples, put 5 in his pocket, and threw 1 at the tree, so he had 1 apple left.

Adding up all the apples Newton brought home:
- From the initial 2 apples: 2 apples.
- From the 5 apples he picked up after throwing the first apple: 1 apple.
- From the 6 apples he picked up after throwing the second apple: 1 apple.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is:
\[ 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed to deliver 850 kg of coal.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

First, we find the number of 50 kg bags required:
\[
\frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:
\[
17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of Ali's order is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of miles Sam ran this week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

First, let's calculate the miles Sam ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Sam ran 3 miles each day on these three days. Therefore, the total miles for these three days is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the miles Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday. Sam ran 5 miles each day on these two days. Therefore, the total miles for these two days is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days to find the total miles Sam ran this week:

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's calculate the net rate of snowball production. Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many snowballs melt in an hour. There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, so the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is:
\[ 2 \text{ snowballs/15 minutes} \times 4 = 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

Therefore, the net rate of snowball production is:
\[ 20 \text{ snowballs/hour} - 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We do this by dividing the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of snowball production:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take Jay \(\boxed{5}\) hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To determine Jim's current age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine John's age 20 years ago.
2. Use the information that John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago to find Jim's age 20 years ago.
3. Calculate Jim's current age by adding 20 years to his age 20 years ago.

First, we know that John is currently 28 years old. Therefore, 20 years ago, John was:
\[ 28 - 20 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim. Let \( J \) be Jim's age 20 years ago. Then:
\[ 8 = 2J \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

So, Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. Therefore, Jim's current age is:
\[ 4 + 20 = 24 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, which means her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, which means her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:
\[1 + 2 + 3 = 6\]

So, the total number of slices of apple they all ate is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **Determine the number of bandages used on the second day:**
   - On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages.
   - On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than on the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of bandages used on the second day is \(38 - 10 = 28\).

2. **Calculate the total number of bandages used in the first two days:**
   - The total number of bandages used in the first two days is \(38 + 28 = 66\).

3. **Determine the number of bandages ordered and used on the third day:**
   - On the third day, the nurses ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(0.5 \times 50 = 25\) bandages.
   - Therefore, the net increase in bandages on the third day is \(100 - 25 = 75\) bandages.

4. **Calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days:**
   - The total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days is \(66 + 75 = 141\).

5. **Determine the initial number of bandages:**
   - At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Jen works in April. Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate the total hours as follows:

\[
7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 180 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we calculate Jen's earnings from her hourly rate. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her earnings from her hourly work are:

\[
180 \text{ hours} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 270 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she is eligible for the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, we add this amount to her earnings from her hourly work:

\[
270 \text{ dollars} + 10 \text{ dollars} = 280 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Jen will receive in April is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day.

1. **Morning Entry:**
   - 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.

2. **10:00 Entry:**
   - 40 more people entered the restaurant at around 10:00.

3. **Afternoon Entry:**
   - Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch.
   - Number of people who entered at 10:00 = 40
   - Twice this number = \(2 \times 40 = 80\)

4. **Evening Entry:**
   - An additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant.
   - Number of people who entered first in the morning = 50
   - 3 times this number = \(3 \times 50 = 150\)

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant throughout the day:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (afternoon)} + 150 \text{ (evening)}

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
\[
\frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:
\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
\]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[
60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:
\[
20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

"To determine the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius over the two days, we will break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[20 + 40 = 60\]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than he did on the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day, which means he planted \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 + 50 = 80\]

Now, we add the number of trees planted on both days to find the total number of trees planted:
\[60 + 80 = 140\]

Thus, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{140}

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

2. Determine the number of remaining fish after accounting for the red-striped fish.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Sum the number of red-striped and blue-striped fish.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.**

The total number of fish is 66. One-third of these fish have red stripes:
\[
\text{Number of red-striped fish} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of remaining fish after accounting for the red-striped fish.**

Subtract the number of red-striped fish from the total number of fish:
\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.**

Five-elevenths of the remaining fish have blue stripes:
\[
\text{Number of blue-striped fish} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

**Step 4: Sum the number of red-striped and blue-striped fish.**

Add the number of red-striped fish and blue-striped fish:
\[
\text{Total number of red-striped and blue-striped fish} = 22 + 20 = 42

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had:**
   - Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each.
     \[
     2 \text{ palettes} \times 4 \text{ colors per palette} = 8 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Amy also had three makeup sets with six colors each.
     \[
     3 \text{ sets} \times 6 \text{ colors per set} = 18 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Adding these together gives the total number of colors Amy originally had.
     \[
     8 \text{ colors} + 18 \text{ colors} = 26 \text{ colors}
     \]

2. **Account for the colors stolen by her sister:**
   - Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which has 4 colors.
     \[
     26 \text{ colors} - 4 \text{ colors} = 22 \text{ colors}
     \]

3. **Account for the colors Amy uses up:**
   - Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors.
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ colors}}{2} = 3 \text{ colors}

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's two-story house. Since his house is 7 times as high as he is, and Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the house is:

\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is, so:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the height of the second floor. The total height of the house is 420 inches, and the first floor is 180 inches high, so the height of the second floor is:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

"First, we need to determine how many shells team Alphas found. Since team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells, we calculate:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

This means team Alphas found 280 shells. Next, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams after team Alphas found their shells. We subtract the number of shells found by team Alphas from the total number of shells:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Now, we need to determine how many shells team The finders found. Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

This means team The finders found 252 shells. To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells after team Alphas found theirs:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is:

"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we start by calculating the total amount of exercise needed for all four dogs combined. We know that on average, the dogs need to walk 3 miles per day. Since there are 4 dogs, the total amount of exercise needed per day is:

\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the exercise requirements for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
- The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
- The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

We add these amounts together to find the total exercise needed for the first three dogs:

\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total exercise needed for the first three dogs from the overall total exercise needed:

\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles."
"First, we need to determine the amount of the loan John received. The loan is 40% of the value of his house, which is worth $250,000. We calculate the loan amount as follows:

\[
\text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much of this loan John used to pay off his debts. He used 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts. We calculate the amount used to pay off debts as follows:

\[
\text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
\]

To find out how much money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount:

\[
\text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
\]

Thus, the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is:

\[
\boxed{40000}
\]"
"To determine how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the tunas.
2. Determine the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram.

First, let's find the total weight of the tunas:
- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
- The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

Adding these weights together:
\[
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings. The price per kilogram of tuna is $0.50. Therefore, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[
128 \text{ kilograms} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/kilogram} = 64 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas."
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's find the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines at $72. So, the selling price is:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8}
\]

To perform the multiplication:
\[
72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99
\]

So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is:
\[
\boxed{27}
\]"
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting.
   - Total water removed on the low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the medium setting.
   - Total water removed on the medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 5 days on the high setting.
   - Total water removed on the high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Finally, we sum the water removed at each setting to find the total amount of water removed from the air in the basement:

\[
3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."
"First, we need to determine the total number of water balloons Jolene and her friends started with. They filled up 10 packs of balloons, with each pack containing 30 balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons is calculated as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons left} = 288 \text{ balloons thrown} \]

Thus, the number of balloons thrown is:

\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of the second medicine in one dose.
2. Find the total amount of medicine in one dose.
3. Multiply the total amount of medicine in one dose by 8 to find the total amount for 8 doses.

First, we know that the amount of the second medicine in one dose is 3 times the amount of the first medicine. Since the first medicine is 14 mL, the second medicine is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ mL} \]

Next, we add the amounts of the two medicines to find the total amount of medicine in one dose:
\[ 14 + 42 = 56 \text{ mL} \]

Finally, we multiply the total amount of medicine in one dose by 8 to find the total amount for 8 doses:
\[ 56 \times 8 = 448 \text{ mL} \]

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:
\[ \boxed{448} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each class in both schools.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

John's class has a capacity that is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class capacity. Therefore, the capacity of one of John's classes is:
\[
\frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:
\[
2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Now, we add the capacities of both schools to find the combined capacity:
\[
120 + 30 = 150
\]

The combined capacity of both schools is:
\[
\boxed{150}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest on the $300 he borrowed.

The interest is calculated as:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount that Stephen needs to pay in the twelfth month is the total amount he needs to return minus the amount he has already paid:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. Therefore, the number of diaper changes she handles is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes/day}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \]

Since the total number of changes per day is 10 and Jordan's wife handles 5 of them, the number of diaper changes Jordan handles is:

\[ 10 \text{ changes/day} - 5 \text{ changes/day} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for packing jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864
   \]

5. **Calculate the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and Tim's estimate:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

Thus, Tim's guess was \(\boxed{36}\) jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people on the bus:**
   \[
   \text{Initial number of people} = 20
   \]

2. **Number of people entering the bus at the first stop:**
   \[
   \text{People entering at the first stop} = 40
   \]

3. **Number of people entering the bus at the second stop:**
   \[
   \text{People entering at the second stop} = \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]

4. **Total number of people on the bus after the second stop:**
   \[
   \text{Total people after second stop} = 20 + 40 + 30 = 90
   \]

5. **Number of people entering the bus at the third stop:**
   \[
   \text{People entering at the third stop} = 2 \times (90 - 20 - 40 - 30) = 2 \times 0 = 0
   \]
   However, the problem states that the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station. So, the number of people entering the bus at the third stop is:
   \[
   \text{People entering at the third stop} = 2 \times (90 - 90) = 2 \times 0 = 0
   \]
   But since the number of passengers doubled, it means the number of people entering the bus at the third stop is:
   \[
   \text{People entering at the third stop} = 2 \times (90 - 90) = 2 \times 0 = 0
   \]
   But since the number of passengers doubled, it means the number of people entering the bus at the third stop is:
   \[
   \text{People entering at the third stop} = 2 \times (90 - 90) = 2 \times 0 = 0
   \]
   But since the number of passengers doubled, it means the number of people entering the bus at the third stop is:
   \[
   \text{People entering at the third stop} = 2 \times (90 - 90) = 2 \times 0 = 0
   \]

6. **Total number of people on the bus after the third stop:**
   \[
   \text{Total people after third stop} = 90 + 0 = 90
   \]

7. **Number of remaining spaces on the bus:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining spaces} = 200 - 90 = 110
   \]

The total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[
\boxed{110}

"First, let's determine the cost of one visit to the museum after the increase. Initially, the cost of one visit is $2. After a 150% increase, the new cost is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{New cost} = 2 + 2 \times 1.5 = 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of visits Pauline made in the first 5 years. Since she visits the museum three times a year, the total number of visits in 5 years is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

The cost for these 15 visits is:

\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \]

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit is $5. The total number of visits in these 3 years is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

The cost for these 9 visits is:

\[ 9 \times 5 = 45 \]

Adding the costs of the visits over the 8 years, we get:

\[ 30 + 45 = 75 \]

Thus, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To determine how long it will take for all 40 students (10 students from each of the 4 grades) to try the escape room, we need to consider the number of students and the time each group gets.

1. There are 40 students in total.
2. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time.
3. Each group gets 45 minutes to try the escape room.

To find out how many groups are needed, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:
\[ \frac{40}{8} = 5 \]

Since each group takes 45 minutes, and there are 5 groups, the total time required for all students to try the escape room is:
\[ 5 \times 45 = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To determine how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John manufactured 4 wooden tables.
- Each wooden table costs $20.

\[
\text{Total cost of wooden tables} = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John manufactured 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.

\[
\text{Total cost of roof frames} = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

Now, we sum the total costs of the wooden tables and the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:

\[
\text{Total amount Ali has to pay} = 80 + 20 = 100
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet. The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as follows:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."
"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning is needed to make 80 meatballs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of ground beef needed:**
   - Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - To find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed for 80 meatballs, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:
     \[
     \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of secret seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - For 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of secret seasoning needed is:
     \[
     \text{Secret seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
     \]

\[ 175 \times 2 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, Luke should buy \(\boxed{350}\) inches of fabric."
"To determine the total cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. **Cost for the first 16 minutes:**
   - The rate for the first 16 minutes is $0.25 per minute.
   - Total cost for the first 16 minutes: \( 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \) dollars.

2. **Cost for the remaining minutes:**
   - The total call duration is 36 minutes.
   - After the first 16 minutes, the remaining time is \( 36 - 16 = 20 \) minutes.
   - The rate for the remaining 20 minutes is $0.20 per minute.
   - Total cost for the remaining 20 minutes: \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost of the call:**

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( c \). According to the problem, the number of brownies she made is \( 3c - 2 \).

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

To isolate \( c \), we first add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, the number of cupcakes Carly made is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the basic manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The cost of a basic manicure is $35, and the cost of a basic pedicure is $40. When both are done together, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

The salon offers a 20% discount on both services when both are done together. Therefore, the discount amount is:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the cost after the discount is:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, we need to add the cost of the nail art. Karen wants to add nail art to each of her fingers, which means 10 nails on each hand (since there are 10 fingers in total). The cost of nail art per nail is $3, so the total cost for nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 + 10 \times 3 = 30 + 30 = 60 \]

Adding the cost of the nail art to the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure, the total amount Karen would pay is:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

Thus, the total number of magazines Susan receives every year is \(\boxed{42}\)."
"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. Therefore, the number of paintings Shelley has can be expressed as:
\[ S = K + 8 \]

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. Therefore, the number of paintings Samantha has can be expressed as:
\[ Sa = S - 12 \]

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings. So, we can substitute \( Sa \) with 27:
\[ 27 = S - 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 27 + 12 \]
\[ S = 39 \]

Since \( S = K + 8 \), we substitute \( S \) with 39:
\[ 39 = K + 8 \]

Now, we solve for \( K \):
\[ K = 39 - 8 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has \(\boxed{31}\) paintings."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November:**
   The toy was initially priced at $40.

2. **Price Increase in December:**
   The price increased by 80% in December. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72
   \]

3. **Price Decrease in January:**
   The price decreased by 50% in January. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36
   \]

Thus, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"First, let's calculate the standard rate for lessons and the reduced rate for lessons with a veteran.

Charlie's standard rate is $80 per hour. When he gives lessons to a veteran, he reduces his rate by 25%. To find the reduced rate, we calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from the standard rate.

25% of $80 is:
\[ 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the reduced rate is:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from the 4 standard rate lessons:
\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \]

Then, we calculate the total earnings from the 2 veteran lessons:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
\[ 320 + 120 = 440 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:
\[ \boxed{440} \]"
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Sum all the scores**: Add up all the scores Sally received.
2. **Count the number of scores**: Determine how many scores there are.
3. **Divide the total sum by the number of scores**: This will give us the mean score.

Let's start with the first step:

The scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

Sum of the scores:
\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \]

Calculating the sum step-by-step:
\[ 50 + 80 = 130 \]
\[ 130 + 80 = 210 \]
\[ 210 + 60 = 270 \]
\[ 270 + 40 = 310 \]
\[ 310 + 90 = 400 \]
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \]
\[ 500 + 70 = 570 \]
\[ 570 + 60 = 630 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we count the number of scores. There are 9 scores.

Now, we divide the total sum by the number of scores to find the mean:
\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{630}{9} = 70 \]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the pomelos she originally had. 

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 20:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]
So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number of pomelos:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Eve gave away \(\boxed{15}\) pomelos."
"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 of them:
\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. First, we find 25% of 36:
\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

Subtract the 9 apples given to his sister from the remaining 36 apples:
\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:
\[
27 \times 3 = 81
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{81}

According to the problem, the number of novels Regina wrote last year (which is 9) is 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year. This can be expressed as:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation for \( x \). We can do this by isolating \( x \) on one side of the equation. First, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 9 \times 4 = 3x \]
\[ 36 = 3x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{36}{3} \]
\[ x = 12 \]

So, the number of novels Regina has written this year is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days:**
   - Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr.
   - He travels for 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day, the total time he travels is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) hours.
   - The total distance he travels is \(50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hr} = 3600 \text{ km}\).

2. **Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered:**
   - The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km.
   - The percentage of the distance Michael has covered is \(\left(\frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}}\right) \times 100\).

3. **Calculate the percentage:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{3600}{6000}\right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is \(\boxed{60\%}\)."
"First, let's determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were left after Madeline and her brother ate and used their grapes. Initially, let's denote the total number of grapes as \( G \). After Madeline and her brother used their grapes, the remaining grapes are:

\[ G - 6 - 30 = G - 36 \]

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. Therefore, the number of grapes used for the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Since the remaining grapes were all used for the pies, we can set up the following equation:

\[ G - 36 = 48 \]

To find the total number of grapes \( G \), we solve the equation:

\[ G = 48 + 36 = 84 \]

Thus, the total number of grapes at the beginning was:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To determine how many teachers were at Rydell Elementary School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of teachers at the school.
2. Subtract the number of teachers who were sick.
3. Add the number of substitute teachers who were called in.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. The total number of teachers at the school is 82.
2. The number of teachers who were sick is 13. So, the number of teachers who were not sick is:
   \[
   82 - 13 = 69
   \]
3. The number of substitute teachers called in is 9. So, the total number of teachers at school that day is:
   \[
   69 + 9 = 78
   \]

Therefore, the number of teachers at school that day is \(\boxed{78}\)."
"First, let's break down the costs Bud incurs for making macaroni and cheese each week:

1. **Cost of pasta**: $1.00 per box.
2. **Cost of cheddar cheese**: $3.00.
3. **Cost of gruyere cheese**: Twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's sum up the weekly costs:
\[
1.00 \text{ (pasta)} + 3.00 \text{ (cheddar cheese)} + 6.00 \text{ (gruyere cheese)} = 10.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total cost for one year (52 weeks) is:
\[
10.00 \text{ dollars/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 520.00 \text{ dollars/year}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:
\[
\boxed{520}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes the custodian works in a day. Since they work an 8-hour day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total number of minutes worked per day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days the custodian will need to clean all the classrooms. Since they have 5 days to clean the school, we can calculate the total number of minutes they can work in 5 days:

\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 480 \text{ minutes/day} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 1200 minutes is the total time required to clean all the classrooms, and they have 2400 minutes available over 5 days, we can calculate the average time spent cleaning per day:

\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{5 \text{ days}} = 240 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Finally, to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{minutes spent cleaning per day}}{\text{total minutes available per day}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, that is spent cleaning classrooms is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Next, we calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. Since a bookcase has one top shelf, one bottom shelf, and two middle shelves, the total capacity is:
\[15 + 20 + 2 \times 10 = 15 + 20 + 20 = 55 \text{ books}\]

Now, we need to determine how many bookcases Elly needs to hold 110 books. We do this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Since 110 divided by 55 is exactly 2, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and the cost is $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times \$2.40 \text{ per dozen} = \$12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the selling price of the eggs. Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. To find out how many eggs she has in total, we calculate:
\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times 12 \text{ eggs per dozen} = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ eggs}}{3 \text{ eggs per set}} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \text{ sets} \times \$1 \text{ per set} = \$20.00 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$20.00 - \$12.00 = \$8.00 \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Skyler has a total of 100 hats. 

First, we calculate the number of red hats:
\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Next, we find out how many hats are left after accounting for the red hats:
\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Out of these remaining hats, \( \frac{3}{5} \) are blue:
\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:
\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the number of white hats Skyler has is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one bag of beef jerky after the discount. The original price of one bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the price after the discount is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each stick of beef jerky costs. Since one bag contains 30 sticks, we divide the price of the bag by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick in dollars is $0.50. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the cost per stick of beef jerky is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To find out how many questions she needs to answer correctly, we calculate 70% of 110:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to answer 77 questions correctly to pass.

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey answered correctly on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to determine how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test. We subtract the number of questions she already answered correctly from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get \(\boxed{35}\) questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade."
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \). The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 4 to both sides:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now, we need to find the number of blueberry cubes, which is \( 5S - 4 \):

\[ 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \(\boxed{96}\)."
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of games Ara plays each year.
2. Calculate the total number of games she has played over the four years.
3. Multiply the total number of games by her average score per game to find the total points scored.

Step 1: Number of games per year
Ara plays 40 games every year.

Step 2: Total number of games over four years
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Step 3: Total points scored
Ara scores 21 points per game. Therefore, the total points scored over 160 games is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is \(\boxed{3360}\)."
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, so he dropped \(10 / 2 = 5\) marbles. This left him with \(10 - 5 = 5\) marbles. He then found 3 more marbles, so he had \(5 + 3 = 8\) marbles. However, he found that one of the marbles was actually a bead and discarded it. Therefore, he ended up with \(8 - 1 = 7\) marbles.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}

So, the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars is \(\boxed{750}\)."
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight.
   - Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of flashlights is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (personal flashlights)} + 2 \times 8 \text{ (flashlights for rooms)} = 4 + 16 = 20
     \]

2. **Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms in the house.
   - Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each.
   - Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of small candles is:
     \[
     4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ small candles per room} = 16 \text{ small candles}
     \]
   - The total number of medium candles is:
     \[
     4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ medium candles per room} = 20 \text{ medium candles}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of candles is:
     \[
     16 \text{ small candles} + 20 \text{ medium candles} = 36 \text{ candles}
     \]

3. **Total Candles and Flashlights:**
   - Adding the total number of flashlights and candles together, we get:
     \[
     20 \text{ flashlights} + 36 \text{ candles} = 56

4. **Fourth side:**
   - Time taken: \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes

5. **Fifth side:**
   - Time taken: \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes

6. **Sixth side:**
   - Time taken: \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes

Now, we sum the times for all six sides:

\[
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5
\]

First, add the times for the first three sides:

\[
5 + 10 + 10 = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, add the times for the last three sides:

\[
2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 7.5 \text{ minutes}

1. **Total Distance:**
   The total distance Phineas needs to travel to return home is 200 yards.

2. **Distance on Land and in Water:**
   Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Distance on land} = \frac{200}{2} = 100 \text{ yards}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance in water} = \frac{200}{2} = 100 \text{ yards}
   \]

3. **Time to Travel on Land:**
   Phineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute. The time to travel 100 yards on land is:
   \[

\[ \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ 7 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. Therefore, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

Since there are five phones in total and one of them is the main phone, there are 4 additional phones. The cost for the 4 additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the 4 additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."

Therefore, the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks is \(\boxed{235}\)."
"First, let's determine John's new speaking speed after training. His original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time \( t \) in minutes is given by the total number of words divided by the speaking speed:

\[ t = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, the time it would take John to speak 10 pages is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat.

1. **Initial Popping Rate:**
   - In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.

2. **Second 30 Seconds:**
   - The popping rate triples the initial rate.
   - Popping rate: \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) kernels.

3. **Third 30 Seconds:**
   - The popping rate quadruples the initial rate.
   - Popping rate: \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) kernels.

4. **Fourth 30 Seconds:**
   - The popping rate is half of the third 30 seconds.
   - Popping rate: \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) kernels.

5. **Final 30 Seconds:**
   - The popping rate is the same as the fourth 30 seconds.
   - Popping rate: 40 kernels.

6. **Residual Heat Popping:**
   - A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat.
   - Kernels popping from residual heat: \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) kernels.

7. **Total Popped Kernels:**
   - Sum of all kernels popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
     \[
     20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \text{ kernels}
     \]
   - Add the kernels popped from residual heat:
     \[
     200 + 10 = 210 \text{ kernels}
     \]

Thus, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is \(\boxed{210}\)."
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for the lemonade and then convert that into the number of lemons.

First, let's calculate the amount of lemon juice needed for the 4 gallons of lemonade for the pool party:
- Each gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
- Therefore, 4 gallons will require \(4 \times 1 = 4\) cups of lemon juice.

Next, let's calculate the amount of lemon juice needed for the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart:
- Since the extra gallon is twice as tart, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon.
- Therefore, the extra gallon will require \(2 \times 1 = 2\) cups of lemon juice.

Now, let's find the total amount of lemon juice needed:
- The total lemon juice required is \(4 + 2 = 6\) cups.

Next, we need to determine how many lemons are required to get 6 cups of lemon juice:
- Tim found that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
- Therefore, to get 6 cups of juice, he will need \(6 \times 6 = 36\) lemons.

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim will need is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for the dogs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the daily food consumption for the German Shepherds:
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is:
  \[
  3 \text{ German Shepherds} \times 5 \text{ kg/day} = 15 \text{ kg/day}
  \]

Next, calculate the daily food consumption for the Bulldogs:
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is:
  \[
  2 \text{ Bulldogs} \times 3 \text{ kg/day} = 6 \text{ kg/day}
  \]

Now, add the daily consumption of both types of dogs to find the total daily consumption:
\[
15 \text{ kg/day} + 6 \text{ kg/day} = 21 \text{ kg/day}
\]

Finally, calculate the total weekly consumption by multiplying the total daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[
21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is:
\[
\boxed{147}

"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( r \).

According to the problem, the tower is made out of:
- 4 blue blocks
- Twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) yellow blocks
- An unknown number of red blocks, which we denote as \( r \)

The total number of blocks in the tower is given as 32. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + r \text{ (red blocks)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 12 + r = 32 \]

To find \( r \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ r = 32 - 12 \]
\[ r = 20 \]

So, the number of red blocks is \(\boxed{20}\)."

   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance east} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 144 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Determine the net distance from the starting point:**
   - Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east.
   - Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
   \[
   \text{Net distance} = 144 \, \text{miles} - 90 \, \text{miles} = 54 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, Elvis is \(\boxed{54}\) miles from his house now."
"To determine the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

2. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation in the first year} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after the first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

3. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation in the second year} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after the second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

4. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation in the third year} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. Therefore, Jackie's height after the summer is:
\[ 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer. Therefore, her height before the summer was:
\[ 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of Jackie before the summer was:
\[ \boxed{67} \]"
"To determine how much money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in one day.
2. Calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the chocolate bars produced in two weeks.

Step 1: The company produces 5000 chocolate bars per day.

Step 2: There are 14 days in two weeks. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks is:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Step 3: The company sells each bar for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 70000 bars is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The store has a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

1. The cost of the first T-shirt is $8.
2. The second T-shirt is 50% off, so its cost is \( 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \) dollars.

The total cost for the T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The shoes are 40% off the original price of $40.

The discount on the shoes is:
\[ 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the sale price of the shoes is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the total cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:

"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has after 3 weeks of completing his chores. Ryan receives $6 each week, so for 3 weeks, he earns:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ryan buys ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for 4 ice cream cones is:

\[ 1.25 \times 4 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream from his total earnings, Ryan has:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Ryan wants to buy movie tickets for himself and 3 friends. Each movie ticket costs $6.50, so the total cost for 4 movie tickets is:

\[ 6.50 \times 4 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Ryan only has $13, he cannot afford to buy 4 movie tickets. We need to determine how many movie tickets he can buy with his $13. We do this by dividing $13 by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"

So, Ellen's total expenses are:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate Lani's total expenses:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100. Therefore, the cost for the bathrobes is:
\[ 100 \times 2 = 200 \]
So, Lani's total expenses are:
\[ 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, we add Ellen's and Lani's total expenses to find the combined total:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

Therefore, the total amount they spent in all is:
\[ \boxed{335} \]"

  \[
  1.5 \text{ pounds} \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$12
  \]

- **Honey cost for one jar:**
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$20
  \]

Next, we sum up the costs of all the ingredients for one jar:
\[
\$12 + \$12 + \$20 = \$44
\]

Tim sells each jar for \$50. Therefore, the profit from selling one jar is:
\[
\$50 - \$44 = \$6
\]

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
\[
\$6 \times 10 = \$60
\]

Thus, the total profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"

2. Movie tickets (for herself and her sister): $7.50 each, so for two people it's \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\)
3. Bracelet: $8.50

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total expenditure:
\[
3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00
\]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract her total expenditure from the amount given by her parents:
\[
40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00
\]

Thus, the amount of money Janet has left is:
\[
\boxed{13}

First, we calculate the number of toys in each half:
\[
\frac{12}{2} = 6
\]

Next, we calculate the earnings from the first half of the collection:
\[
6 \text{ toys} \times \$5 \text{ per toy} = \$30
\]

Then, we calculate the earnings from the second half of the collection:
\[
6 \text{ toys} \times \$7 \text{ per toy} = \$42

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes net reduction/day} \]

We need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a net rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed. Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total amount of line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed. He already has 6 feet of line, so the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy \(\boxed{594}\) feet of line."

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since each of the 7 pizzas is cut into 8 slices, we calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to find out how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
