"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after using some for breakfast and baking muffins.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
3. She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs:**
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total cost: \( 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \)

2. **Determine the new value of the house after repairs:**
   - The value of the house increased by 150%.
   - A 150% increase means the value is multiplied by 2.5 (since 100% + 150% = 250%, or 2.5 times the original value).
   - Original value of the house: $80,000
   - New value: \( 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \)

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost.
   - Profit: \( 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \)

Thus, Josh's profit is \(\boxed{70000}\)."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours.

1. **Initial Drive:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - He then drives for the next 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered in 0.5 hours = \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\).
   - He then drives for the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph.
     - Distance covered in 1.5 hours = \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance covered in the return trip = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially drove 180 miles away from home.
   - He then covered 135 miles on his return trip.
   - Distance remaining from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is \(\boxed{45}\) miles from home."
"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her pay for both her regular hours and her overtime hours.

   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours Pay:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so the number of overtime hours is 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times the first month.
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is:
     \[
     3 \times 60 = 180
     \]

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - First, calculate 30% of the second month's downloads:
     \[
     0.30 \times 180 = 54
     \]
   - Subtract this from the second month's downloads to find the third month's downloads:
     \[
     180 - 54 = 126
     \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   - Add the downloads from each month:

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: We need to find the number of years \( n \) such that the total net profit equals the initial cost of planting the tree. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:
   \[
   n \times \$7.5 = \$90
   \]
   Solving for \( n \):
   \[
   n = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12
   \]

Therefore, it will take **12 years** for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]

4. According to the problem, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the problem using the information given. Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount. This means that $19.50 is 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can express this relationship with the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, we perform the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \(\boxed{26}\)."

Thus, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{16}\) dollars on ice cream."
"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total distance of the trip: 60 miles.
2. Determine the distance to the first stop: 20 miles.
3. Determine the distance to the end of the trip from the second stop: 15 miles.

First, calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the second stop is:
\[ 40 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

The problem states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell and Allen's current ages based on the given ratio. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the total of their current ages is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x = 9\) into the expression for Allen's age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Let's break down the guesses from Gunter's friends:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these guesses. The guesses are 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we sum these numbers and divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the daily time spent on each dog:
   Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.

2. Calculate the total daily time spent on all dogs:
   John has 10 dogs, so the total daily time is \(10 \times 0.5 = 5\) hours.

3. Calculate the weekly time spent on all dogs:
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly time is \(5 \times 7 = 35\) hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of his dogs each week is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Aaron's jewels} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Raymond's jewels} + 5 \]

Substituting the number of jewels Raymond has:

\[ \text{Aaron's jewels} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. We know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So we can express this as:

\[ \text{Siobhan's jewels} = \text{Aaron's jewels} - 2 \]

Substituting the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[ \text{Siobhan's jewels} = 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, the number of jewels Siobhan has is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total money John gets from selling the lego sets:**
   - John has 13 lego sets.
   - Each lego set is sold for $15.
   - Total money from selling lego sets = \( 13 \times 15 = 195 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the video games:**
   - John buys 8 video games.
   - Each video game costs $20.
   - Total cost of video games = \( 8 \times 20 = 160 \) dollars.

3. **Determine how much money John has left after buying the video games:**
   - Total money from selling lego sets = $195.
   - Total cost of video games = $160.
   - Money left after buying video games = \( 195 - 160 = 35 \) dollars.

4. **Account for the remaining money:**
   - According to the problem, John has $5 left after buying the video games.
   - This means the remaining $35 must include the $5 left over.
   - Therefore, the $35 must be the money left after accounting for the video games and the leftover money.

5. **Determine if there are any remaining lego sets:**
   - Since John used all the money from selling the lego sets to buy the video games and has $5 left, it implies he did not have any lego sets left to sell.
   - Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is \( 0 \).

**Final Answer:**
0"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, John's running speed is \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed = 3 miles per hour.
- Skipping speed is half as fast as running speed.

Thus, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know her walking speed is four times slower than her running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in the six-hour period. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

Time spent running:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance running:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

   \]

2. **Determine the age of Brandon's iPhone:**
   - Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the throwing distance with the gemstone:**
   - Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone.
   - With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.
   - Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
     \[
     400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the safe distance from the dragon:**
   - The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet.
   - To ensure the javelin hits the dragon, Polly must stand at least 1200 feet away from the dragon.

3. **Determine the additional distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's reach:**
   - The safe distance is 1200 feet.
   - The dragon's reach is 1000 feet.
   - The additional distance outside the dragon's reach is:
     \[
     1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"First, we need to determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the initial number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces remaining} = 26 \text{ pieces taken} \]

Thus, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine the calorie content of the entire 300g bag of chips. Since the bag has 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day after you have already consumed 1800 calories out of your 2000 calorie target:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since the entire 300g bag contains 1250 calories, we can find the calorie content per gram:

\[ \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \text{ calories/gram} = \frac{25}{6} \text{ calories/gram} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \]

To find out how many grams of chips you can eat with 200 calories, we use the following calculation:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{\frac{25}{6} \text{ calories/gram}} = 200 \times \frac{6}{25} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat:

\[ \boxed{48} \text{ grams} \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the supplies:**
   - The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the total cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7
  \]
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before using any at work is the sum of the initial notes and the notes from the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes left is:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 \]

According to the problem, after using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of units in the building:**
   - The building has 15 floors.
   - Each floor contains 8 units.
   - Therefore, the total number of units is:
     \[
     15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of occupied units:**
   - 3/4 of the building is occupied.
   - Therefore, the number of occupied units is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied units:**
   - The total number of units is 120.
   - The number of occupied units is 90.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied units is:

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight that needs to be removed:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, the number of toys that need to be removed to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys."

Next, we calculate the cost of insuring the brooch, which is 10% of the total cost of materials and construction:

\[ \text{Cost of insurance} = 10\% \times \$1300 = 0.10 \times \$1300 = \$130 \]

Finally, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost of materials and construction to find the total amount Janet paid:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = \$1300 + \$130 = \$1430 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1430} \]"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the two components of her pension: the fixed annual pension and the additional 5% of the value of the pension based on her years of service.

1. **Fixed Annual Pension:**
   - Marcy gets a fixed annual pension of $50,000 per year.

2. **Additional Pension Based on Years of Service:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension is $50,000.
   - 5% of $50,000 is calculated as:
     \[
     0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
     \]

3. **Total Annual Pension After 30 Years:**
   - After 30 years, she has been working for 10 years beyond the 20-year mark.
   - The additional pension for each of these 10 years is $2,500.
   - Therefore, the total additional pension is:
     \[
     10 \times 2,500 = 25,000
     \]
   - Adding the fixed annual pension and the additional pension:
     \[
     50,000 + 25,000 = 75,000

"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school sends \(5 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 10 \text{ players}\).

2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team).
   - Therefore, each school sends \(2 \text{ coaches}\).

3. Since there are 4 schools, we need to multiply the number of players and coaches per school by 4.
   - Total players: \(10 \text{ players/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 40 \text{ players}\).
   - Total coaches: \(2 \text{ coaches/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 8 \text{ coaches}\).

4. Adding the total number of players and coaches gives us the total number of people:
   - Total people: \(40 \text{ players} + 8 \text{ coaches} = 48 \text{ people}\).

Therefore, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Number of Diamonds:**
   The problem states there are 175 diamonds.

2. **Number of Rubies:**

"First, let's calculate how much water each girl got. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water, we can calculate this as follows:

\[
\text{Water each girl got} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[
\text{Total water for girls} = 4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we need to account for the water the boy got, which is 6 liters. Adding this to the water the girls got, we have:

\[
\text{Total water used} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the number of games the team won is \( 15 \).

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald combined is 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold \(\boxed{8000}\) copies."
"First, let's determine how many guests are expected to actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, this means that 3/4 of the invited guests will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests expected to attend is:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of gift bags required. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest who shows up. Therefore, the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Thus, the total amount Christina will spend is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adults and the children.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
\text{Total for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children:
- Each child will eat half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \).
- There are 5 children.

\[
\text{Total for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad needed:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Thus, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of pets each person has and then sum them up.

"Let's define the ages of the kids using variables:
- Let \( J \) be the age of Jackson.
- Let \( A \) be the age of Amy.
- Let \( C \) be the age of Corey.
- Let \( M \) be the age of James, which is given as 10.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \).
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \).
3. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( M = C - 1 \).

Since \( M = 10 \), we can substitute to find Corey's age:
\[ C = M + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11. \]

Now, using the relationship between Amy and Corey:
\[ A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9. \]

Finally, using the relationship between Amy and Jackson:
\[ A = J + 5 \implies 9 = J + 5 \implies J = 9 - 5 = 4. \]

So, Jackson is \(\boxed{4}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Since Lee now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means that Gerald can now run 10% faster than his original time. Therefore, his new time is:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is given as 60.
   - The number of cats is two times the number of dogs. Therefore, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).

3. **Determine the number of rabbit pets:**
   - The number of rabbit pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbit pets is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits. Therefore, the total number of pets is \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

The total number of students is 200. Given that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Next, we calculate the number of girls:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

We are told that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[
\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[
\text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40
\]

Thus, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"First, we need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[
\text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes in the can.

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes in one can**: Since the sauce made from one can of tomatoes is 32 ounces and this is half the volume of the tomatoes in the can, the volume of tomatoes in one can is:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. We need to find out how many cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we need to find out how many cans are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes.

4. **Determine the number of cans used**: Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, the number of cans used is:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes**: Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
- 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
- Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be calculated by adding the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes, and then subtracting the 5 cars that took an exit. This total should equal the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has before giving any away. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she already has is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, the total number of potted plants she will give away is:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we can find out how many potted plants she will have left after giving some away. She received 18 new potted plants yesterday, so the total number of potted plants she has before giving any away is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

After giving away 40 potted plants, the number of potted plants she will remain with is:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \( 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell \( 60 + 10 = 70 \) times.

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days.

**6 pages per day**"
"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by day and then sum it up.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
   - He also has a glass of water before bed.
   - Therefore, each weekday, John drinks \(3 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.
   - Over 5 weekdays, he drinks \(4 \times 5 = 20\) glasses of water.

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - On weekends, John still has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed.
   - However, he has a soda with dinner instead of water.
   - Therefore, each weekend day, John drinks \(3 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.
   - Over 2 weekend days, he drinks \(4 \times 2 = 8\) glasses of water.

3. **Total for the week:**
   - Adding the water consumption from weekdays and weekends, we get \(20 + 8 = 28\) glasses of water.

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we start by understanding the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[
\text{Time per mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to cover the entire 42 miles of the city. We do this by multiplying the time per mile by the total number of miles:
\[
\text{Total time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

To perform the multiplication:
\[
42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{420}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it will take the fog bank 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box and then calculate its inner volume. Finally, we will multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume for all 3 boxes.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
   - Inner width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
   - Inner height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Substituting the inner dimensions:
     \[
     V = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:

"Let's break down the information given and calculate the total hours Frankie spent watching TV each day.

- **Monday and Tuesday**: 1 hour each night.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Thursday**: 1 hour and a 30-minute show.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Friday**: 2 hours (two 1-hour episodes).
  \[
  2 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Total hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday**:
  \[
  2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours}

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week. Therefore, the hours he watched on Wednesday can be calculated as follows:
\[
7 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we can determine the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode:
\[
\frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes}
\]

Thus, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance to the shore:**
   Julia takes 64 seconds to reach the shore. Since it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the total distance by setting up a proportion:
   \[
   \frac{16 \text{ seconds}}{20 \text{ feet}} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{x \text{ feet}}
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{64 \text{ seconds} \times 20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet}

"Given that Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio of 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water she uses as 7x and 13x, respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we need to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, which is represented by 7x. Substituting the value of x, we get:

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

\[\boxed{42}\]"

"First, let's determine the number of vehicles that were initially at the port. The customs officer counted 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the initial number of vehicles is:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means that the number of vehicles brought in on the second day is:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \):
     \[
     L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23
     \]

2. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is:
     \[
     40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000
     \]

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming her salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her new salary is:
     \[
     30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92
     \]

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars are available. We know the total number of cars and the number of automatic and manual cars.

1. Total number of cars = 20
2. Number of automatic cars = 12
3. Number of manual cars = 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - \text{Number of automatic cars} - \text{Number of manual cars} \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

"Let's define the variables for the number of each type of bee:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B = 2Q \) into the equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700. \]
Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now that we know \( Q = 100 \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400. \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\boxed{140}\) dollars in one week."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items from the list:

- Milk: Food item (2 dollars)
- Eggs: Food item (3 dollars)
- Light bulbs: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Cups: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Roach traps: Non-food item (4 dollars)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the food items:
\[ \text{Total cost of food items} = 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items before tax:
\[ \text{Total cost of non-food items} = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there is a 10% tax on all non-food items, we calculate the tax amount:
\[ \text{Tax on non-food items} = 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Adding the tax to the total cost of non-food items gives:
\[ \text{Total cost of non-food items with tax} = 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items with tax to get the final total cost:
\[ \text{Final total cost} = 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths required. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. Therefore, for 8 clients, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is:

\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \]

And the total number of packs of cloths needed is:

\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the bleach and cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cloths costs $5. Therefore, the total cost for the bleach is:

\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \]

And the total cost for the cloths is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Adding these together gives the total expenses:

\[ 32 + 40 = 72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[ 92 - 72 = 20 \]

   - Bees returning: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: All the bees that left in the previous 12 hours (30 + 60) minus the bees that returned in the first 12 hours (15) plus the bees that left in the last 6 hours (60).

So, the total number of bees that left in the first 12 hours is:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

The number of bees that returned in the first 12 hours is:
\[ 15 \]

Therefore, the number of bees that left in the first 12 hours but did not return is:
\[ 90 - 15 = 75 \]

In the last 6 hours, all these 75 bees return to the hive, plus the 60 bees that left in the last 6 hours:
\[ 75 + 60 = 135 \]

So, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:
\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means that the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received. We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change received} \]
\[ \text{Amount given} = 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, the number of Facebook friends James has is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Steve takes less time to get home, he is the winner. The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will wait for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's calculate the number of tires Shawnda inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we sum the total number of tires inflated:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost for inflating 20 tires is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 500 cents to dollars:
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of these cookies:
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10 \text{ per cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so we need to find out how much change he receives:
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

Therefore, the change Carl receives is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's work backwards from the end to the beginning:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon stole \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate 9 fries, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate 7 fries, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate 14 fries, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the initial number of french fries in the pack was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
  - Each day, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
  - Total hours per day: \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
  - Total hours for 3 days: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
  - Each day, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
  - Total hours per day: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
  - Total hours for 2 days: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from all five days to get the total weekly hours:
\[ 9 \text{ hours (MWF)} + 8 \text{ hours (TT)} = 17 \text{ hours per week} \]

Next, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
\boxed{272}
\]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to feet since the final answer needs to be in feet.

- Each roll is 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
- Each chocolate croissant is 6 inches long, so each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Next, we calculate the total length of each type of baked good in feet:

- For the rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- For the chocolate croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- For the baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Now, we add these lengths together to find the total length of all the baked goods end to end:

\[ 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods is \(\boxed{280}\) feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly banana requirement for each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

1. **Monkeys:**
   - Monthly requirement: 200 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 200 \times 2 = 400 \) bananas

2. **Gorillas:**
   - Monthly requirement: 400 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \) bananas

3. **Baboons:**
   - Monthly requirement: 100 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 100 \times 2 = 200 \) bananas

Next, we sum the total number of bananas required for all the apes over 2 months:
\[ 400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. The football field is 100 yards long, and Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Therefore, the distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 2 \times 100 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back), and she does this 34 times. Therefore, the distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 2 \times 40 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Thus, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."

"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. When 6 more tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6. So, the number of tadpoles he can see now is:

\[ 11 + 6 = 17 \]

Then, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2. Therefore, the number of tadpoles he can see now is:

\[ 17 - 2 = 15 \]

So, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Depth on Monday**: The tank has a depth of 17 feet.

2. **Depth on Tuesday**: The tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Depth on Wednesday**: The depth of the water on Wednesday is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is **16 feet**."

**Anakin's catches:**
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total for Anakin:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

**Locsin's catches:**
- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin, so:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \]
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin, so:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin, so:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]

Total for Locsin:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

**Total number of fish caught by both:**
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( P_0 = \$20 \)
   - Rate of increase: 20% every two months

2. **Express the price increase as a multiplier:**
   - A 20% increase means the price is multiplied by \( 1 + 0.20 = 1.20 \) every two months.

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   - \( \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods} \)

4. **Calculate the price after each two-month period:**
   - The price after \( n \) periods is given by \( P_n = P_0 \times (1.20)^n \).

5. **Substitute the values:**
   - \( P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \)

6. **Compute the value:**
   - First, calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.0115
     \]
   - Then, multiply by the original price:
     \[
     P_{18} = 20 \times 10.0115 \approx 200.23

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she is purchasing and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Next, we sum these costs:
\[
1090 + 157 + 74 + 157 + 74 + 102
\]

We can add these step by step:
\[
1090 + 157 = 1247
\]
\[
1247 + 74 = 1321
\]
\[
1321 + 157 = 1478
\]
\[
1478 + 74 = 1552
\]
\[
1552 + 102 = 1654
\]

The total cost of the items is €1654. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by:
\[
1654 - 1500 = 154
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[
\boxed{0}

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is \(\boxed{16}\) years old."

"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Hat Cost**: The hat costs $25.
2. **Jacket Cost**: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, the jacket costs:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Pants Cost**: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. The average is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[

3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Therefore, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Therefore, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we need to find the total age of the four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Adding these together:

"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{18000}

"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time spent on peeling and cutting each potato, and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to find the total time for peeling and cutting all of them.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time for peeling all potatoes.**
- Time to peel one potato = 1.5 minutes
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes = \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} \)
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes = \( 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ minutes} \)

**Step 2: Calculate the total time for cutting all potatoes.**
- Time to cut one potato = 5 seconds
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes = \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} \)
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes = \( 5 \times 60 = 300 \text{ seconds} \)

**Step 3: Convert the total cutting time from seconds to minutes.**
- 300 seconds = \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ minutes} \)

**Step 4: Add the total time for peeling and cutting.**
- Total time for peeling = 90 minutes
- Total time for cutting = 5 minutes
- Total time to prep all potatoes = \( 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \)

Therefore, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[
\boxed{95 \text{ minutes}}

"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has based on the information given.

1. **Bo's crabs:**
   Bo has 40 crabs.

2. **Monic's crabs:**
   Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Monic's crabs} = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]

3. **Rani's crabs:**
   Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Rani's crabs} = 36 + 10 = 46
   \]

Next, we sum the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs:

\[
\text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs}
\]
\[
\text{Total crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46
\]

Now, we perform the addition:

\[
40 + 36 = 76
\]
\[
76 + 46 = 122

"To determine how much Lloyd earned over the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate his earnings for the first week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the first week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate his earnings for the second week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the second week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both weeks to find the total earnings:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings for the first week} + \text{Earnings for the second week} = 50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of \(\boxed{130}\) dollars for the first two weeks."

Therefore, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{160}\) red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

First, we need to find out how old Mark was two years ago. Since Jan is currently 30 years old, two years ago Jan was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years old.

According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14
\]
Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than 14, so:
\[
14 + 5 = 19
\]
This means that two years ago, Mark was 19 years old. Therefore, currently, Mark is:
\[
19 + 2 = 21
\]
Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is:
\[
21 + 2 = 23
\]

The final answer is:
\[

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race and then find the difference between these times.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time for the well-rounded team.**

Each member of the well-rounded team runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time is:
\[
4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team.**

The less well-rounded team's times are as follows:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time for the less well-rounded team is:
\[
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the difference in time between the two teams.**

The difference in time is:
\[
222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then find the difference between them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Difference in Probabilities
Now, we find the difference in probabilities:
\[ \text{Difference} = P(\text{number} > 3) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage:
\[ 0.25 \times 100\% = 25\% \]

### Final Answer

"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the compounded interest over these months.

The initial amount Mandy owes is $100. The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.02.

The formula for the amount after \( n \) months with monthly compounding interest is:
\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount after \( n \) months,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate,
- \( n \) is the number of months.

Plugging in the values:
\[ P = 100 \]
\[ r = 0.02 \]
\[ n = 3 \]

So, the amount after 3 months is:
\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.02)^3 \):
\[ (1.02)^3 = 1.061208 \]

Therefore:
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict is:
\[ \boxed{106.12} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost of the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"

     8 \text{ slices}
     \]

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
\[
14 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 31 \text{ slices}
\]

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is:
\[
\boxed{31}

"First, let's calculate the total number of blue pens Janet bought. Since each bag of blue pens contains 9 pens and she bought 6 bags, the total number of blue pens is:
\[ 6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens per bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of red pens Janet bought. Since each bag of red pens contains 6 pens and she bought 2 bags, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens per bag} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, let's find the total number of pens Janet has by adding the green pens, yellow pens, blue pens, and red pens together. Janet originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Adding the blue and red pens, we get:
\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} = 98 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of tests and the desired average:**
   - Mr. Bert gives 6 tests.
   - Brinley wants an average of 93.

2. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93:**
   \[
   \text{Total score needed} = 93 \times 6 = 558
   \]

3. **Sum the scores of the first five tests:**
   \[
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

4. **Determine the score needed on the sixth test:**
   - Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
   - The total score after including the sixth test will be \( 438 + x \).
   - Since Brinley can remove the lowest score from the first five tests, we need to consider the possible lowest scores and their impact on the average.

5. **Identify the lowest score among the first five tests:**
   - The lowest score is 71.

6. **Calculate the adjusted total score after removing the lowest score:**
   - If 71 is removed, the adjusted total score is \( 438 - 71 = 367 \).

7. **Set up the equation for the desired average:**
   \[
   \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
   \]

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   367 + x = 93 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   367 + x = 465
   \]
   \[
   x = 465 - 367
   \]
   \[
   x = 98
   \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score \(\boxed{98}\) on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93."
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- Micheal rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

The total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

The total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Micheal rode is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"First, let's determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \text{Weight of each chocolate bar} = 2 \times \text{Weight of each candied apple} \]

Given that the weight of each chocolate bar is 40g, we can find the weight of each candied apple:

\[ 40g = 2 \times \text{Weight of each candied apple} \]
\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40g}{2} = 20g \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, and each weighs 40g:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40g = 1000g \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. Joe has 80 candied apples, and each weighs 20g:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20g = 1600g \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:

\[ \boxed{2600} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we need to find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days. We do this by adding the number of cakes bought each day:

\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76
\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Express the cost of twenty dozen cups in terms of the cost of plates:**
   - The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

3. **Calculate the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Since twenty dozen cups cost $4800, the cost of one dozen cups is $4800 / 20 = $240.

4. **Calculate the cost of one cup:**
   - Since one dozen cups (12 cups) cost $240, the cost of one cup is $240 / 12 = $20.

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.

Now, let's consider the money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn.
- Each time she mows the lawn, she earns $4, so her total earnings from mowing the lawn are \(4x\) dollars.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money Sara has before she mows the lawn is \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars. To find out how much more money she needs to afford the jacket and shoes, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

This $40 is the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn. Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4x = 40 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. The number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The eggs produced by the red chickens and the white chickens can be expressed as:
- Red chickens produce \( 3r \) eggs a day.
- White chickens produce \( 5w \) eggs a day.

Since the total number of eggs collected each day is 42, we can write the equation:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, the number of red chickens is \( r = 4 \).

To verify, if \( r = 4 \), then \( w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \). The total number of eggs produced would be:
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]
This matches the given total of 42 eggs per day.

Therefore, the number of red chickens is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles/hour) into the formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers counted on the first day.
   - Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day.

2. Determine the number of customers counted on the second day.
   - The second day had 50 more customers than the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is \(100 + 50 = 150\).

3. Let the number of customers counted on the third day be \(x\).

4. According to the problem, the total number of customers over the three days is 500.
   - This can be expressed as the sum of the customers from each day: \(100 + 150 + x = 500\).

5. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   x = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   x = 250
   \]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons and in the small pool as \( S \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that currently, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

So, Lori will have to work \(\boxed{44}\) hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of flowers in the vase. We start by identifying the number of each type of flower.

1. **Number of roses**: 
   - There are 4 roses in the vase.

2. **Number of dahlias**: 
   - There are 7 more dahlias than roses.
   - Therefore, the number of dahlias is \( 4 + 7 = 11 \).

3. **Total number of flowers**:
   - To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias.
   - Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
   - Total number of flowers = \( 4 + 11 = 15 \).

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, calculate Yuri's points:
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Next, calculate Brianna's points:
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Naomi's points} = 68 \]
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = 44 \]
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 85 \]

The total points scored by the four students is 251. Therefore, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total:
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent solving puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on Sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is:
  \[
  10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one Sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 Sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on Sudoku puzzles is:
  \[
  5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:
\[
30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank to water her garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount of what was left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater she collected:

20000"
"To find the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

"To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the trip and then sum them up.

1. **Travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester:**
   - It takes 6 days to travel by bus.

2. **Travel by car from Rochester to New Jersey:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus.
   - Therefore, the travel time by car is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

3. **Total travel time:**
   - Add the time taken for both legs of the trip.
   - Total travel time = 6 days (bus) + 3 days (car) = 9 days.

Thus, the total number of days Andrew will travel is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of Pokemon card after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has after these changes:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

Now, we need to find the probability that a randomly picked card is a water type. This is given by the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest integer, we get:
\[ 33 \]

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"Let's break down the cost step by step:

1. Base burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

First, we add up all the individual costs:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract this from the total:

Therefore, the final amount Chad still owes is:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time it takes them to complete the puzzle is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of watermelons**: 120

2. **Watermelons ready for harvest after two months**: 
   - 30% of 120 watermelons are ready.
   - Calculation: \( 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \) watermelons.

3. **Remaining watermelons after two months**:
   - Total watermelons - watermelons ready for harvest = remaining watermelons.
   - Calculation: \( 120 - 36 = 84 \) watermelons.

4. **Watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks**:
   - 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \) watermelons.

5. **Remaining watermelons after harvesting**:
   - Total remaining watermelons - watermelons ready for harvest = remaining watermelons.
   - Calculation: \( 84 - 63 = 21 \) watermelons.

So, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is **21**."
"To determine the total cost Mark pays for the fleet of cars, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   The tax rate is 10%, so the tax on the cars is:
   \[
   \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
   \]

3. **Registration fees:**
   The registration fee for each car is $1,000, and there are 12 cars.
   \[
   \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000
   \]

4. **Total cost:**
   Adding the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees gives:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000

"Given that Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden, and there were 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = \(\frac{1}{2} \times\) Number of ants
Number of bugs = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25\)

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25 = 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many penguins are left sunbathing after some of them have left to swim in the ocean or go eat in the cave.

1. **Total number of penguins initially sunbathing:**
   \[
   36
   \]

2. **Number of penguins that jump in and swim in the ocean:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]

3. **Number of penguins that go inside the cave to eat their dinner:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]

4. **Total number of penguins that leave to swim or eat:**
   \[
   12 + 12 = 24
   \]

5. **Number of penguins still left sunbathing:**
   \[
   36 - 24 = 12
   \]

Thus, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tomatoes they both eat per day:

\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes they eat per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of tomatoes they eat per week is:

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes needed by the number of tomatoes each vine produces:

\[ \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

Therefore, Steve needs \(\boxed{21}\) vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed:**
   - John has 20 friends.
   - Each friend wants 4 slices.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:
     \[
     20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Determine how many slices are in each pizza:**
   - Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.

3. **Calculate the number of pizzas required:**
   - To find out how many pizzas are needed, divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
     \[
     \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

Therefore, John needs to order \(\boxed{10}\) pizzas."

"First, we need to determine the total amount of money Johnny had initially. He took his allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. So, the initial amount is:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we are told that this sum of money tripled in a year. Therefore, the amount of money after a year is:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]

So, the amount of money Johnny had after a year is:

\[
\boxed{90}

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we start by determining each of their ages based on the information given.

1. Jessa's age is given as 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa. Therefore, Joan's age is:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan. Therefore, Mary's age is:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we sum the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:
\[
23 + 25 + 20 = 68

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of students**: 1000

2. **Students who went out through exit A**:
   - 30% of 1000 students went out through exit A.
   - \( 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \) students went out through exit A.

3. **Remaining students after exit A**:
   - \( 1000 - 300 = 700 \) students remained.

4. **Students who went out through exit B**:
   - \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B.
   - \( \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \) students went out through exit B.

5. **Remaining students after exit B**:
   - \( 700 - 420 = 280 \) students remained.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

1. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).
2. According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert. Since John has 54 candies, we can write:
   \[
   2R = 54
   \]
3. Solving for \( R \):
   \[
   R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]
   So, Robert has 27 candies.
4. James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, the number of candies James has is:
   \[
   J = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
   \]
5. Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies, so the difference is:
   \[
   54 - 33 = 21
   \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora, we need to consider the books each of them reads.

1. Dolly has two books. If Dolly reads her own two books and also reads Pandora's one book, she will read a total of:
   \[
   2 \text{ (her own books)} + 1 \text{ (Pandora's book)} = 3 \text{ books}
   \]

2. Pandora has one book. If Pandora reads her own book and also reads Dolly's two books, she will read a total of:
   \[
   1 \text{ (her own book)} + 2 \text{ (Dolly's books)} = 3 \text{ books}
   \]

3. To find the total number of books read collectively by both Dolly and Pandora, we add the number of books each of them reads:
   \[
   3 \text{ (Dolly's total)} + 3 \text{ (Pandora's total)} = 6 \text{ books}

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike still has after he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals and he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he now has:

\[5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals}\]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is:

\[3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages}\]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages in a week. The total number of pages Mike writes in a week is:

\[30 \text{ pages (replies)} + 30 \text{ pages (original letters)} = 60 \text{ pages}\]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing in a week is:

\[60 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 360 \text{ minutes}\]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[360 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 6 \text{ hours}\]

So, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[\boxed{6}\]"
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes spent on these calls is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes to find out how many minutes Jason has left:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries Griffin had at each stage and how many fries Ginger gave him.

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:**
   \[
   24 \text{ fries}
   \]

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   \[
   5 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After Kyle took 5 fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19 \text{ fries}
   \]

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After Billy took 10 fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin. After receiving \( x \) fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   9 + x \text{ fries}
   \]

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is:
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x \text{ fries}
   \]

6. **Final number of fries Griffin had:**
   According to the problem, Griffin ended up with 27 fries:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin \(\boxed{20}\) fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides by 4:

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the selling price, the transfer fees, the brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount.

1. **Selling Price**: $400,000

2. **Transfer Fees**: 3% of the selling price
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

3. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of the selling price
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

4. **Remaining Loan Amount**: $250,000

Next, we calculate the total expenses:
\[
\text{Total Expenses} = \text{Transfer Fees} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Remaining Loan Amount}
\]
\[
\text{Total Expenses} = 12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000
\]

Finally, we calculate the net proceeds by subtracting the total expenses from the selling price:
\[
\text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Expenses}
\]
\[
\text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part of his memorization and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
     \[
     2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
     \[
     \frac{108}{3} = 36 \text{ lines}
     \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
     \[
     54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
     \]

4. **Total Lines:**
   - Sum the lines from the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene.
     \[
     54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \text{ lines}
     \]

Thus, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is \(\boxed{138}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the small holes:

- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30

Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the large holes:

- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15

Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, let's add the total time for both small and large holes:

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:

Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be \(20 + 20 = 40\).

**Final Answer:**
40"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Sam is 6 years old."
"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- Therefore, the total cost for the popsicles is \( 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream bars is \( 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the total cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
- Total cost = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is \(\boxed{7}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas.

The total number of spots on all the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots on all the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

1. Calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week.
2. Sum the total number of stories written by each person over the two weeks.
3. Add the totals for all three individuals to get the overall total.

First, let's determine the number of stories each person wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that number in the second week:
  \[
  20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ stories}
  \]
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that number in the second week:
  \[
  40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ stories}
  \]
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that number in the second week:
  \[
  60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ stories}
  \]

Next, we sum the total number of stories written by each person over the two weeks:
- Alani's total:
  \[
  20 + 40 = 60 \text{ stories}
  \]
- Braylen's total:
  \[
  40 + 80 = 120 \text{ stories}
  \]
- Margot's total:
  \[
  60 + 120 = 180 \text{ stories}
  \]

Finally, we add the totals for all three individuals to get the overall total number of stories:

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars used in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

The flag has:
- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the non-5-star rows:
\[24 + 12 = 36\]

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. Therefore, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
\[\frac{40}{5} = 8\]

Thus, the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, with each truck carrying a maximum of 2000 pounds, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of trucks needed:**
   Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks}
   \]

Since the division results in a whole number, no additional trucks are needed.

"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The formula to calculate time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at 30 miles per hour and the distance is the same (480 miles), we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together. Let \( M \) be the total number of medals given out. Then:

\[ M = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ bars per packet} = 40 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars per adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Subtract the number of bars the adults get from the total number of bars to find out how many bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we need to distribute these 16 bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bars per child} \]

So, each child will get:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes because Susan's earnings are calculated in 10-minute intervals:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Susan earns for the online task is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Points After 3 Rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.
   - Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim's total remains 18 points.
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike's total points: 22
   - Jim's total points: 18
   - Tony's total points: 43

Adding these together, the total points for all three players is:
\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{83}

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily rice consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner).
   - Therefore, each person consumes \(0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day}\).
   - For 5 people, the total daily consumption is \(0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 2 \, \text{kg/day}\).

2. **Calculate the total weekly rice consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly consumption is \(2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week}\).

3. **Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - The total amount of rice is 42 kg.
   - The weekly consumption is 14 kg.
   - Therefore, the number of weeks the rice will last is \(\frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}\).

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Monday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Tuesday: 15 crates.
- Wednesday: 12 crates.
- Thursday: 18 crates.
- Friday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Saturday: 20 crates.
- Sunday: 20 crates.

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Sunday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 + 20 = 85 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 85 = 35 \]

So, Sam was off by \(\boxed{35}\) crates from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sequence of bids and sum them up.

1. **Initial Bid:**
   - Carmen starts with the opening bid of $200.

2. **Bids by Other Participants:**
   - Each of the 3 other participants bids once, and each bid increases by $50 from the previous bid.
   - The first bid by another participant: \(200 + 50 = 250\)
   - The second bid by another participant: \(250 + 50 = 300\)
   - The third bid by another participant: \(300 + 50 = 350\)

3. **Carmen's Bids:**
   - Carmen bids after each of the 3 other participants, and each of her bids is $50 more than the previous bid.
   - Carmen's first bid: \(350 + 50 = 400\)
   - Carmen's second bid: \(400 + 50 = 450\)
   - Carmen's third bid: \(450 + 50 = 500\)

4. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of all the bids made by Carmen and the other participants.
   - Sum of the bids: \(200 + 250 + 300 + 350 + 400 + 450 + 500\)

Let's calculate the sum step by step:
\[
200 + 250 = 450

"To determine how much John pays annually for the driving service, we need to break down the costs into several components and then sum them up.

1. **Daily Mileage and Cost:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so a round trip is \(30 \times 2 = 60\) miles.
   - He goes to work 5 days a week, so the weekly mileage is \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles.
   - He works 50 weeks a year, so the annual mileage is \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles.
   - The cost per mile is $2, so the annual cost for mileage is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

2. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the annual bonus is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

3. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Adding the annual mileage cost and the annual bonus, the total annual cost is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount John pays annually for the driving service is \(\boxed{31800}\)."

"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding and printing process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, can print four pages: the left back, the left front, the right front, and the right back.

Given that a 32-page tabloid requires four pages per piece of paper, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
\]

Thus, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{8}\)."

"Let's break down the information given and calculate the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year.

1. **Total books in the collection**: 250 books.
2. **Books sold this year**: 45 books.
3. **Books remaining unsold**: 50 books.
4. **Books sold in the first year**: twice the number of books sold this year, which is \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books.
5. **Books sold in the second year**: We need to find this value.

First, let's calculate the total number of books sold so far:
- Books sold in the first year: 90 books.
- Books sold this year: 45 books.
- Total books sold so far: \(90 + 45 = 135\) books.

Since there are currently 50 unsold books, the total number of books sold so far plus the unsold books should equal the total number of books in the collection:
\[ 135 + 50 = 185 \]
This matches the total number of books in the collection (250) minus the books that have not been sold yet (65 books).

Now, to find the number of books sold in the second year:
\[ \text{Books sold in the second year} = 135 - 90 = 45 \]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[ 45 \text{ books} \times 20 \text{ dollars/book} = 900 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{900} \]"
"First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage. Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of:

\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ hours/week} \]

At a rate of $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

\[ 50 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of weeks in April. April typically has 4 weeks. Therefore, Watson's total earnings for April are:

\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$3200 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3200} \]"
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

First, calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16 of them, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

This means that after the morning sales, the number of loaves left is:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Next, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon (and also in the evening) is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Therefore, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, which is the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks.

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, and Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds (the same as Joey in one week), we can calculate the total weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

So, it will take Sandy 8 weeks to lose 8 pounds. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:

- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Now, let's calculate the savings on the milk:

- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5

Next, we calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:

- Total savings on ice cream: 2 tubs * $2/tub = $4
- Total savings on milk: 4 packets * $0.5/packet = $2

Finally, we add the savings from both items:

- Total savings: $4 (ice cream) + $2 (milk) = $6

**Final numerical answer:**

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is calculated by dividing 15 by 3:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is calculated by dividing 15 by 5:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8
     \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"Let's break down the expenses step by step:

1. **Cost of business suits:**
   Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
   \[
   6 \times 100 = 600
   \]

2. **Cost of suitcases:**
   Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150
   \]

3. **Cost of the flight ticket:**
   The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100.
   \[
   5 \times 100 + 700 = 500 + 700 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total expenses so far:**
   Adding up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket.
   \[
   600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950
   \]

5. **Amount Theo wants to save:**
   Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip.

6. **Total amount Theo has:**
   Theo has $6000 initially.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago, so his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20, so the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. According to the problem, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of those 8 people had previous commitments. So, the number of people with previous commitments is:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2
\]

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, to find out how many people actually showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\[
24 - 10 = 14
\]

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. He added these 20 marbles to a store that already had 50 marbles.
3. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8\) marbles.
4. Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Solomon has. This is the sum of the marbles he originally had, the marbles he bought, and the marbles his father gave him:
   \[
   50 + 20 + 8 = 78
   \]
5. Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:

"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = 26 \]

Since the number of loose pencils is 2, the number of pencils in the boxes is:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Jam has 26 pencils in total. Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total pencils} = \text{Pencils Jam has} + \text{Pencils Meg has} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold the same number of pencils as the boxes Jam originally had (which is 24 pencils per box), we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{24} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the weakening effect of the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Therefore, the number of ice cubes required is:
\[
\frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
\]

Next, we need to determine the weakening effect of these 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening effect from the ice cubes is:
\[
5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
\]

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening effect from the cream is:
\[
15 \text{ milliliters}
\]

To find the total weakening effect, we add the weakening effect from the ice cubes and the cream:
\[
60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
\]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the trade ratio and the outcome of the trades.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records given up} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Next, we need to find the number of senior programmers. Since the total number of employees is 100 and there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

We know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. Therefore, the monthly payment to each senior programmer is:

\[
2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

The total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[
\boxed{224000}

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the percentage of charge needed to fully charge the phone.
2. Determine the time required to charge that percentage based on the given rate.

First, the phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which is a difference of:
\[ 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

Next, we know the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to find out how many 3-minute intervals are needed to charge 40 percentage points, we calculate:
\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs each person ate:

1. Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
2. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(3 \times 2 = 6\) hot dogs.
3. John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(\frac{6}{2} = 3\) hot dogs.

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke:

John ate 3 hot dogs, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs. The difference is \(3 - 2 = 1\).

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Since the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the larger groups, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students in the class is 200, and the class is split into three groups. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) be the number of cows and \( H \) be the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

1. \( C + H = 60 \)
2. \( H = 2C \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to find the number of cows:

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Josh starts by juggling 3 balls.
2. Each week, he adds 1 ball to his juggling act.
3. The talent show is 4 weeks from when he starts practicing.

So, after 4 weeks, the number of balls he can juggle is:
\[ 3 \text{ balls} + 4 \text{ weeks} \times 1 \text{ ball/week} = 7 \text{ balls} \]

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. Out of these 3 dropped balls, 2 are caught and 1 is lost.

Therefore, the number of balls he has left to juggle is:
\[ 7 \text{ balls} - 3 \text{ balls} = 4 \text{ balls} \]

So, the final number of balls Josh starts juggling on stage is:
\[ 4 \text{ balls} \]

Final numerical answer:
4"
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad. Therefore, the blue beetle and the green toad each weigh 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Therefore, the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. Therefore, the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself. The weights of the animals are:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is:
\[50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 \text{ pounds}\]

Adding the weight of the container, which is 20 pounds, the total weight is:
\[240 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds}\]

Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is \(\boxed{260}\)."
"To determine the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we need to add up all the outfits she received.

1. Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.
2. At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits that her friend gave her. Therefore, she received \(2 \times 24 = 48\) new baby outfits.
3. Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

Now, we add all these amounts together:
\[ 24 + 48 + 15 \]

First, add 24 and 48:
\[ 24 + 48 = 72 \]

Next, add 15 to the result:
\[ 72 + 15 = 87 \]

"First, let's determine how many meters Tyson would run each day if he followed his coach's advice. Tyson currently runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more meters. 

To find \( \frac{1}{5} \) of 5000 meters:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters}
\]

Adding this to the original 5000 meters:
\[
5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters}
\]

So, Tyson would run 6000 meters each day if he followed his coach's advice.

Next, we need to determine the total distance Tyson would cover in June if he trained for the entire month. June typically has 30 days.

To find the total distance for the month:
\[
6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters}

2. **Cookies for her son's lunch**: 4 cookies/day * 5 days/week = 20 cookies/week
3. **Cookies for her husband**: 1 cookie/day * 7 days/week = 7 cookies/week

Now, we sum the cookies taken by her son and her husband:
\[ 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies} \]

Finally, we subtract the total cookies taken by her son and her husband from the total cookies in the bag to find out how many cookies Jenny eats:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, Jenny eats \(\boxed{9}\) cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount:

\[ \text{Cost per shirt} = \$30 \]
\[ \text{Number of shirts} = 2 \]
\[ \text{Total cost without discount} = 30 \times 2 = \$60 \]

Next, we calculate the discount amount:

\[ \text{Discount percentage} = 40\% \]
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 60 \times \frac{40}{100} = 60 \times 0.40 = \$24 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Davos paid:

\[ \text{Total cost with discount} = 60 - 24 = \$36 \]

So, the final amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To determine the percentage increase in daily earnings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily earnings from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from silos.
3. Determine the increase in daily earnings.
4. Calculate the percentage increase.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily earnings from tractors.**

The factory sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor.
\[
\text{Daily earnings from tractors} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings from silos.**

The factory now sells 5 silos a day and makes $220 per silo.
\[
\text{Daily earnings from silos} = 5 \times 220 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the increase in daily earnings.**

\[
\text{Increase in daily earnings} = \text{Daily earnings from silos} - \text{Daily earnings from tractors} = 1100 - 1000 = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase.**

\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in daily earnings}}{\text{Daily earnings from tractors}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
\]

The factory is making 10% more per day now.

\[
\boxed{10\%}

"To determine how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

1. **Calculate the monthly cost of food:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Monthly cost of food = $25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month.

2. **Treats cost $20 per month.**

3. **Medicine costs $100 per month.**

4. **Calculate the total monthly cost:**
   - Total monthly cost = Cost of food + Cost of treats + Cost of medicine
   - Total monthly cost = $100 + $20 + $100 = $220.

5. **Calculate the annual cost:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Annual cost = Total monthly cost * 12 months/year
   - Annual cost = $220/month * 12 months/year = $2640.

Therefore, Madeline spends \(\boxed{2640}\) dollars on her dog per year."

"First, let's break down the time John spent on each activity:

1. **Boating**: John spends 6 hours boating.
2. **Swimming**: He spends half the time he spends boating swimming, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.
3. **Watching Shows**: He watches 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so he spends \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours watching shows.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we will subtract this total from her budget to find out how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of mini-golf} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[

4. **Cost for Morgan herself:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Morgan} = \$25
   \]

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Morgan and friends} = \text{Cost for Morgan} + \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for each friend (excluding arcade tokens, as Morgan already has $5 for herself):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for each friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost for each friend}} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4

"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. Therefore, the total cost of lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa has left after buying the lollipops each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the amount she saves each day is:

\[ \$5 - \$1 = \$4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she will save:

\[ \$4 \text{ per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = \$20 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after 5 days is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Billy has after buying the candy:**
   - Billy starts with $10.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy he buys.
   - The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the cost of \( x \) pounds of candy is \( 1.5x \) dollars.
   - After buying the candy, the amount of money left is \( 10 - 1.5x \).

2. **Calculate the amount of money spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy takes half of his remaining money to buy gumballs.
   - He spends this money on gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05.
   - He buys 40 gumballs, so the total cost of the gumballs is \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, half of his remaining money is $2, which means his remaining money is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.
   - So, \( 10 - 1.5x = 4 \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   10 - 1.5x = 4
   \]
   \[
   10 - 4 = 1.5x
   \]
   \[
   6 = 1.5x

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is \(\boxed{25}\) years old."
"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it takes to reach 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the train needs service every 20 days.

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many points Erin has now.
2. Calculate how many points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points.

First, we know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Sara has scored 8 points. Therefore, Erin's current points can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points. If Erin now has 24 points and she scored 14 points to get to this total, then her points before scoring the 14 points were:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of points Erin had before is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - Additional cost for etching each frame is 20% of $20.
   - Etching cost per frame = \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Total cost per frame = \( 20 + 4 = 24 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for 44 seniors = \( 44 \times 24 = 1056 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - Total cost for pins = \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers = \( \frac{44}{4} = 11 \).
   - Each officer receives a cord that costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = \( 11 \times 12 = 132 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Sum of all costs = Cost of picture frames + Cost of pins + Cost of cords.
   - Total cost = \( 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1198 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1198}

"Let's break down the sales day by day and account for the returns at the end.

1. **Friday Sales:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
   - Each pair consists of 2 shoes.
   - Therefore, on Friday, the store sold \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) shoes.

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   - The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday.
   - Therefore, on Saturday, the store sold \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.
   - Converting pairs to individual shoes, the store sold \( 28 \times 2 = 56 \) shoes.

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   - The store sold one-half the amount of shoes sold on Saturday.
   - Therefore, on Sunday, the store sold \( \frac{56}{2} = 28 \) pairs.
   - Converting pairs to individual shoes, the store sold \( 28 \times 2 = 56 \) shoes.

4. **Returns:**
   - Six pairs of shoes were returned on the last day.
   - Each pair consists of 2 shoes.
   - Therefore, 6 pairs returned means \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) shoes were returned.

5. **Total Shoes Sold:**
   - Summing up the shoes sold over the three days: \( 28 + 56 + 56 = 140 \) shoes.
   - Subtracting the returned shoes: \( 140 - 12 = 128 \) shoes.

The final number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is \( \boxed{128} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Hallie spent on dance practice each week, we need to add up the hours from each day she practiced.

"First, let's determine the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total equipment is faulty, we calculate 40% of $400,000:

\[ 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

This means the faulty pieces of equipment are worth $160,000. Therefore, the value of the functioning pieces of equipment is the total value minus the value of the faulty pieces:

\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

\[ \boxed{240000} \]"
"To determine how much milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Mary has 30 sheep.
2. Half of the sheep produce 1 kg of milk each day.
3. The other half of the sheep produce 2 kg of milk each day.

First, calculate the number of sheep in each group:
- Half of 30 sheep is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep.

Next, calculate the total milk produced by each group:
- The 15 sheep that produce 1 kg of milk each day will produce \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg of milk.
- The 15 sheep that produce 2 kg of milk each day will produce \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg of milk.

Finally, add the milk produced by both groups to find the total daily milk collection:
- Total milk = \( 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg} \).

Therefore, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is:
45 kg"

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest for the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months (which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year), the interest rate is:
\[ 10\% \times \frac{5}{12} = \frac{10}{100} \times \frac{5}{12} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{5}{120} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.041667 \]

The interest on the principal amount of $3,650 for five months is:
\[ 3650 \times \frac{1}{24} = \frac{3650}{24} \approx 152.0833 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:
\[ 3650 + 152.0833 = 3802.0833 \]

Since she has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:
\[ \frac{3802.0833}{5} = 760.41666 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:
\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's hiking speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

\[
\text{Distance Cho hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's hiking speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

\[
\text{Distance Chloe hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance Cho hiked} - \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km}
\]

Therefore, Cho hiked \(\boxed{67}\) kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Axel has 50 silver pesos.
- Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.

- Axel has 80 gold pesos.
- Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

- Total silver pesos: Axel's 50 silver pesos + Anna's 100 silver pesos = \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.
- Total gold pesos: Axel's 80 gold pesos + Anna's 120 gold pesos = \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together.

- Total number of pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\).

The total number of pesos they have together is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the total cost. Millie spends $18 on supplies. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ \$18 \]

The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total number of hours:
\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had is:

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26
\]

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform.

On the day of the performance, half of the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13
\]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha, who buys individual ride tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets.
- There are 9 rides.
- Each ticket costs $2.

The total number of tickets Dasha needs is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ tickets/ride} = 18 \text{ tickets} \]

The total cost for Dasha's tickets is:
\[ 18 \text{ tickets} \times \$2/\text{ticket} = \$36 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

The total cost for David's ride bracelet is:
\[ \$30 \]

Now, we compare the costs:
- Dasha's total cost: \$36

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles they have together is given as 165. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Thus, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost without the bundle discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling these services. The discount amount is:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable subscription, which is $60 per month. The savings by cancelling the cable subscription and subscribing to the bundled streaming services is:

Next, let's account for the cards she passed out and received:

1. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
2. She passed out 5 cards to her family.
3. She received 17 cards from family and friends.

The total number of cards Erica passed out is:
\[ 24 + 5 = 29 \text{ cards} \]

The net change in the number of cards she has is the number of cards she received minus the number of cards she passed out:
\[ 17 - 29 = -12 \]

So, the total number of cards Erica now has is:
\[ 50 - 29 - 12 = 9 \]

Therefore, the final number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has is:

"First, let's determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. Again, since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices given away:
\[ 4 \text{ slices (to Bill)} + 3 \text{ slices (to Mark)} = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we subtract these from the total number of slices given away:
\[ 7 \text{ slices} + 2 \text{ slices (eaten by Jenny)} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, we subtract the 9 slices from the original 12 slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 12 \text{ slices} - 9 \text{ slices} = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

\text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
\]

Now, we sum the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs:

\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168
\]

Thus, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[
\boxed{168}
\]"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine Beth's age.
2. Determine Alice's age.
3. Calculate the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages.

Given:
- Erica is 30 years old.
- Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
- Alice is 7 years older than Beth.

First, calculate Beth's age:
\[ \text{Beth's age} = \text{Erica's age} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 \]

"To determine how much the builder earns in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days the builder works in one month.
2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.
3. Calculate the total earnings based on the daily pay.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days the builder works in one month.**

The builder works 6 days every week and there are 4 weeks in a month.
\[ \text{Days worked per month} = 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.**

There are 12 months in a year.
\[ \text{Days worked per year} = 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings based on the daily pay.**

The builder earns $50 per day.
\[ \text{Total earnings per year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \times 50 \text{ dollars/day} = 14400 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, the builder earns \(\boxed{14400}\) dollars in a year."
"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy for a quadruple batch of brownies, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of flour needed:**
   - Normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour.
   - For a quadruple batch, the amount of flour needed is \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\).

2. **Calculate the total amount of milk needed:**
   - Normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk.
   - For a quadruple batch, the amount of milk needed is \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\).

3. **Determine the number of bags of flour needed:**

Therefore, Mark has to buy \(\boxed{4}\) more bags of flour than bottles of milk."
"First, let's determine the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours a day, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is the difference between the original and reduced usage:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of stripes on all the zebras.

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ stripes}
   \]

2. She also counts a zebra with 36 stripes:
   \[
   36 \text{ stripes}
   \]

3. Another zebra has half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes:
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ stripes}
   \]

Next, we sum the total number of stripes:
\[
34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \text{ stripes}
\]

Now, we count the total number of zebras:
\[
2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ zebras}
\]

To find the average number of stripes per zebra, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras:
\[
\frac{88}{4} = 22
\]

Thus, the average number of stripes per zebra is:
\[
\boxed{22}
\]"
"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   Each sandwich serves 4 people. There are 20 people in total.
   \[
   \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   \[
   \text{Total pounds of meat} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total pounds of cheese} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of meat} + \text{Total cost of cheese} = 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cannolis:**
   Allan initially has 40 cannolis.

2. **Number of Corns Initially:**
   According to the problem, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, the number of corns initially is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]

3. **Additional Cannolis:**
   Allan bought 60 more cannolis. So, the new total number of cannolis is:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]

4. **Additional Corns:**
   Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ corns}
   \]
   Therefore, the new total number of corns is:
   \[
   80 + 20 = 100 \text{ corns}
   \]

5. **Combined Total:**
   The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is:
   \[
   100 \text{ cannolis} + 100 \text{ corns} = 200
   \]

**Final Answer:**

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked \( \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \) steps.
3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.

First, let's calculate the total number of steps Elliott had taken before his jog:
- Steps from walking to and from school: 5,000
- Steps from the short walk with his friend: 1,000

Total steps before the jog: \( 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \)

Since he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps, the number of steps he had taken before his jog is:
\[ 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \]

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[ 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \]

**Final Answer:**
Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, the total time he has before he needs to leave is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, we can now determine how many minutes early he will be:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for one employee in May: \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars
   - Total payment for all employees in May: \( 600 \times 40 = 24000 \) dollars

2. **Calculate the number of employees remaining after June:**
   - Number of employees who left in June: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Number of employees in June: 30
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for one employee in June: \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means that for 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since the second pound is half off).

The cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, each costing $0.25:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, we add up all the expenses:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the final amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it is worth twice the amount of the first pack, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we find the total cost of the two packs of fireworks before the discount:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks to find the discounted price:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted price of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days:**
   Shannon eats 2 cookies per night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
   \[
   2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Convert the total number of cookies into dozens:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of madeleine cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it states that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles are expected to explode.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%

First, calculate the number of candles that are expected to explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Next, calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog:
\[ \text{Number of candles that smell like wet dog} = 5\% \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

Since the problem does not provide any information about the overlap between the two conditions (i.e., whether the 5% that smell like wet dog are a subset of the 1% that explode or not), we assume that the events are independent. However, without additional information, we cannot determine the exact overlap. If we assume the worst-case scenario where the maximum number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is the minimum of the two calculated numbers, we can use the smaller number, which is 500.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the discount price of one blouse.
2. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price.

First, let's find the discount price of one blouse. The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. This means each blouse is now 70% of its original price (since 100% - 30% = 70%).

The discount price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price. We do this by multiplying the discount price of one blouse by 4:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Apples gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
   - Let the number of apples gathered from the average trees be \( x \).

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

3. **Total apples gathered by both:**
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne: \( 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \).
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne's sister: \( 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \).
   - Combined total: \( 45 + x + 105 = 150 + x \).

4. **Given that the combined total is 500 apples:**
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 500 - 150 = 350
   \]

So, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - He traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Next day (5th day):**
   - He didn't travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the 5th day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

4. **Second week:**
   - He traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- 5th day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Thus, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we can work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"First, we determine the elevation of the comb after it fell from Stanley's pocket. Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb's elevation is:

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find the difference in elevation between Oliver and the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:

\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from the two banks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the amount of money given by the first bank.
2. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
3. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

First, the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue's total capital now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
3. After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).
4. Later, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).
5. After 18 cats ran after the mouse, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Now, we add up the costs from each period:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{256}

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Let's denote the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \) and the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \). We know:
\[ T = 28 \]
\[ J = 22 \]

The sale price of the tattered jeans is \( T - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22 \) and the sale price of the jogger jeans is \( J - 6 = 22 - 6 = 16 \).

The total amount saved is the difference between the original prices and the sale prices:
\[ (T - \text{sale price of tattered jeans}) + (J - \text{sale price of jogger jeans}) = (28 - 22) + (22 - 16) = 6 + 6 = 12 \]

However, the problem states that Cole saved a total of $6. This means the $6 saved from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans must add up to $6. Let's denote the savings from the jogger jeans as \( S_J \) and the savings from the tattered jeans as \( S_T \). We know:
\[ S_J + S_T = 6 \]
\[ S_J = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_T = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price:
\[ S_J = J - \text{sale price of jogger jeans} = 22 - 16 = 6 \]

But since the problem states that the savings from the jogger jeans is $2, the original price of the jogger jeans must be:
\[ J = 16 + 2 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the original price of the jogger jeans was compared to the original price of the tattered jeans:
\[ J - T = 18 - 28 = -10 \]

Since the problem asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, and the original price of the jogger jeans is actually $10 less than the original price of the tattered jeans, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees

3. **Minivans:**
   - Number of minivans: 10
   - Capacity per minivan: 15 employees
   - Total capacity for minivans: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) employees

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:

\[
240 \text{ (buses)} + 180 \text{ (minibusses)} + 150 \text{ (minivans)} = 570 \text{ employees}
\]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of bird feeders:**
   - Lillian builds 3 bird feeders.
   - She buys 3 bird feeders.
   - Total number of bird feeders = 3 (built) + 3 (bought) = 6.

2. **Determine the bird attraction of each type of feeder:**
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought feeder.
   - Therefore, each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

3. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:**
   - Number of homemade feeders = 3.
   - Total birds attracted by homemade feeders = 3 * 30 = 90.

4. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:**
   - Number of store-bought feeders = 3.
   - Total birds attracted by store-bought feeders = 3 * 20 = 60.

5. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by all feeders:**
   - Total birds = Birds from homemade feeders + Birds from store-bought feeders = 90 + 60 = 150.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see \(\boxed{150}\) birds in her garden each day."
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel:**
   The bagel costs $4.

2. **Cost of the soup:**
   The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. First, we calculate 25% of the bagel's cost:
   \[
   0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5
   \]

3. **Cost of the cake:**
   The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, we calculate half of the bagel's cost:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

4. **Total cost:**
   Now, we sum the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
   \[
   5 + 4 + 2 = 11
   \]

Thus, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

1. Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.
2. The money he gets from selling the cards is \( \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 \) dollars.
3. After buying the ticket for $100, he has $50 left for spending cash. Therefore, the money he gets from selling the cards minus the cost of the ticket equals $50.

We can set up the following equation based on the information provided:
\[
\frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 - 100 = 50
\]

First, simplify the left side of the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = x
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
x - 100 = 50
\]

Next, solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 50 + 100
\]
\[
x = 150
\]

Therefore, Kenny started with \(\boxed{150}\) cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each, which means \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests were supposed to have 1 hotdog each, which means \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - In total, the caterer prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Situation:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each of the 36 guests who were initially supposed to have one hotdog got one.
   - The 18 guests who were supposed to have two hotdogs each got one, and they all wanted a second one.
   - Therefore, the 18 guests who were supposed to have two hotdogs each got 18 hotdogs in total (1 each initially, and 1 each for the second one).

3. **Hotdogs Used:**
   - The 36 guests who were initially supposed to have one hotdog each got 36 hotdogs.
   - The 18 guests who were supposed to have two hotdogs each got 18 hotdogs in total.
   - So, \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs were used.

4. **Hotdogs Remaining:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 54 hotdogs were used.
   - Therefore, \( 54 - 54 = 0 \) hotdogs were left.

5. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - 36 guests got their first hotdog.
   - 18 guests got their second hotdog.
   - Therefore, \( 40 - 36 - 18 = -14 \) (This indicates an error in the initial assumption or calculation).

Revisiting the problem, we realize that the 18 guests who were supposed to have two hotdogs each only got one hotdog initially, and they all wanted a second one. This means the 18 guests who were supposed to have two hotdogs each did not get their second hotdog.

Thus, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( 18 \).

**Final Answer:**
18 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. According to the problem, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Adding 4 more letters to this half:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

So, her sister's name has 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name to find the total number of letters:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final amount for Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- Saved from allowance: $2
- Given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs:

Amount needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Amount needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we calculate how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's determine how much gasoline each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed in gallons. Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container holds:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons is equivalent to:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of money George had left after buying the chips:**
   - George spent $5 in total.
   - He had 1% of his money left after buying the chips.
   - Therefore, the amount of money he had left is \( 5 \times 0.01 = 0.05 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the amount of money George spent on the chips:**
   - The total amount spent is $5.
   - The amount left is $0.05.
   - Therefore, the amount spent on chips is \( 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of the chips:**
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, which is $0.40.
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - The total cost of the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the amount of money George spent on candy bars:**
   - The total amount spent on chips is $1.20.
   - The total amount spent is $4.95.
   - Therefore, the amount spent on candy bars is \( 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the number of candy bars George bought:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The cost of the onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for the onions is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Bernadette to be driven to the theater. According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, the drive for Bernadette will take:

\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, which means she needs to arrive 9 minutes before Wayne starts his drive. Therefore, Bernadette needs to leave 9 minutes earlier than Wayne to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before Wayne.

"First, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

The total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other. We subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
\[ 140 - 60 = 80 \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Since Marcus bakes for 3 hours, the temperature increase is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial temperature:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the number of 10-minute intervals is:

"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for James is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is \(\boxed{59}\) minutes."

So, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

1. Convert 30 minutes to hours:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

2. Calculate the distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse consumes for 16 miles. The horse eats \(\frac{1}{2}\) a bail of hay per mile.

3. Calculate the total hay consumption:
\[ \text{Hay consumption} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bale per mile} = 8 \text{ bales} \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of 8 bales of hay. Each bale costs $3.

4. Calculate the total cost of the hay:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bales} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bale} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

5. Calculate the change after buying the hay:

"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers and then subtract the cost of purchasing the case.

1. **Calculate the cost per sneaker:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of sneakers}} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from the flash sale:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} \times \text{Price per sneaker at flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} = \text{Total number of sneakers} - \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} = 48 - 17 = 31
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} \times \text{Price per sneaker to department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the costs and savings step by step.

1. **Cost of the super ticket and additional items:**
   - Super ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost of a regular ticket and additional items:**
   - Regular ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: \( P \) (unknown price)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.

"First, let's determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can find the cost per balloon by dividing the total cost by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We do this by multiplying the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = 170 \times 60 + 170 \times 5
\]

Calculating each term separately:

\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]
\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]

Adding these results together:

\[
10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

Thus, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then use the formula for average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, calculate the distance traveled at each speed:

1. For the first part of the trip:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

2. For the second part of the trip:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, calculate the total time taken:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, calculate the average speed:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

The car's average speed during the trip is \(50\) mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she is left with:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of her 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples each person eats in 30 days.
2. Add the amounts together to get the total.

First, let's calculate the number of apples each person eats in 30 days:
- Each person eats 4 apples a day.
- In 30 days, each person eats \(4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples}\).

Now, let's add the amounts together:
- Marin eats 120 apples.
- Nancy eats 120 apples.
- Together, they eat \(120 + 120 = 240 \text{ apples}\).

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of one raised bed is given by:

\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]
\[ V = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]
\[ \text{Total volume} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} \]
\[ \text{Number of bags} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1920 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. Given that there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow cards. The problem states that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by summing the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards is:

\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the forest.
2. After about twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies. These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there, so the total number of fairies became \( 50 + 25 = 75 \).
3. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of puppies.
2. Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.
3. Find the percentage of puppies with spots.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of puppies.**

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.**

Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

**Step 3: Find the percentage of puppies with spots.**

The percentage of puppies with spots is given by the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = \( 42 \times 75 = 3150 \) pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = \( 20 \times 65 = 1300 \) pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - The farmer buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
\[
3150 \text{ (hay)} + 1300 \text{ (oats)} + 48 \text{ (carrots)} + 2 \text{ (sugar cubes)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings from recycling cans and bottles, and then multiply that by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling aluminum cans:
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from cans are \(3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week}\).

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling plastic bottles:
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from bottles are \(5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week}\).

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings from both cans and bottles:
- Her total weekly earnings are \(6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week}\).

Finally, let's calculate her total earnings for a four-week month:
- Her total earnings for four weeks are \(21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}\).

Thus, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from recycling in a four-week month."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of shoes**: Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Shoes received on Monday**: He gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he gets \(5 \times 2 = 10\) shoes.
   \[
   200 + 10 = 210 \text{ shoes}
   \]

3. **Shoes received on Wednesday**: He gains 15 new pairs of shoes on Wednesday. Again, each pair consists of 2 shoes, so he gets \(15 \times 2 = 30\) shoes.
   \[
   210 + 30 = 240 \text{ shoes}
   \]

4. **Shoes received on Friday**: He gains 30 pairs of shoes on Friday. Each pair consists of 2 shoes, so he gets \(30 \times 2 = 60\) shoes.
   \[

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' length from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long. Since there are 2 remoras, their combined length is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final numerical answer is:

\]

Therefore, each child received \(\boxed{5}\) books."
"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances.

The total number of kids in the class is 32. Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to either dairy or peanuts is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Plane Tickets Cost:**
   - Each plane ticket costs $5000.
   - Since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
     \[
     5000 \times 2 = 10000
     \]

2. **Hotel Cost:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive because it is a busy weekend.
   - The increased cost per day is:
     \[
     1500 \times 0.20 = 300
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost per day for the hotel is:
     \[
     1500 + 300 = 1800
     \]
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total hotel cost is:
     \[
     1800 \times 3 = 5400
     \]

3. **Total Cost of the Trip:**
   - Adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel cost gives:

"To determine how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first calculate the total amount they have already earned. Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 83 + 91 = 174 \]

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they have already earned from their goal:

\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

Therefore, they need to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each currently has from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he agreed to give $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money he gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we start by identifying the given information and setting up the equation based on the problem statement.

1. Jillian's shoes cost $80.
2. The handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes.

Let's denote the cost of the handbag as \( H \) and the cost of the shoes as \( S \). Given that \( S = 80 \), we can express the cost of the handbag as:
\[ H = 3S - 20 \]

Substituting the value of \( S \) into the equation:
\[ H = 3 \times 80 - 20 \]

Now, perform the multiplication and subtraction:
\[ H = 240 - 20 \]
\[ H = 220 \]

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is \(\boxed{220}\)."

First, we calculate the total miles James runs in a week:
\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we know that James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he runs in a week, we divide the total miles by his speed:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours James runs in a week is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is:
     \[
     5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for all four horses:**
   - There are four horses.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for all four horses is:
     \[
     10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total oats consumption for five days:**
   - The daily consumption for all four horses is 40 pounds.
   - Therefore, the total consumption for five days is:
     \[
     40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - To find out how many bags are needed for 200 pounds, we divide the total pounds by the pounds per bag:
     \[

"To determine the cost per razor after the discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.
   - Converting this to cents, $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after the discount is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches. In a human pyramid with the given structure (4 on the bottom, 3 on top of 4, 2 on top of 3, and 1 on top of 2), the shortest cheerleader will be at the top.

The height of the human pyramid will be equal to the height of the shortest cheerleader since the pyramid's height is determined by the tallest person at the bottom layer, and the shortest person is at the top.

So, the height of the human pyramid is 60 inches.

To convert this height into feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches.

\[ \text{Height in feet} = \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours each day. Therefore, each day she walks:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked a total of 200 minutes."
"Let's denote Angela's current age as \( A \).

According to the problem, in four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. At that time, Angela will be \( A + 4 \) years old. The problem states that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, we can set up the following equation:

\[ A + 4 = 3 \times 14 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

So, Angela is currently \(\boxed{38}\) years old."
"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the cost for both the morning and afternoon rides and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning each day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives 14 mornings.

\[
\text{Total cost for morning rides} = 14 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ dollars/day} = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon each day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives 14 afternoons.

\[
\text{Total cost for afternoon rides} = 14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ dollars/day} = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 84 \text{ dollars} + 28 \text{ dollars} = 112 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we find the total number of oranges both Brianne and Ashley brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To determine how many Greek orange pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie. Since one Greek orange pie requires three oranges:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equally costly, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( n \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest

The total cost for the first venue can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total Cost}_1 = 200 + 5n \]

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (which includes food)

The total cost for the second venue can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total Cost}_2 = 25n \]

We need to find the number of guests, \( n \), for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

To solve for \( n \), we first isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]

Next, we solve for \( n \) by dividing both sides by 20:
\[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Lily as \( L \), and by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, we substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \( D = 9 \), we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total: two packs of strawberry, one pack of grape, and one pack of green apple.

We know the following:
- The cost of one pack of grape gum is $2.
- The cost of one pack of green apple gum is half the cost of one pack of grape gum, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.
- The total cost of all the gum is $7.

The total cost can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs \( \boxed{2} \) dollars."
"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood. The 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks, while the 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood}
\]
Each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, so 6 pieces will provide:
\[
6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces of 2 x 8 wood}
\]
Each piece of 2 x 8 wood provides 400 sticks, so 4 pieces will provide:
\[
4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Comparing the two options, Frederick can get more sticks by buying 2 x 8 wood. Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$4.40 \text{ per day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$4.40 \text{ per day} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20.00.

The savings from buying the weekly bus pass would be the difference between the cost without the pass and the cost with the pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to verify the number of cows in the zoo based on the information that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo would have:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to verify the number of sheep on the farm based on the information that the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm would have:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the total number of animals on the farm is:
\[ 30 + 10 = 40 \]
- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so the total number of animals in the zoo is:
\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Adding the total number of animals from both the farm and the zoo gives:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals the farm and zoo have combined is:

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times what Sophia bought:
\[ 4O = 12 \]
\[ 4P = 4 \]

We can solve these equations for \( O \) and \( P \):

1. Solving for \( O \):
\[ O = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

2. Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these quantities together:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after this purchase:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, using the relationship \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is \( \boxed{90,000} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so the total number of canvas bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for all the packs is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling 40 bags is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cookies Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Since Josh made 9 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies Kelsie made is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount of money can be calculated as follows:
\[ 4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. Therefore, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving $80 to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \]

After buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Royce to shingle the house. According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. First, we calculate double the time Rob takes:

\[ 2 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add 40 minutes to this value to find out how long it takes Royce:

\[ 240 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 280 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

The rate for one person is:
\[ \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \]

If 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be:
\[ \text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. To find out how many hours it would take, we need to convert days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[ 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 \]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin:
\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, calculate the cost of the printer:
\[
\text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700
\]

Next, determine the total cost of the computer and the printer:
\[
\text{Total cost of the computer and printer} = 1100 + 700 = 1800
\]

Subtract this total from the overall cost to find the combined cost of the 2 monitors:
\[
\text{Total cost of the 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1800 = 600
\]

Finally, calculate the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:

"To determine how much you ended up paying, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total bill including the tip.
2. Determine your share of the bill.

First, let's calculate the total bill including the tip. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill.

\[ \text{Tip} = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the total bill is:

\[ \text{Total bill} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since you want to pay an additional 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill, you will pay 120% of your half of the total bill. First, we find your half of the total bill:

\[ \text{Your half of the total bill} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Now, you pay 120% of $30:

\[ \text{Your payment} = 1.20 \times 30 = 36 \]

So, the final amount you end up paying is:

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to break down the month into its halves and understand the relationship between the savings in the first and second halves.

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the next 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings in the first half of April would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. So, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). The total savings in the second half of April would be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's total savings for the month of April should be $1125. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total savings for the month:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, the daily savings in the first half of April is $25. Since the daily savings in the second half of April is twice that of the first half, we have:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit Verna bought:

1. **Apples:**
   - Number of apples: 3
   - Cost per apple: $1.50
   - Total cost for apples: \( 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50 \)

2. **Oranges:**
   - Number of oranges: 5
   - Cost per orange: $0.80
   - Total cost for oranges: \( 5 \times 0.80 = 4.00 \)

3. **Peaches:**
   - Number of peaches: 6
   - Cost per peach: $0.75
   - Total cost for peaches: \( 6 \times 0.75 = 4.50 \)

Next, we sum the total costs of all the fruits:

\[
4.50 \text{ (apples)} + 4.00 \text{ (oranges)} + 4.50 \text{ (peaches)} = 13.00
\]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find the change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:

\[
20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
\]

Thus, the change Verna received is:

\[

Therefore, Jairus will get \(\boxed{6}\) dollars more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Cost of five notebooks: \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\)
- Cost of two pens: \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\)
- Cost of one calculator: \(1 \times \$12 = \$12.00\)
- Cost of one geometry set: \(1 \times \$10 = \$10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[
\$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00
\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$30.00 = 0.10 \times \$30.00 = \$3.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[
\$30.00 - \$3.00 = \$27.00
\]

Therefore, the final amount Daniel has to spend is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned from her sales, we need to break down the commission calculation into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the commission for the amount over $1000.

1. **Commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission amount = \( 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \) dollars.

2. **Commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - The total sales amount is $2500.
   - Amount over $1000 = \( 2500 - 1000 = 1500 \) dollars.
   - Commission rate for the amount over $1000 is 10%.
   - Commission amount = \( 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \) dollars.

3. **Total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission for the first $1000 + Commission for the amount over $1000.
   - Total commission = \( 300 + 150 = 450 \) dollars.

"First, let's determine the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water. 

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes on a warm day.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a warm day:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day. Since he swims a mile in 16 minutes on a cold day, the time for 3 miles is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a warm day and a cold day:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes \(\boxed{54}\) minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a week.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. So, his weekly earnings are calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} \]

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 2 \times 5 \times 4 = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80. We do this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. Therefore, the age of the younger son is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs one candle per year, the total number of candles required is:

\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total amount James spends on candles is:

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \). According to the problem, Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \). At that time, his age will be three times his nephew's age, which will be \( N + 7 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Then, we subtract 7 from both sides to solve for \( N \):

\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently \(\boxed{10}\) years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 per tooth.
   - Therefore, for three teeth, the total amount is:
     \[
     3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as she had given for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Since the previous three teeth each received $1.00, half of that amount is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per tooth}
     \]
   - Therefore, for two teeth, the total amount is:
     \[
     2 \times 0.50 = 1 \text{ dollar}
     \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[

"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and he has $70 to spend over 7 days, he spends:

\[
\frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
\]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends:

\[
10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[
\frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{5 \text{ dollars/action figure}} = 8 \text{ action figures}
\]

After spending $40, the remaining amount of money is:

\[

2. Determine the total number of roses Ford grows per month.
3. Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops need per month.
4. Find the difference between the roses needed and the roses Ford can supply.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses supplied per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of roses Ford grows per month. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, Ford grows:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 160 \text{ roses/month} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of roses the flower shops need per month. Since they need 65 roses per week, the total for a month is:
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 260 \text{ roses/month} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Starting Value**: The starting value of the number train is given as 20.

2. **First Operation**: We need to add half of the starting value to the starting value.
   \[
   \text{Half of the starting value} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Starting value plus half the number} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

3. **Second Operation**: Divide the result by 5.
   \[
   \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

4. **Third Operation**: Multiply the result by the starting value minus 12.
   \[
   \text{Starting value minus 12} = 20 - 12 = 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final value} = 6 \times 8 = 48
   \]

So, the final value of the number train is \(\boxed{48}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting. The actual temperature is 468 degrees when Maggie sets it to 450 degrees. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is then:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means Maggie's oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature setting would result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, accounting for the 4% error.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Since the oven is 4% too hot, the actual temperature will be 104% of the set temperature. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the durations of both movies together.

First, let's convert the durations into minutes:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is \(60 + 30 = 90\) minutes long.
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is 120 minutes, the second movie is \(120 + 5 = 125\) minutes long.

Next, we add the two durations together:
\[90 + 125 = 215\]

So, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is \(\boxed{215}\) minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to determine how much less it is compared to Herb's house. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we calculate 30% of $76,000 and subtract that from $76,000.

First, calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

Now, subtract this amount from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

So, the value of Juan's house is $53,200. Now, we add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house to find the combined value:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

Therefore, the value of the two houses combined is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. Since a dozen is 12, Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Therefore, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought: \(12 \text{ (Judy's cups)} + 40 \text{ (friend's cups)} = 52\)
- Total dishes brought: \(24 \text{ (Judy's dishes)} + 44 \text{ (friend's dishes)} = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

\[52 \text{ (cups)} + 68 \text{ (dishes)} = 120\]

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

**Jill's Hours:**

- Sunday: Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
- Total: \(4 + 3 = 7\) hours

Next, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John.

**Jill's Earnings:**
- Rate: $10 per hour
- Total hours: 3 hours
- Earnings: \(3 \times 10 = 30\) dollars

**John's Earnings:**
- Rate: $10 per hour
- Total hours: 7 hours
- Earnings: \(7 \times 10 = 70\) dollars

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

**Difference in Earnings:**
- John's earnings: 70 dollars
- Jill's earnings: 30 dollars
- Difference: \(70 - 30 = 40\) dollars

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories}\)

Next, we add the calories burned from both activities:
\[1000 \text{ calories} + 600 \text{ calories} = 1600 \text{ calories}\]

Now, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink based on the calories burned. According to the problem, she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. We can set up the following proportion to find the total amount of water needed:

\[
\frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{160000 \text{ ml} \cdot \text{calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = 800 \text{ ml}
\]

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink \(\boxed{800}\) ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, we can express the number of red and green jelly beans in terms of \( B \):

- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. So, we can write the equation:

\[
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[
3B = 4500
\]

Solving for \( B \):

\[
B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
\]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

\[
1515 - 1485 = 30
\]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"First, let's identify the three measurements of Jared's typing speed:
1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Next, we calculate the average of these three measurements. The formula for the average is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements.

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

Now, let's perform the addition in the numerator:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \text{Pounds Ruiz makes in one hour} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we first find out how many pounds Marissa makes in two hours:

\[ \text{Pounds Marissa makes in two hours} = 120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds Marissa makes in one hour by dividing 90 by 2:

\[ \text{Pounds Marissa makes in one hour} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make in 12 hours. Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes:

\[ \text{Pounds Ruiz makes in 12 hours} = 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes:

\[ \text{Pounds Marissa makes in 12 hours} = 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts together gives the total amount of chocolates they made together:

\[ \text{Total pounds of chocolates} = 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to calculate his earnings for each period separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the first four hours are:
  \[
  15 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$7.50/\text{hour}
  \]
- Over four hours, his total earnings are:
  \[
  4 \text{ hours} \times \$7.50/\text{hour} = \$30.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the next two hours are:
  \[
  10 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$6.00/\text{hour}
  \]
- Over two hours, his total earnings are:
  \[
  2 \text{ hours} \times \$6.00/\text{hour} = \$12.00

"To determine how many years before the tires need to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per mile:**
   \[
   \text{Rotations per mile} = 725
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   \[
   \text{Rotations per month} = 725 \times 400 = 290,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   \[
   \text{Rotations per year} = 290,000 \times 12 = 3,480,000
   \]

4. **Determine the number of years before the tires need to be replaced:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{3,480,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 3
   \]

Therefore, the tires will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{3}\) years."
"First, let's determine the total number of washings per pump. According to the directions, 2 pumps of shampoo provide 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would provide half of that amount:

\[
\text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
\]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per washing, we divide the total cost by the total number of washings:

\[
\text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
\]

Since we need the cost per pump in cents, we convert the cost per washing from dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[
0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 20 \text{ cents per washing}
\]

Now, we need to find the cost per pump. Since 1 pump provides 60 washings, the cost per pump is:

\[
\text{Cost per pump} = \frac{20 \text{ cents per washing}}{60 \text{ washings per pump}} = \frac{20}{60} \text{ cents} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ cents} \approx 0.3333 \text{ cents}
\]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost per pump is:

\[
\boxed{0.33}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt originally costs $25 with a 30% discount. The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts originally cost $35. Since there is no discount mentioned for the shorts, the price remains $35.

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the outfit is $52.50, which is more than the $50 Joe has, he cannot afford to buy both items. However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically or there is a mistake in the problem setup (since Joe cannot afford it with the given amount), we can still calculate how much more he would need or how much he would be short.

The amount Joe would be short is:
\[ 52.50 - 50 = 2.50 \]

But the question asks for the remaining money, which in this case would be negative:
\[ 50 - 52.50 = -2.50 \]

Since the problem setup seems to have an inconsistency (Joe cannot afford the items with the given amount), the final numerical answer for the remaining money is:
\[ \boxed{-2.50} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week:**
   - Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens:**
   - It takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.
   - Juan needs to make 28 dozen croissants.
   \[
   28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make 28 dozen croissants."
"First, we calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{\$/meter} = 29100 \, \text{\$} \]

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{\$/meter} = 95060 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, we find the difference in cost between repaving Lewis' street and Monica's street:
\[ \text{Difference in cost} = 95060 \, \text{\$} - 29100 \, \text{\$} = 65960 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the cost to repave Lewis' street is $65960 more than the cost to repave Monica's street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended Research Duration:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
     \]
   - Therefore, the research lasts for 50 months in total.

3. **Funding for the Remaining 45 Months:**
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - For the remaining 45 months, the funding per month increases by 50% each month.
   - Let's denote the funding for the \( n \)-th month after the first 5 months as \( F_n \).

4. **Calculating the Funding for Each Month:**
   - The funding for the 6th month is:
     \[
     F_1 = 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000
     \]
   - The funding for the 7th month is:
     \[
     F_2 = 150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000
     \]
   - The funding for the 8th month is:
     \[
     F_3 = 225,000 \times 1.5 = 337,500
     \]
   - This pattern continues, with each month's funding being 1.5 times the previous month's funding.

5. **Summing the Funding for the Remaining 45 Months:**
   - The funding for the \( n \)-th month after the first 5 months can be expressed as:
     \[
     F_n = 100,000 \times (1.5)^{n-1}
     \]
   - We need to sum this series from \( n = 1 \) to \( n = 45 \):
     \[
     \sum_{n=1}^{45} 100,000 \times (1.5)^{n-1}
     \]
   - This is a geometric series with the first term \( a = 100,000 \) and common ratio \( r = 1.5 \).

6. **Sum of the Geometric Series:**
   - The sum \( S \) of the first \( N \) terms of a geometric series is given by:
     \[
     S = a \frac{r^N - 1}{r - 1}
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 100,000 \), \( r = 1.5 \), and \( N = 45 \):
     \[
     S = 100,000 \frac{(1.5)^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1}
     \]
     \[
     S = 100,000 \frac{(1.5)^{45} - 1}{0.5}
     \]
     \[
     S = 200,000 \left( (1.5)^{45} - 1 \right)
     \]

7. **Calculating \( (1.5)^{45} \):**
   - Using a calculator:
     \[
     (1.5)^{45} \approx 1,162,261.467
     \]

8. **Final Sum:**
   - Substituting back:
     \[
     S \approx 200,000 \left( 1,162,261.467 - 1 \right)
     \]
     \[
     S \approx 200,000 \times 1,162,260.467
     \]
     \[
     S \approx 232,452,093.4
     \]

9. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding the initial $100,000:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 100,000 + 232,452,093.4 = 232,552,093.4
     \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is:
\[
\boxed{232,552,093.4}

"To determine the total amount of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to add up the amounts of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the amounts of meat consumed by the first three players:
\[6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Thus, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\) ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. With 1000 members, the total number of posts per day is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:
\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts in March is:
\[ 93000 \]"
"To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of water used per week.
2. Calculate the total amount of water used per year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used per year.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water used per week.**

Gary does laundry twice a week, and each load uses 20 gallons of water. Therefore, the total amount of water used per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 40 \text{ gallons/week} \]

"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it grew to \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches tall.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in a day. Since he sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, the total amount of meat he sells in a day is:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the 750 kg of meat from Bill's bull. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

After the administrators have taken their seats, the number of remaining seats is:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. Therefore, the number of seats occupied by the students is:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Thus, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

**Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s**

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

**Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h:
\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is \(\boxed{72}\) Mb per hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in that week, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Cars towed in the first three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:

"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The roller coaster requires a height of 4 feet. To find out how much more Adam needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:

\[ \text{Height needed} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the height he needs to grow into inches:

\[ \text{Height needed in inches} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches, given that he grows 2 inches per year:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, the number of years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars:**
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   For 10 cars:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total profit:**
   Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Total profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \text{ dollars}

4. **Calculate James's commission:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the total profit.
   \[
   \text{James's commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount James made is:
\[
\boxed{17500}

"First, we need to determine how many of the 100 riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so the remaining 40% must be men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, find the total price for all three jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = \text{Price of diamond jewel} + \text{Price of gold jewel} + \text{Price of silver jewel} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

The total price for all three jewels is:

   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

2. **Determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap:**
   - Distance to be covered: 75 miles
   - Relative speed: 15 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance / Relative speed = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

**Final Answer:**
5 hours"
"To determine how many fish Tommy caught, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. First, we know that Naomi caught 17 fish.
   \[
   \text{Naomi's fish} = 17
   \]

2. Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi. Therefore, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from the number of fish Naomi caught.
   \[
   \text{Darren's fish} = 17 - 6 = 11
   \]

3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Therefore, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught by adding 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.
   \[
   \text{Tommy's fish} = 11 + 3 = 14

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the classes:**
   Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60.

2. **Determine the maximum allowable cost per class:**
   The maximum allowable cost per class is $10.

3. **Calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can attend:**
   To find the maximum number of classes Manny can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit, we divide the total cost by the maximum allowable cost per class:
   \[
   \text{Maximum number of classes} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Maximum cost per class}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6
   \]

4. **Determine the number of classes Manny can miss:**
   If Manny can attend a maximum of 6 classes, the number of classes he can miss is:
   \[
   \text{Number of classes he can miss} = \text{Total number of classes} - \text{Maximum number of classes he can attend} = 10 - 6 = 4

"To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time required to dig through the soil and the time required to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time required to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
- The time to dig through the soil is given by the total distance divided by the rate: \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

Next, let's calculate the time required to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay as he does through soil, so his rate through clay is \( \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \).
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
- The time to dig through the clay is given by the total distance divided by the rate: \( \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \).

Finally, we sum the times for digging through the soil and the clay:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

We can write the following equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

To verify, we can substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( G \):
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Now, let's check the number of legs:
- Sheep: \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs
- Geese: \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) legs
- Total legs: \( 60 + 10 = 70 \)

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find 20% of $5:
\[ 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Therefore, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for the week.

The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Additionally, Roger buys a donut for $2.

The total cost for the coffee and the donut is:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought, excluding the apple pie, and then subtract this from the total amount spent.

1. Calculate the cost of the 2 bags of chips:
   \[
   2 \text{ bags} \times \$2.00 \text{ per bag} = \$4.00
   \]

4. Add the costs of the chips, fried chicken, and soda to find the total cost of these items:
   \[
   \$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00
   \]

5. Subtract the total cost of the chips, fried chicken, and soda from the total amount Gus spent to find the cost of the apple pie:
   \[
   \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
   \]

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the cooking class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. Therefore, the weekly class time is:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

The class lasts for 6 weeks, so the total class time is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total class time by the time it takes to learn one recipe:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. The rest of the teachers are math teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add together the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

If they decide to share the money equally, each person would get:

\[
\text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{120}

"First, let's determine the number of employees who are in management. Given that 20% of the 50 employees are management, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. We know that 30% of the management employees oversee the company. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

Thus, the number of employees who oversee the company is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients Svetlana needs for 16 muffins, we first calculate the amount of each ingredient required for one muffin and then multiply by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoon

Now, we calculate the total for 16 muffins:
- Flour: \( 5 \times 16 = 80 \) tablespoons
- Sugar: \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) tablespoons
- Salt: \( 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \) tablespoons

"To determine how many good days were left in the month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Good Days**: Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days.
2. **First 8 Days**: The first 8 days were all good.
3. **Second 8 Days**: The next 8 days were all bad.
4. **Third 8 Days**: The following 8 days were all neutral.
5. **Next 3 Days**: The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

Let's break down the good days:
- From the first 8 days, all 8 were good.
- From the next 3 days, 2 were good (since the sequence was good, neutral, good).

So, the total number of good days in the first 30 days is:
\[ 8 \text{ (first 8 days)} + 2 \text{ (next 3 days)} = 10 \text{ good days} \]

Since Christina had 12 good days in total over the 30 days, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 12 - 10 = 2 \]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ J = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books, so we can substitute \( J \) with 21:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find the number of books Sally has, we need to solve for \( S \). First, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has \(\boxed{9}\) books."
"First, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach this height, we subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow an additional 360 inches, we divide the required growth by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to a height of 600 inches.

\[
\boxed{12}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the total number of toys James needs.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - When he returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so the number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for 24 dogs.

3. **After Buying More Toys:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - When he returns again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he still has 24 toys but only needs enough for 21 dogs.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - The total number of toys James needs is the number of toys he has after the last purchase, which is 24.

Thus, the total number of toys James needs is \(\boxed{24}\)."

"First, let's determine Karen's hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate Karen's earnings for those 6 hours. Since she earns $20 per hour, her total earnings for two days are:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we first determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can find out how many hash browns one potato makes by dividing 36 by 6:

\[ \frac{36}{6} = 6 \]

This means that 1 potato makes 6 hash browns. Now, to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we multiply the number of hash browns one potato makes by the total number of potatoes:

\[ 96 \times 6 = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes. 

**Final Answer:**
576"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the 9 people (Jack and 8 other adults) in the elevator.

Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg, so the total weight of the 8 other adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 \, \text{kg} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight (80 kg) to this total:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by:
\[ \boxed{20 \, \text{kg}} \]"
"Let's break down the information given step by step:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. Therefore, Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. Therefore, the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. Therefore, Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, we need to find the total number of cookies they have together:
\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

So, the total number of cookies they have is:

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{80}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}
  \]
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ lawns per minute}
  \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}}{\frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}}{\frac{1}{40} \text{ lawns per minute}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times for both modes to find the total time:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:

"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they have already spent walking from the total time they have.

1. Total time available: 30 minutes
2. Time taken to walk to the library: 6 minutes
3. Time taken to walk from the library to the fire station: 13 minutes

First, we add the time spent walking to the library and from the library to the fire station:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we subtract the time already spent from the total time available:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John and Jack have \(\boxed{11}\) minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To find out how much Catherine pays in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples.
   - The cost per kilo of apples is $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     1 \text{ kilo} \times \$4/\text{kilo} = \$4
     \]

2. **Bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas.
   - The cost per kilo of bananas is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost for bananas is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times \$2/\text{kilo} = \$4
     \]

3. **Oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges.
   - The cost per kilo of oranges is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost for oranges is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times \$3/\text{kilo} = \$6
     \]

Now, we sum the costs of all the fruits:
\[
\$4 \text{ (apples)} + \$4 \text{ (bananas)} + \$6 \text{ (oranges)} = \$14

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( T_1 \) be the age of one of the twins.
- Let \( T_2 \) be the age of the other twin.
- Let \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_3 \) be the ages of the triplets.

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 \]

The combined ages of the individuals are 44, so we can write:
\[ T_1 + T_2 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

Since the twins are the same age, \( T_1 = T_2 \). Therefore, we can simplify the equation to:
\[ 2T_1 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

We also know that:
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 \]

Substituting \( T_1 \) in the combined age equation:
\[ 2(P_1 + 7) + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 2P_1 + 14 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 3P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 3P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 30 \]

Since the triplets are the same age, let \( P_2 = P_3 = P \). Then:
\[ 3P_1 + 2P = 30 \]

We need to find integer solutions for \( P_1 \) and \( P \). Let's test possible values for \( P_1 \):

If \( P_1 = 8 \):
\[ 3(8) + 2P = 30 \]
\[ 24 + 2P = 30 \]
\[ 2P = 6 \]
\[ P = 3 \]

So, the ages are:
- \( T_1 = 8 \)
- \( T_2 = 8 \)
- \( P_1 = 8 - 7 = 1 \)
- \( P_2 = 3 \)
- \( P_3 = 3 \)

Let's verify the combined ages:
\[ 8 + 8 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 23 \]

There seems to be an error in the initial assumption. Let's recheck the integer solutions:

If \( P_1 = 9 \):
\[ 3(9) + 2P = 30 \]
\[ 27 + 2P = 30 \]
\[ 2P = 3 \]
\[ P = 1.5 \] (not an integer)

If \( P_1 = 7 \):
\[ 3(7) + 2P = 30 \]
\[ 21 + 2P = 30 \]
\[ 2P = 9 \]
\[ P = 4.5 \] (not an integer)

If \( P_1 = 6 \):
\[ 3(6) + 2P = 30 \]
\[ 18 + 2P = 30 \]
\[ 2P = 12 \]
\[ P = 6 \]

So, the ages are:
- \( T_1 = 13 \)
- \( T_2 = 13 \)
- \( P_1 = 6 \)
- \( P_2 = 6 \)
- \( P_3 = 6 \)

Let's verify the combined ages:
\[ 13 + 13 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 44 \]

Thus, the age of one of the twins is:
\[
\boxed{13}

"First, let's convert the 3 hours before John has to eat dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend on his homework. He has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. Adding these times together, we get:
\[20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes}\]

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap:
\[180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the number of minutes John has to nap is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought four candies for $3.20. Therefore, the cost of one candy is:

"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]
\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person has saved over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Now, we calculate the total savings for Rong:

\[ \text{Rong's total savings} = 20 \times 120 = 2400 \]

And for Neil:

\[ \text{Neil's total savings} = 28 \times 120 = 3360 \]

Adding the total savings of both Rong and Neil gives:

\[ \text{Total coins} = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.

1. The cost of the two vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

2. Let the total bill be \( T \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the heartworm check costs:
\[ 0.60 \times T \]

3. The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

4. To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. Therefore, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of one banana. We know that one apple costs $0.50 and one banana costs twice as much as one apple. Therefore, the cost of one banana is:
\[ 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange. We know that one orange costs three times as much as one banana. Therefore, the cost of one orange is:
\[ 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the bananas in the crate. There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost of the bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1.00 = 5.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the apples in the crate. There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost of the apples is:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the oranges in the crate. There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost of the oranges is:
\[ 7 \times 3.00 = 21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total cost of the crate, we sum the costs of the bananas, apples, and oranges:
\[ 5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \boxed{32.00} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of square:

1. **Red squares**: Given as 14.
2. **Blue squares**: 4 more than red squares.
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green squares**: 6 more than blue squares.
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White squares**: 12 fewer than green squares.
   \[
   \text{White squares} = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Next, we sum the number of all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[
\text{Total squares} = 14 \, (\text{red}) + 18 \, (\text{blue}) + 24 \, (\text{green}) + 12 \, (\text{white})
\]
\[
\text{Total squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares:
\[
\text{Total area} = 68 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. According to the problem, the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant:

\[ \text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Now, let's determine the total number of chairs needed for the function. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of chairs required is:

\[ \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:

\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total current chairs} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"To find the number of 8 point bucks, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of bucks in the field.
2. Calculate 20 percent of the bucks to find the number of 8 point bucks.

First, we know that 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks. So, we calculate the number of bucks as follows:
\[ \text{Number of bucks} = 50 \times \frac{50}{100} = 50 \times 0.5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 point bucks. We know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 point bucks. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of 8 point bucks} = 25 \times \frac{20}{100} = 25 \times 0.2 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of 8 point bucks is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Betty's Points (Recheck):**
   We already calculated Betty's points as 65, so this is consistent.

5. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Next, we sum up the points collected by all students:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points}
\]
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat holds one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy 20 drinks and 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

The cost of each drink is $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of each snack is $2, so the total cost for the snacks is:
\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the drinks and the snacks together, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the group has spent a total of:

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Substituting the known values for Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, we get:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Simplifying the left side, we find:

\[ 8800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

To find Gary's truck capacity, we subtract 8800 from 11600:

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 - 8800 = 2800 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of gravel that Gary's truck can carry is:

\[ \boxed{2800} \]"

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Next, we know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Therefore, each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]
Since there are 8 males, the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the males and the females gives us the total number of dumplings cooked:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"

"First, let's determine the speed of Martha's turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second. Therefore, the speed of the turtle is:

\[
\text{Speed of the turtle} = \frac{\text{Speed of the cat}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula for distance, which is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the speed of the turtle and the time:

\[

"To determine how many additional hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to calculate how much more money they need to raise. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. Therefore, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. From the information given, in the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. So, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200. Since they raise $700 per hour, the number of additional hours required is:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Therefore, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then sum the amounts produced in the given time.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. To find the discount amount:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00
\]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's determine how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:

"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy each eat in two weeks.

Two weeks consist of 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Initially, both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, the amount of candy each has left is:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Ginger} \]
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Amy} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after two weeks, Amy has \(\boxed{14}\) more pieces of candy than Ginger."

"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps per minute for each foot:
- When her arms are down, her right foot taps at 300 taps per minute and her left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
- When her arms are raised, her right foot taps at 200 taps per minute and her left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.

Next, we need to determine the total time for each condition:
- Helga dances with her arms down for \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes.
- Helga dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes.

Now, we calculate the total taps for each foot during the time her arms are down:
- Right foot: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)

Next, we calculate the total taps for each foot during the time her arms are raised:
- Right foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)

Now, we sum the taps for each foot:
- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150\)

Finally, we sum the total taps for both feet:
\[1300 + 1150 = 2450\]

Thus, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{2450}\)."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of pizzas ordered:**
   - Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza.
   - Total pizzas = 5

2. **Total number of pizza slices:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices

3. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza.
   - Slices per pizza = 12
   - Slices eaten by each of these three = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \)
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices

4. **Slices eaten by the two remaining friends:**
   - Each of these two people ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza.
   - Slices per pizza = 12
   - Slices eaten by each of these two = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \)
   - Total slices eaten by the two remaining friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices

5. **Total slices eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (two remaining friends) = 42 slices

6. **Slices left:**
   - Total slices - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

**Final answer:**
18 slices of pizza were left."
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages, and the dog can do this in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the cat's time.

\[
\text{Time for dog} = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by the number of animals.

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"First, let's convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches and then add the additional inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]
\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these 16 cars is:
\[
16 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these 24 cars is:
\[
24 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars:
\[
64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[
\boxed{112}

"First, let's calculate the total number of spools Candy has:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we calculate the number of blue spools:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total number of blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue.

**Final Answer:**
40%"

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000

2. **People who voted by midday (12:00)**:
   - By midday, \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by midday = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000\)

3. **Remaining people after midday**:
   - Remaining people = Total people - People who voted by midday
   - Remaining people = \(5000 - 2000 = 3000\)

4. **People who voted by 16:00**:
   - By 16:00, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00 = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000\)

5. **Remaining people who had not voted by 16:00**:
   - Remaining people = Remaining people after midday - People who voted by 16:00

"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. Given that Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 \]
\[ \text{Father's age} = 30 + 8 \]
\[ \text{Father's age} = 38 \]

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age. Since Dora's mother is four years younger than her father, we have:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 \]
\[ \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Mother's age} = 34 \]

Now, we find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} \]
\[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 \]
\[ \text{Total combined age} = 87 \]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"First, let's break down the weights of each book:

- Cindy's math and science books each weigh 2 pounds. Since there are two books, the total weight for these is:
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds}
  \]

- Her French book weighs 4 pounds.

- Her English book weighs 3 pounds.

- Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs:
  \[
  2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Now, we add up the weights of all the books:

\[
4 \text{ pounds (math and science books)} + 4 \text{ pounds (French book)} + 3 \text{ pounds (English book)} + 6 \text{ pounds (history book)} = 17 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

"First, let's determine the number of votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we calculate:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we first find 50% of candidate A's votes and then add that to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{50% of candidate A's votes} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Therefore, candidate C received 50 votes.

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we calculate Beck's apples as follows:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   \[
   7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   \[
   8 \text{ small cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Next, we sum the total amount of water used:
\[
12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:
\[
32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces}
\]

Therefore, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of students in each class:**
   - The total number of students in both classes is 80.
   - Since each class has the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2.
   \[
   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of girls in each class:**
   - 40% of the students in each class are girls.
   - To find the number of girls in one class, we calculate 40% of 40.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of boys in each class:**
   - The total number of students in each class is 40.
   - The number of boys in each class is the total number of students minus the number of girls.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $26.
- The cost for each child is $12.
- There are 2 adults and 2 children.

The total cost for the first amusement park is:
\[
2 \times 26 + 2 \times 12 = 52 + 24 = 76
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $14.
- The cost for each child is $10.
- There are 2 adults and 2 children.

The total cost for the second amusement park is:
\[
2 \times 14 + 2 \times 10 = 28 + 20 = 48
\]

Now, we find the difference between the costs of the two amusement parks to determine the savings:
\[
76 - 48 = 28
\]

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars by choosing the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily savings.**

- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each.
- The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.40 each.
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.

The daily savings per tomato is:
\[ 0.50 - 0.40 = 0.10 \text{ dollars} \]

The total daily savings for 500 tomatoes is:
\[ 500 \times 0.10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the weekly savings.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings are:
\[ 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Cal has:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Carl has. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Total marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined is:

\[ \boxed{336} \]"
"First, we determine how many students are in each of the six groups when fifty-four students are divided equally among them:
\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \text{ students per group} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for 12 groups, assuming each group still has 9 students:
\[ 12 \times 9 = 108 \text{ students} \]

Since there are only 54 students available, we need to calculate how many more students are required to form 12 groups:
\[ 108 - 54 = 54 \text{ more students needed} \]

However, the question asks how many more groups are needed, not how many more students. Since each group requires 9 students, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[ \frac{54}{9} = 6 \text{ more groups} \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single week:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

So, the number of chairs rented during weekdays in one week is:
\[ 60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ chairs} \]

And the number of chairs rented during weekends in one week is:
\[ 100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ chairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of chairs rented in one week is:
\[ 300 \text{ chairs} + 200 \text{ chairs} = 500 \text{ chairs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are rented in two 4-week months. Since there are 8 weeks in two 4-week months, we multiply the weekly total by 8:
\[ 500 \text{ chairs/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 4000 \text{ chairs} \]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas stolen} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 48 - 24 = 24
   \]
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas after adding} = 24 + 25 = 49
   \]
4. Arnold then stole 12 bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 49 - 12 = 37
   \]
5. On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas:
   \[
   \text{Final number of bananas} = 37 + 6 = 43
   \]

So, the final number of bananas in the pile is:
\[
\boxed{43}

"First, let's calculate the monthly share for each roommate:

Total monthly electricity bill = $100
Number of roommates = 4

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly electricity bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

Next, we calculate the annual share for each roommate:

Number of months in a year = 12

Annual share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * Number of months in a year
Annual share per roommate = $25 * 12
Annual share per roommate = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's determine the initial number of glasses and plates Jeff sent for the event.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. Since one dozen equals 12, we can calculate the total number of glasses and plates as follows:

- Total glasses: \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \)
- Total plates: \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \)

Next, we need to account for the items that were broken. According to the problem, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken.

- Remaining glasses: \( 96 - 10 = 86 \)
- Remaining plates: \( 48 - 6 = 42 \)

Now, we add the remaining glasses and plates to find the total number of items Jeff has now:

- Total remaining items: \( 86 + 42 = 128 \)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{128}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of a large button (since 3 small buttons = 1 large button).
   - Therefore, 27 small buttons = \(\frac{27}{3} = 9\) large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers and \(40 + 9 = 49\) large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 49 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 49 = 24.5\). Since the number of stickers must be an integer, we assume she trades 24 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 24 large stickers = 24 large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(49 - 24 = 25\) large stickers and \(49 + 24 = 73\) large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 25 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 25 large stickers = 25 large buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 25 large buttons = \(25 \times 3 = 75\) small buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(3 + 75 = 78\) small buttons.

5. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 73 large buttons and 78 small buttons.
   - The total number of buttons is \(73 + 78 = 151\).

Thus, the final number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \(\boxed{151}\)."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day.

1. On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
2. On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
3. On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we sum the matches from each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order.

1. **Extra-Small (XS) Shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.
   - \( \text{XS} = 11 \)

2. **Small (S) Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - \( \text{S} = 2 \times 11 = 22 \)

3. **Medium (M) Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - \( \text{M} = 22 - 4 = 18 \)

4. **Large (L) Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - \( \text{L} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)

5. **Extra-Large (XL) Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - \( \text{XL} = 9 + 6 = 15 \)

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed:
\[
\text{Total shirts} = \text{XS} + \text{S} + \text{M} + \text{L} + \text{XL}
\]
\[
\text{Total shirts} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15
\]
\[
\text{Total shirts} = 75
\]

Thus, Krissa needs to order \(\boxed{75}\) shirts."

"First, let's calculate how many people think horse #2 will win the race. Since 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win. This is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. So, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

This means 24 people think horse #7 will win.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people this is, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

So, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of Jana's puppies as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian puppies is:
\[
\frac{2}{3}P
\]

Next, we are told that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = \frac{2}{9}P
\]

We know from the problem statement that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Thus, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{9}P = 6
\]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by isolating \( P \):
\[
P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27
\]

Therefore, the total number of Jana's puppies is:
\[
\boxed{27}

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The number of cases of shingles needed for the third house is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Since the problem asks for the final numerical answer, we provide:
\[ \boxed{142.86} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series.
   \[
   \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200
   \]

3. **Cost of series movies**: Each series movie costs $6.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
   \]

4. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the series movies from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
   \]

5. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   \[
   \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160
   \]

6. **Cost of older movies**: Each older movie costs $5.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800
   \]

7. **Normal movies**: The rest of the remaining movies are normal movies.
   \[
   \text{Number of normal movies} = 400 - 160 = 240
   \]

8. **Cost of normal movies**: Each normal movie costs $10.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for normal movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400
   \]

9. **Total cost to replace the movies**: Sum the costs of series movies, older movies, and normal movies.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400
   \]

Thus, the total cost to replace Mike's movie collection with digital versions is:
\[
\boxed{4400}

"To determine how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit separately and then sum these costs.

1. **Peaches:**
   - Price per pound: $2.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for peaches: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$12.00 \)

2. **Plums:**
   - Price per pound: $1.00
   - Pounds picked: 8
   - Total cost for plums: \( 8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \)

3. **Apricots:**
   - Price per pound: $3.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for apricots: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$18.00 \)

"To determine the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance covered by driving and the distance covered by hiking, then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance covered by driving:
- The Llesis family drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
- Their average driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
- Therefore, the distance covered by driving is:
  \[
  \text{Distance driven} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles per hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance covered by hiking:
- The Llesis family hiked for 1.5 hours.
- Their average hiking speed was \( \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.
- Therefore, the distance covered by hiking is:
  \[
  \text{Distance hiked} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles per hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
  \]

Finally, we sum the distances covered by driving and hiking to find the total distance to the vacation spot:
\[
\text{Total distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance to the vacation spot is \(\boxed{255}\) miles."
"Let's define the variables for the number of enemies jumped on, berries collected, and seconds left on the timer for both Ava and Emma.

Let:
- \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( E_t \) be the seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

For Ava:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \) (Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \) (Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \) (Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma)

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{seconds left on the timer} \)

For Emma:
- Points = \( 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \)

For Ava:
- Points = \( 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \)
- Substituting the values of \( A_e \), \( A_b \), and \( A_t \):
- Points = \( 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \)
- Simplifying:
- Points = \( 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \)
- Points = \( 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \)

Now, we find the difference in their scores:
- Difference = Points for Ava - Points for Emma
- Difference = \( (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \)
- Difference = 215

Thus, the difference between their two scores is:
\[
\boxed{215}

"To determine how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Calculate the number of rides on the 5 usual days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day on these 5 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of rides on these 5 days is:
     \[
     3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of rides on the 2 special days:**
   - On these 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) rides per day.
   - Therefore, the total number of rides on these 2 days is:
     \[
     6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rides in a week:**

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
Rearranging terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \), we get:
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]
We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:
\[ O + W = 17 \]
Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]
Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
Subtract 17 from both sides:
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
Divide both sides by -3:
\[ W = 4 \]
Now substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):
\[ O = 17 - 4 \]
\[ O = 13 \]
So, Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

\[ \text{Total hours played} = 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours.

\[ \text{Hours still needed} = 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Determine the difference in distance between the two cars:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. 

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the materials before the premium:

- Cost of the diamond: $600
- Cost of the gold: $300

Total cost of materials = $600 + $300 = $900

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of materials:

- Premium = 30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of materials to find the final amount James paid:

- Final amount = Total cost of materials + Premium = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, the final amount James paid is $1170."
"To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

1. **Third Graders:**
   - Number of third-graders: 500
   - Number of third-graders who passed: 340

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - Number of fourth-graders: 100
   - Number of fourth-graders who passed: 40

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - Number of fifth-graders: 400
   - Pass rate for fifth graders: Twice the fourth graders' pass rate
   - Fourth graders' pass rate: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \)
   - Fifth graders' pass rate: \( 2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \)
   - Number of fifth-graders who passed: \( 0.8 \times 400 = 320 \)

Next, we sum the number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \)
- Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

Now, we calculate the overall pass rate:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total number of students who passed}}{\text{Total number of students}} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.7
\]

Expressing this as a percentage:

\[
0.7 \times 100 = 70\%
\]

Thus, the school's overall pass rate is:

\[
\boxed{70\%}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:

"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of candies Dale has after his second order:
   \[
   100 \text{ (initial order)} + 100 \text{ (additional order)} = 200 \text{ candies}
   \]

2. Subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he now has:
   \[
   200 \text{ (total candies)} - 150 \text{ (sold candies)} = 50 \text{ candies}
   \]

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \).
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil (in ounces).

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt: \( o = 2s \).
2. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest: \( s = 2z \).

We can substitute \( s = 2z \) into the equation for \( o \):
\[ o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z. \]

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ o + z + z + s + s = 10. \]
Substituting \( o = 4z \) and \( s = 2z \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4z + z + z + 2z + 2z = 10. \]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 10z = 10. \]
Solving for \( z \), we get:
\[ z = 1. \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4. \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{4}\) ounces."

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:

"To determine how much chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the production for the first three weeks and then use the total monthly production to find the fourth week's production.

1. **First week production:**
   \[
   \text{First week production} = 8,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

2. **Second week production:**
   \[
   \text{Second week production} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{First week production} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8,000 = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third week production:**
   \[
   \text{Third week production} = 3 \times \text{First week production} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total production for the first three weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Total production for the first three weeks} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Total monthly production:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly production} = 50,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

6. **Fourth week production:**
   \[
   \text{Fourth week production} = \text{Total monthly production} - \text{Total production for the first three weeks} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same highway.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \(D\) can be expressed as:
\[ D = 3 \times \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 18 \]
Let the speed of one kangaroo be \(v\). Then:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take four turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). The total speed of the four turtles combined is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of four turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"

- From 3 large apples, each sliced into 5 pieces, Adam gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, each sliced into 3 pieces, Adam gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Adding these together, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

He wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional amount of milk needed is:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig starts with. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the given information and categorize the students accordingly.

1. There are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students perform well in English only.
4. The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. We know the total number of students and the number of students in the other two categories:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good in English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group requires and then see how many such groups can fit into the 2-hour concert duration, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group needs:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Total concert time: 120 minutes
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

Time available for groups = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Finally, we divide the available time by the time each group needs to find out how many groups can perform:

- Time per group: 10 minutes

Number of groups = 110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11."
"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 202.50 = 502.50 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals mentioned in the problem:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( M = A - 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( A + M + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation:
\[ (B - 3) + (B - 3 - 2) + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
Simplify the equation:
\[ (B - 3) + (B - 5) + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B - 5 + B + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]
Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]
Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 16 \) back into the expression for \( A \):
\[ A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."

"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total amount as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received in tips. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ \boxed{1520} \]"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

- She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges.
- She gave 3 oranges to her only son.

So, the total number of oranges given away is \(6 + 3 = 9\) oranges.

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is \(12 - 9 = 3\).

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

- Claire earns 1 badge every month. Therefore, in a year (12 months), Claire earns:
  \[
  1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges}
  \]

- Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge. Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
  \[
  \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges}
  \]

- Wendy earns three times the number of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Therefore, in a year, Wendy earns:
  \[
  3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges}
  \]

Next, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[
36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges}
\]

Thus, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the number of banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, the total number of loaves is:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Red Cars:**
   - The rink has 12 red cars.

2. **Green Cars:**
   - The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars.
   - Therefore, the number of green cars is \(12 - 2 = 10\).

3. **Blue Cars:**
   - The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars.
   - Therefore, the number of blue cars is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

4. **Total Cars:**
   - The rink has 75 cars in total.

5. **Yellow Cars:**
   - To find the number of yellow cars, we need to subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.
   - The total number of red, green, and blue cars is \(12 + 10 + 30 = 52\).

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

3. Determine the weight of the carrots based on the weight of the sweet potatoes.

First, the weight of the potatoes is given as 5 pounds.

Next, the weight of the sweet potatoes is 2 times the weight of the potatoes:
\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, the weight of the carrots is 3 pounds fewer than the weight of the sweet potatoes:
\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the carrots Daisy bought is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 cups. Since one three-ounce box makes 10 cups, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost. Since each three-ounce box is on sale for $1.25, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

"First, let's determine the total monthly cost of groceries, which is $400.

Madeline pays 60% of the total cost. Therefore, the amount Madeline pays per month is:
\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the total cost:
\[ 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

This $160 is the total amount Keenan pays per month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly amount by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month):
\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

So, Keenan spends \(\boxed{40}\) dollars per week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total pieces of pizza**: 60 pieces.

2. **Pieces eaten on the first day**:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He also counts \( \frac{2}{3} \) of that number of birds flying overhead. Since he counted 6 birds nesting, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 6 is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
   \]
   So, 4 birds are flying overhead.
3. He counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. Therefore, the total number of birds in these groups is:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry counts:
\[
6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34
\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:
\[
\boxed{34}

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids and the African daisies.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Next, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids:
- The total number of petals for the daisies is 40.
- The total number of petals for the orchids is 25.
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[
\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
\]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Therefore, the number of outdoor plants is:

\[
\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[
\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
\]

To find the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%

1. Identify the speed of the thingamabob.
2. Use the speed of the thingamabob to find the speed of the whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11:

\[
\text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

\[
\text{Speed of whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Thus, the speed of the whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."
"Let's break down the costs and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the yogurt:**
   - The salad costs $6.
   - The yogurt is half the price of the salad.
   - Therefore, the cost of the yogurt is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt:**
   - The total cost of the salad and yogurt is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the total cost of the carrots:**
   - Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily diet.
   - The cost of the salad and yogurt is $9.
   - Therefore, the cost of the carrots is \( 11 - 9 = 2 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the cost of one carrot:**
   - Ellen eats 2 carrots every day.
   - The total cost of the carrots is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost of one carrot is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 per hour and received a raise of $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount Mark makes a week is:

\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work each week.

First, calculate the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Joe's lawn:
\[ \text{Earnings from Joe's lawn} = 6 \times x + 6 \times x = 12x \]

Next, calculate the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns:
\[ \text{Earnings from Kamala's lawn} = 6 \times 3x = 18x \]
\[ \text{Earnings from Alba's lawn} = 6 \times 5x = 30x \]

Now, sum up all the earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ \text{Total earnings from mowing lawns} = 12x + 18x + 30x = 60x \]

We know Tasha's total earnings from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns last month were $80. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 60x + \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 \]

To find the earnings from lemonade, we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ 60x = 80 - \text{Earnings from lemonade} \]

Since we need to find the earnings from lemonade, we rearrange the equation:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 - 60x \]

To find \( x \), we need to determine the value that makes the equation consistent. Since \( x \) must be a whole number and the total earnings from mowing lawns must be a multiple of 6 (since Joe paid $6 per mow), we can test small values of \( x \).

If \( x = 1 \):
\[ 60 \times 1 = 60 \]
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 - 60 = 20 \]

Thus, Tasha made $20 from lemonade sales.

\[
\boxed{20}

   \]
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:
   \[
   \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg}
   \]
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:
   \[
   \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg}
   \]

Therefore, Harry's weight is 74 kg."
"To determine John's profit from renting out his car, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours John rents his car each month:**
   \[
   \text{Number of times rented} = 10

"First, let's calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional distance Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the total distance Anis rowed is:

\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:

\[
50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

\[
\boxed{110}

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each read over the two days:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

**Final Answer:**

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls or
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This means the remaining soup will be used for the children.

The total capacity of the pot is 4 adult bowls, which is equivalent to 8 child bowls. After the adults have their soup, the remaining soup is:
\[ 4 \text{ adult bowls} - 2 \text{ adult bowls} = 2 \text{ adult bowls} \]

Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the remaining 2 adult bowls are equivalent to:
\[ 2 \text{ adult bowls} \times 2 \text{ child bowls/adult bowl} = 4 \text{ child bowls} \]

Calvin has 2 children, and each child will get 1 bowl of soup for lunch. Therefore, the 4 child bowls can be distributed as follows:
\[ 4 \text{ child bowls} \div 2 \text{ children} = 2 \text{ bowls/child} \]

So, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

**Final Answer:**
Each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch."
"To determine how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

First, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- William bought 5 notebooks.

\[
\text{Cost of notebooks} = 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.
- William bought 1 ballpen.

\[
\text{Cost of ballpen} = 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
\]

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:

"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we calculate the amount of material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

Next, we calculate the amount of material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Finally, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

So, the total amount of material Jo needs is \(\boxed{16}\) yards."

"First, let's determine Adam's age eight years ago. We know Duncan's current age is 60. Therefore, eight years ago, Duncan was:

\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the following equation to represent this relationship:

\[ 52 = 2 \times (\text{Adam's age four years ago}) \]

Solving for Adam's age four years ago:

\[ \text{Adam's age four years ago} = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

Now, we need to find Adam's current age. Since Adam was 26 four years ago, his current age is:

\[ 26 + 4 = 30 \]

Finally, we need to determine how old Adam will be in 8 years. Adding 8 years to his current age:

\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be \(\boxed{38}\) years old in 8 years."

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We are given that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna and that there are 20 red balloons.

First, we can express the total number of bologna pieces thrown in terms of \( R \) and \( Y \):
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

We know that \( R = 20 \). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( Y = 6 \).

   - Therefore, the number of chamomile cups in each row is \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \).
   - Similarly, the number of mint tea cups in each row is \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \).

4. **Cinnamon tea cups:**
   - The remaining cups are used to brew cinnamon tea.
   - Total cinnamon tea cups: 15.

5. **Verification:**
   - Total cups used for chamomile and mint tea in all rows: \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \) cups.
   - Since cinnamon tea cups are 15, the remaining cups for chamomile and mint tea are \( 27 - 15 = 12 \) cups.
   - This matches the total of 27 cups, confirming the distribution is correct.

Thus, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is \( \boxed{4.5} \)."
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - In 8 hours, the number of trips the sloth can make is:
     \[
     \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of berries needed per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - If the sloth makes 2 trips, the number of berries per trip is:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
     \]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The pool initially has 10,000 gallons of water, and they fill the tank with half of that amount:

\[
\text{Amount of water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day:

\[
\text{Total water used in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water:

\[
\text{Remaining water in the tank} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[
\boxed{2000}
\]"

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Junebugs removed on Monday:**
   \[
   39
   \]

2. **Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   Since she removed twice as many Junebugs as on Monday each day:
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ (Tuesday)}
   \]
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ (Wednesday)}
   \]

3. **Junebugs removed on Thursday:**
   \[
   48
   \]

4. **Junebugs removed on Friday:**
   \[
   57
   \]

Next, we sum the total number of Junebugs removed over the week:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is:
\[
300
\]

There are 5 days in the week (Monday to Friday), so we find the average by dividing the total by 5:
\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is:

"First, calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
- The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, calculate the distance traveled by the car:
- The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, find the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car:
- Difference = Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car
- Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

**Final Answer:**
60 miles"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

Here are the quantities of the other toys:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

First, we add these quantities together:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the total number of the other toys from the overall total:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as follows:
- Let \( P \) be the age of Peter.
- Let \( p \) be the age of Paul.
- Let \( j \) be the age of Jean.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( P + p + j = 100 \)
2. \( p = j + 10 \)
3. \( P = p + j \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( p \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (j + 10) + j = 2j + 10 \]

Now we have \( P \) in terms of \( j \). We can substitute \( p = j + 10 \) and \( P = 2j + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[ (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100 \]
\[ 2j + 10 + j + 10 + j = 100 \]
\[ 4j + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4j = 80 \]
\[ j = 20 \]

Now that we have \( j = 20 \), we can find \( p \) and \( P \):
\[ p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2j + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, the age of Peter is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons.
2. Maria gave herself 1 water balloon.
3. Maria's mom then gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons.

First, calculate the number of balloons given by Maria:
- Maria gave 2 balloons to each of her 4 friends: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
- Maria gave herself 1 balloon: \(1\) balloon.

So, the total number of balloons given by Maria is:
\[8 + 1 = 9\]

Next, calculate the number of balloons given by Maria's mom:
- Each of the 5 people (4 friends + Maria) received 3 more balloons: \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

Now, add the balloons given by Maria and her mom to find the total number of balloons:
\[9 + 15 = 24\]

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is:
\[

"First, let's determine the total duration of Cameron's stay. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This is a total of 17 hours.

Next, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the initial 12-hour stay and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour. The additional hours are:
\[ 17 - 12 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The cost for the additional hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding the cost of the initial 12-hour stay:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Finally, we find the difference between the two costs to determine how much Cameron saves:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} - 1350 \text{ pesos} = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, Cameron would save:
\[ \boxed{250} \text{ pesos} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. According to the problem, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the hay needed for each sheep as follows:

\[ \text{Hay needed for each sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the overall amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ \text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week:
\[ \text{Earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ \text{Remaining after gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
\[ \text{Remaining after deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Remaining after pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining money:

   - James buys 10 CDs.
   - Each CD costs $15.
   - Total cost before discount = \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - The discount is 40%.
   - Discount amount = \( 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   - Total cost after discount = \( 150 - 60 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total amount James gets from selling the CDs he doesn't like:**
   - James sells 5 CDs.
   - Each CD is sold for $40.
   - Total amount from selling 5 CDs = \( 5 \times 40 = 200 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the net amount James is out of pocket:**
   - Total cost after discount = $90.
   - Total amount from selling 5 CDs = $200.
   - Net amount out of pocket = \( 90 - 200 = -110 \) dollars.

Since the net amount is negative, it means James actually gained $110. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a net loss. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that he was not out any money but gained $110.

**Final numerical answer:**
\[
\boxed{110}

"To determine the total time James took to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum initially} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   James swims at half the initial speed.
   \[
   \text{New swimming speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal.
   - Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00.

Therefore, Cayley will earn a total commission of $15.00."
"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 21

Now, since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age.

Leo's age = 2 × Marcus's age
Leo's age = 2 × 21
Leo's age = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar scored.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The paper is stacked such that 100 pages are in 1 inch.
   - The book is 1.5 inches thick.
   - Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page on each side.

2. **Calculate the number of pages per inch:**
   - Since 100 pages are in 1 inch, the number of pages per inch is 100.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:**
   - If 1 inch contains 100 pages, then 1.5 inches will contain:
     \[
     1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages/inch} = 150 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Account for both sides of the paper:**
   - Since each paper is printed on both sides, each sheet of paper contributes 2 pages to the book.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
     \[
     \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages per sheet}} = 75 \text{ sheets}
     \]
   - Each sheet contains 2 pages, so the total number of pages is:
     \[
     75 \text{ sheets} \times 2 \text{ pages per sheet} = 150 \text{ pages}
     \]

Thus, the number of pages in the book is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he staples is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate Kim's usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Determine the time Kim woke up that day:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - 6 a.m. minus 5 minutes is 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before going to the bathroom:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m.
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 3:15 a.m. is 1 hour, which is 60 minutes.
   - From 3:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 2 hours and 40 minutes, which is \( 2 \times 60 + 40 = 160 \) minutes.
   - Total time awake before going to the bathroom: \( 60 + 160 = 220 \) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time difference is \( 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 \) minutes.

5. **Calculate the time Kim was actually asleep:**
   - Total sleep duration: 480 minutes.
   - Subtract the time she was awake before going to the bathroom: \( 480 - 220 = 260 \) minutes.
   - Subtract the time she was sleepwalking: \( 260 - 23 = 237 \) minutes.

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is \(\boxed{237}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds initially = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200.
   - New admissions = 700.
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds = 900 beds.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

**Final Answer:**
The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to family. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are sent to her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Finally, we need to determine how many of these 3 remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. The problem states that one-third of the other emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we determine Shawna's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate the age of Shawna's father, who is five times as old as Shawna:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is \(\boxed{45}\) years old."
"If Courtney reported 48 people in attendance and Kelly says that Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we can set up the following relationship to find the actual number of attendees.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%).

This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

Performing the division:
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried in terms of a variable. Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan. Therefore, the total number of balls is:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then the relationship between the number of balls carried by each boy would still hold. If Jason carried 2 balls, then \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get:
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the expression for the total number of balls, we get:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

So, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

Next, we know that at the end of the first day, they had 10 holes. By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[\boxed{11}\]"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \). According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey. Therefore, we can express the number of corn chips Collins received as:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Now, we perform the addition:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"First, let's determine the total cost of the tickets for travel. The problem states that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400. 

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the third equation:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

To verify, we can find \( X \) using the second equation:
\[ X = S + 5 \]
\[ X = 147 + 5 \]
\[ X = 152 \]

Finally, we check the total number of Pokemon:
\[ X + S + A = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339 \]
The total is correct, so the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long and that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend watching all the episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird travels in each direction and then find the net distance.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south and north:
- Net distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Net distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the difference between the total distance traveled south and the distance traveled north:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[

"To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the total number of brownies she received and consumed.

1. **Initial Batch:**
   Greta made one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. **Office Party:**
   She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. **Surprise Party:**
   Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

4. **Total Brownies Received:**
   Adding all the brownies together:
   \[
   12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (office party)} + 48 \text{ (surprise party)} = 66 \text{ brownies}

"First, let's determine the ages of each family member:

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so his brother is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(0.25 \times 8 = 2\). Therefore, Nani's sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.

The price of the first two phones is $600 each. Therefore, the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, so each of these phones costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

The cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the costs of all four phones together, we get:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid for the phones is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"

"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \cdot 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to afford the books. He has already saved $14, so the additional amount needed is:

Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:

Number of hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Number of hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

   - Over 8 days, the total number of hours she will be outside is:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is:
     \[
     32 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 32 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of bottles needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.
   - To find out how many bottles are needed, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount per bottle:
     \[
     \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Thus, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"First, let's determine the price of the red car. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price and subtract it from the blue car's price.

The price of the blue car is $100. 

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

The total cost of both cars is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 / 2 = 12\) years old.

Now, let's determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is:
\[43 + 7 = 50\]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

Now, let's add up all the beads:

- Beads from her mother: 20
- Beads from her sister: 30
- Beads from her friend: 40

Total beads = \(20 + 30 + 40 = 90\)

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we calculate the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class of 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate 25% of 24:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, we determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes of their boots and then dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of the shoe worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the plants and the spacing to the same unit:**
   - Each plant grows 12 inches wide. Convert this to feet: \( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 1 \text{ foot} \).
   - The space between each plant is 1.5 feet.

2. **Calculate the total space required for one plant and the space between it and the next plant:**
   - Space for one plant and the space between it and the next plant: \( 1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet} \).

3. **Determine the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long. Divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for one plant and the space between it and the next plant: \( \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \).
   - Since Pat can only have whole plants, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants needed:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers. Subtract this from the total number of plants needed: \( 44 - 17 = 27 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6. Multiply the number of additional plants by the cost per plant: \( 27 \times 6 = 162 \).

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) as many pretzels as Edgar. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, his brother eats:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels a day} \]

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost of the petunias for one basket:
- Each basket contains 3 petunias.
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
\[
3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines for one basket:
- Each basket contains 2 sweet potato vines.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
\[
2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per sweet potato vine} = \$5.00
\]

Now, let's find the total cost for one basket by adding the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines:
\[
\$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00
\]

Finally, we need to find the total cost for all 5 baskets:
\[
5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00
\]

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With the remaining 3 pounds of soil, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly salary.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, let's calculate how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both the peeling and sauteing processes.

1. **Peeling Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sauteing Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To saute 90 shrimp, we need to determine how many batches of 30 shrimp she needs to saute:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes, sauting 90 shrimp will take:
     \[
     3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to complete both tasks is the sum of the peeling time and the sauteing time:
     \[
     15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Emily \(\boxed{45}\) minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Low Speed Cooling:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 2 degrees per hour on low.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\).

2. **High Speed Cooling:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 3 degrees per hour on high.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\).

3. **No Air Conditioner Running:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.
   - It was turned off for 2 hours.
   - Total warming during this period: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\).

4. **Net Temperature Change:**
   - Total cooling: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\).
   - Total warming: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\).
   - Net temperature change: \(18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\).

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \( D \).
   - According to the problem, Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. So, \( D = 30 \).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then his age when he saw the comet for the first time is \( 90 - 75 = 15 \) years old.

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill.
   - Number of checks per year: \(12\) (since there are 12 months in a year).

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill.
   - Number of checks per year: \(12\) (since there are 12 months in a year).

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church.
   - Number of checks per year: \(2 \times 12 = 24\) (since there are 12 months in a year).

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check per quarter to the pest and lawn service.
   - Number of checks per year: \(4\) (since there are 4 quarters in a year).

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is \(\boxed{52}\)."
"Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the second plane makes 44 trips, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 44 = \frac{F}{2} \]
Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The number of remaining flights is:
\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]

Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl**: Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote's howl**: Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. Therefore, Chikote's howl lasts:
   \[
   2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]
3. **Igneous's howl**: Igneous howls for as long as the combined duration of Tobias's and Chikote's howls. Therefore, Igneous's howl lasts:
   \[
   20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total duration of all three wolves' howls combined:
\[
20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[
\frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total cost of the trousers.
2. Determine how much money Adam's mother gave him.
3. Determine how much money Adam's father gave him.
4. Calculate the total amount of money given by his parents.
5. Subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The total cost of the trousers is $30.
2. Adam's mother gave him $6.
3. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
4. The total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
5. The amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is the total cost of the trousers minus the total amount given by his parents, which is \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. Akbar's age \( A = 3 \) years.
2. Alessandro's age \( B = 4 \) years.
3. The total age of the children is 20 years.
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age of the children as:
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( B \):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

Since \( H + W = 13 \), we can substitute this into the average age formula:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{7 + 13}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Given that \( H \) is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

- Money collected from neighbors: $500
- Money collected from the online fund: $1500

Adding these amounts together gives:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. According to the problem, the lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:
\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. With 100 guests and each bringing a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 2 \text{ (adults)} \times 2x \text{ (each adult's slice)} + 4 \text{ (kids)} \times x \text{ (each kid's slice)} = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \( 8x \). Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets \(\boxed{25\%}\) of the watermelon."
"First, let's break down the time Doctor Jones will spend on each activity:

1. **Clinic Work**: 9 hours
2. **Inpatient Rounds**: 10 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient
3. **Appointments**: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment

Now, let's calculate the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:

- **Inpatient Rounds**: \(10 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes} = 200 \text{ minutes}\)
  - Convert minutes to hours: \(200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = \frac{200}{60} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ hours}\)

- **Appointments**: \(10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 300 \text{ minutes}\)
  - Convert minutes to hours: \(300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours}\)

Next, add up the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:

- Total time for inpatient rounds and appointments: \(3.33 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8.33 \text{ hours}\)

Now, add the time spent at the clinic:

- Total time spent: \(9 \text{ hours} + 8.33 \text{ hours} = 17.33 \text{ hours}\)

Finally, subtract the total time spent from the 24 hours in a day to find out how many hours are left for updating records:

- Time left: \(24 \text{ hours} - 17.33 \text{ hours} = 6.67 \text{ hours}\)

Therefore, the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records is:

\[
\boxed{6.67}

2. Calculate the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Determine the total number of porcupines after a year.

**Step 1: Determine the number of female porcupines.**

The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.
\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of baby porcupines born each month.**

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of baby porcupines born each month is:
\[
\text{Number of baby porcupines born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

**Step 3: Determine the total number of porcupines after a year.**

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of baby porcupines born in a year is:
\[
\text{Number of baby porcupines born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines will be the initial population plus the number of baby porcupines born in a year:
\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1490}

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Calculating the volume step by step:

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Calculating the number of gallons:

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Calculating the cost:

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Red Sticks**: There are 9 red sticks.
2. **Blue Sticks**: There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is:
   \[
   9 + 5 = 14
   \]
3. **Yellow Sticks**: The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is:
   \[
   14 - 3 = 11
   \]

Now, we sum up all the sticks:
\[
9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34
\]

So, the total number of sticks is:
\[
\boxed{34}
\]"
"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Speed} = 55 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 4 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 55 \times 4 = 220 \text{ miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Speed} = 45 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 10 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 45 \times 10 = 450 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 - 220 = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

5. **Number of students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

6. **Number of male students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

7. **Number of female students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the first day:
     \[
     4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the second day:
     \[
     3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days:**
   \[
   7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining capacity of the tank:**
   \[

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. Therefore, the charge remaining after 5 hours can be calculated as:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

After 5 hours, the power bank continues to lose 7% of its charge each hour. So, the charge remaining after the next 3 hours can be calculated as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

Now, we multiply these values together:
\[ 0.624032 \times 0.804357 \approx 0.5018 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.5018 = 0.28 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.5018} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to two decimal places, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park is:
\[ x \approx 55.78\% \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park is:
\[ \boxed{55.78\%} \]"
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, making a total of $25 per hour. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 1000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Janet wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. Therefore, the amount she needs to save is:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000. Since she earns $1000 per week, the number of weeks required is:

\[ \frac{2000 \text{ dollars}}{1000 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased.

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total amount spent so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, let's determine the total number of sweets Anne has. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is:
\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, Anne kept 2 packs for herself. Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces she kept is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces left to give to her friends is:
\[ 900 - 120 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:
\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces of sweets each of her friends received is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% increase),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be \( \boxed{139} \) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album and then find out how many of those were selfies and portraits.

First, we know that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and divided them equally among 8 albums. So, we calculate the number of pictures per album:

\[
\frac{72}{8} = 9

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{Number of small stuffed animals sold} \times \text{Price of a small stuffed animal}) + (\text{Number of large stuffed animals sold} \times \text{Price of a large stuffed animal}) \]
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is \( x = 6 \). Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \), we have:

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% or 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% or 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (100% - 40%) or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} + 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 1250 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans and then use these relationships to find the number of small jelly beans he can consume.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to one medium jelly bean is:
     \[
     3 \text{ small jelly beans}
     \]
   - Since Grandpa can eat 150 medium jelly beans, the number of small jelly beans he can eat is:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450
     \]

Thus, the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is:
\[
\boxed{450}

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate her total earnings from the jury duty:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total parking expenses:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the parking expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate her net pay per hour by dividing her net earnings by the total number of hours worked:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes \(\boxed{2}\) dollars per hour after expenses."

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - The number of intervals between bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \) intervals.
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Determine the time to drop the candy in each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is \( 8 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \).

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \(\boxed{40}\) seconds."

- Each box contains 40 apples.
- Uncle Franky ordered 2 boxes.

So, the total number of apples is:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of apples he can make with 80 apples, given that each pack contains 8 apples:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ apples}}{8 \text{ apples/pack}} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make \(\boxed{10}\) packs of apples."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese that Amor buys. The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she buys 2 pounds:

\[ 11 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 2 \, \text{pounds} = 22 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the mozzarella cheese that Amor buys. The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she buys 3 pounds:

\[ 6 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 3 \, \text{pounds} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total amount spent:

\[ 22 \, \text{dollars} + 18 \, \text{dollars} = 40 \, \text{dollars} \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after her purchases, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money she had:

\[ 50 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of loans:**
   Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   \[
   \text{Total loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working while in school:**
   Jim had a job earning $25,000 per year before college. He did not work during the 4 years he was in college.
   \[
   \text{Total income lost} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn:**
   This is the sum of the total loans and the total income lost.
   \[
   \text{Total amount to earn} = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000
   \]

4. **Determine Jim's new income after earning a college degree:**
   His income tripled after earning the degree.
   \[
   \text{New income} = 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000
   \]

5. **Calculate the time required to earn the total amount:**
   We need to find out how many years it will take to earn $300,000 at a new income of $75,000 per year.
   \[
   \text{Time required} = \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, it will take Jim \(\boxed{4}\) years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \] square feet."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average over the three races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Loss in the first race: \( L_1 = 5 \)

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Amount won in the second race: \( W_2 = 2 \times L_1 + 1 = 2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Loss in the third race: \( L_3 = 1.5 \times W_2 = 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5 \)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost and the total amount won over the three races.

- Total loss: \( L_1 + L_3 = 5 + 16.5 = 21.5 \)
- Total win: \( W_2 = 11 \)

The net loss is the total loss minus the total win:
\[ \text{Net loss} = L_1 + L_3 - W_2 = 21.5 - 11 = 10.5 \]

To find the average loss per race, we divide the net loss by the number of races (3):
\[ \text{Average loss per race} = \frac{\text{Net loss}}{3} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5 \]

Therefore, the average loss per race is:
\[ \boxed{3.5} \]"
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America.
2. Calculate the total population by multiplying the number of cities by the number of people living in each city.

First, we know there are 26 countries in South America. Each country has 5 cities. Therefore, the total number of cities in South America is:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, we know that each city has 1000 people living in it. Therefore, the total population of South America is:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for consistency since the final heights will be compared in inches.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the time worked per day into hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the hours worked per day by the team is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is:
     \[
     3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

First, combine the terms involving \( x \):
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot (2x) + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved \( x = 6 \) balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and \( n = 3 \) years.

Let's calculate the value step by step:

1. Calculate the value after 1 year:
\[ \text{Value after 1 year} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21) = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800 \]

2. Calculate the value after 2 years:
\[ \text{Value after 2 years} = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12482 \]

3. Calculate the value after 3 years:
\[ \text{Value after 3 years} = 12482 \times 0.79 = 9831.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9831.78} \]"

5. **Total Slices Eaten**: To find the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia, we add their individual slices together:
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31
   \]

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[
\boxed{31}

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( D \). We do this by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to break down each component of the charges:

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's visit charge**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of painkillers**: The cost is $4 per pill for 30 pills, so:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Parking charge**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, so:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum all these costs:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:
\[
\boxed{482}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, 80% of the emails do require a response.

The number of emails that require a response each day is:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. We do this by multiplying the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is:
\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many classes as on Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many classes as on Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

First, add 32 and 64:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]

Next, add 96 and 96:

\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]

Then, add 192 and 30:

\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]

Finally, add 222 and 25:

\[
222 + 25 = 247

   \]

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is \(\boxed{95}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of the pizzas they ordered:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of the small coupons and the cost of the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the number of meatballs in the initial order:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - \(7 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 28 \text{ meatballs}\).

3. **Determine how many meatballs Mark ate:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(4 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 16 \text{ meatballs}\).

4. **Calculate the number of meatballs remaining after Mark ate:**
   - \(28 \text{ meatballs} - 16 \text{ meatballs} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

5. **Determine the number of additional meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - \(3 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

6. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches:**
   - The remaining meatball sub sandwiches are the initial 3 minus the 4 that Mark ate, plus the additional 3 ordered.
   - \(3 \text{ remaining sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

Therefore, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Determine the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is:
     \[
     4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - Since 1.5 pounds of butter costs $6.00, we need to find out how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds.
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}
   \]
   - The total cost for 4 sets is:
     \[
     4 \times 6.00 = 24.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:

"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who said they could not come. Therefore, the number of guests who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests. For each additional guest beyond the first 20, the cost is $6. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the base rental fee to the cost of the additional guests gives the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"Let's start by determining how much money Maggie and Riza each originally had.

1. **Maggie's Initial Amount:**
   - Maggie spent a quarter of her money and was left with $60.
   - Let \( M \) be the amount of money Maggie originally had.
   - Maggie spent \(\frac{1}{4}M\), so she has \(\frac{3}{4}M\) left.
   - We know \(\frac{3}{4}M = 60\).
   - Solving for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
     \]
   - Therefore, Maggie originally had $80.

2. **Riza's Initial Amount:**
   - Riza spent one-third of her money and was left with $60.
   - Let \( R \) be the amount of money Riza originally had.
   - Riza spent \(\frac{1}{3}R\), so she has \(\frac{2}{3}R\) left.
   - We know \(\frac{2}{3}R = 60\).
   - Solving for \( R \):
     \[
     R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
     \]
   - Therefore, Riza originally had $90.

3. **Total Money Spent:**
   - Maggie spent \(\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\) dollars.
   - Riza spent \(\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30\) dollars.
   - Total money spent by both is \(20 + 30 = 50\) dollars.

4. **Total Money Left:**
   - Maggie has $60 left.
   - Riza has $60 left.
   - Total money left is \(60 + 60 = 120\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Maggie and Riza have left is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of bananas by 7:

\[
\frac{315 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 45 \text{ bananas per day}
\]

Now, let's calculate the number of bananas each of the first two monkeys eats per day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey:

\[
10 \text{ bananas} + 4 \text{ bananas} = 14 \text{ bananas per day}
\]

Next, we find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day by subtracting the number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten per day:

\[
45 \text{ bananas per day} - 10 \text{ bananas per day} - 14 \text{ bananas per day} = 21 \text{ bananas per day}
\]

Thus, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."

"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five $5 bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs to find the difference:
\[ 30 - 25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

To make up the $5 shortfall, she will need to pay with a $5 bill. Since the florist only gives change in quarters, the $5 bill will be exchanged for:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

After paying with the $5 bill, Jenny will receive 20 quarters as change. Therefore, the number of quarters she leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to collect to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from her goal:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800.

The discount amount is:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of seconds in 4 hours is:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 14400 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create:
     \[
     14400 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create:
     \[
     5 \times 14400 = 72000 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is:

Given:
\[ B = 90 \]
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is \( 195 \).

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"
"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to consider the total distance he walked and his walking speed.

1. The distance from James's home to the store is 4 miles.
2. James walked halfway to the store, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
3. He then had to walk back home, which is another 2 miles.
4. Therefore, the total distance James walked is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) miles.
5. James's walking speed is 4 miles per hour.

To find the time it took James to walk 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the time it took James to reach the store is \(\boxed{1}\) hour."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times 0.80 \text{ dollars per banana} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00 and she bought 10 bunches, the total cost is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars per bunch} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the annual growth rate is:

\[
\text{Annual growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, we use this annual growth rate to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."

"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:

\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on these days.

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time spent learning in a week is the sum of the time spent in classes and the extra learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 1700 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1700 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:

\[ \boxed{28.33} \]"
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial drop height is:
   \[
   3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
   \[
   72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
   \[
   48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:
\[
\boxed{32 \text{ feet}}
\]"
"Let's break down the heights step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child's height in inches is:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
   \[
   72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:
   \[
   69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is \(\boxed{72}\) inches."
"To determine how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bags sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:
\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples per bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

\[
\boxed{1080}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\]

So, the cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\)."

   - She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
   - After taking 1 unshaken soda, there are 2 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas left.

2. **Brother's Action:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas.
   - After his action, there are 1 shaken soda and 0 unshaken sodas left.

3. **Final Setup:**
   - There is 1 shaken soda and 0 unshaken sodas left.
   - Ellen's friend comes along and takes 1 soda.

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - Since there is only 1 shaken soda left out of the 1 soda that Ellen's friend takes, the probability that the soda taken is shaken is 100%.

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:

\[
\boxed{100\%}

"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

- Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
  \]

- Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Finally, we add the distances traveled by both trains to find the total distance between them after 3 hours.

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, the two trains are \(\boxed{270}\) miles apart after 3 hours."

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- Length of the biggest slide: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest slide:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- Length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest slide:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[
\text{Difference} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{J}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:

Given:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600.

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the school. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. Therefore, the number of girls is:
\[ 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"First, let's determine the time each person spent on their chores:

1. **Amalia's time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's time:**
   - Megan's chore was to walk the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's time:**
   - Dior's chore was to do laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours + 1 hour (to ensure it's ""well over 4 hours"") = 9 hours.

Now, we sum up the time each person spent on their chores:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:

\[
\boxed{19}

"To determine how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip distance = 2 × One-way distance
   - Round trip distance = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for all visits in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance = Number of visits × Round trip distance
   - Total distance = 2 × 280 miles = 560 miles

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:
\[
\boxed{560}

"First, let's determine how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let \( B \) represent the number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ B = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total production of the first 4 workers:**
   - 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each.
     \[
     2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} = 12 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]
   - 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each.
     \[
     2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} = 8 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]
   - Combined production of the first 4 workers:
     \[
     12 \text{ toys/hour} + 8 \text{ toys/hour} = 20 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total production of the first 4 workers in 10 hours:**
   \[
   20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of toys needed and the shortfall:**
   - The order requires 400 toys.
   - By the end of the shift, 20 toys are still needed.
     \[
     400 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys}
     \]

4. **Calculate the production rate of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker works for 10 hours.
   - The fifth worker must produce the remaining 180 toys.

   - Since Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.

3. **Luis received 32 stickers from Seth.**
   - Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Thus, Seth had \(\boxed{64}\) stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

\[ 3 \text{ large bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per large bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many M&M are in these 30 ounces. Since there are 30 M&M in an ounce:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M} \]

John wants to put 10 M&M in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M by the number of M&M per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M}}{10 \text{ M&M per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Therefore, John can make \(\boxed{90}\) small bags."
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we can follow these steps:

"Let's define the number of eggs painted by each person with variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and there are 200 crayons:
\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes:
\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:
\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000 and her brother earns $10000, so together they earn:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we find the total amount of money they all have together by adding Valerie's salary, her brother's salary, and their mother's salary:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The distance she covers on the beach is 2 miles. Using the formula \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \), we can find her speed on the beach:
\[
2 = v \times 40 \implies v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find the time it takes for her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using the speed on the sidewalk \( 2v \):
\[
2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
\]

The time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is:
\[
\text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[
40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 every week for 8 weeks.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal.

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings.

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial number of marbles Bob has:**
   - Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles and then has 60 marbles.
   - 2 dozen marbles is equal to \(2 \times 12 = 24\) marbles.
   - Therefore, if Bob initially had \(x\) marbles, after receiving 24 more, he has \(x + 24 = 60\).
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x + 24 = 60
     \]
     \[
     x = 60 - 24
     \]
     \[
     x = 36
     \]
   - So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

2. **Calculate the number of marbles after losing 10:**
   - If Bob loses 10 marbles from his initial 36, the number of marbles he will have is:
     \[
     36 - 10 = 26
     \]

Therefore, the final number of marbles Bob will have is \(\boxed{26}\)."
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, which means the average temperature of the mixed water is at least 40 degrees.

The total volume of water in the bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces. The total temperature of the mixed water is the sum of the temperatures of the two portions of water, which is \( 4 \times 33 + 1 \times T \).

The average temperature of the mixed water is given by:
\[
\frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the inequality:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:
\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:
\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the cost is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the total cost. So, the cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
   \]

2. **Find out how many scoops make up 1 scoop of mashed potatoes:**
   It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes for 2 scoops}
   \]
   \[
   3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops per 3 potatoes}
   \]
   Therefore, 1 scoop of mashed potatoes requires:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} \text{ potatoes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes for 18 scoops:**
   Since 1 scoop requires \(\frac{3}{2}\) potatoes, 18 scoops will require:
   \[
   18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \text{ potatoes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is:

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equations to find the number of men and women.

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

So, the number of men is:
\[5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\]

And the number of women is:
\[9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\]

Next, we need to find out how many women remain on the bus after 20 women alight. Initially, there are 54 women, and 20 women leave the bus:

"To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

2. **Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners:**
   - The probability of both events happening (both tickets being winners) is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the combined probability is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the combined probability to a percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, multiply by 100.
   - \(0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\).

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - So, he sells 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells a quarter of the remaining land for $30.
   - A quarter of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - So, he sells 10 square meters for $30.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money from the final sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - The total money earned from all sales is the sum of the money from each sale.
   - Total earnings = $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $90 (from the final sale) = $170.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree over its first 10 years of life.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 3 \times 50 = 150 \) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 7 \times 50 = 350 \) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - Let the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree be \( x \).
   - Therefore, the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree is \( x - 200 \).

5. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 20 \times 50 = 1000 \) fruits.
   - So, \( x = 1000 \).

6. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) fruits.

7. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Does not produce any fruits.
   - \( 0 \) fruits.

8. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 1000 fruits.

Now, let's sum up the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R = 4B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Next, substitute \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, substitute \( Y = 12 \) back into \( B = Y - 7 \):
\[ B = 12 - 7 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 0.20 \times 100 \text{ pods} = 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since the cost per pod is $0.10, the number of pods you can get for $1 is:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

If you use 1 pod per cycle, then with $1 you can run:

\[ 10 \text{ cycles} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday = \( 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage:**
   - The teacher conserves chalk and uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - Daily usage = 20% of the remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the remaining chalk each day:**
   - Let \( C_n \) be the remaining chalk after \( n \) days.
   - \( C_{n+1} = C_n \times (1 - 0.20) = C_n \times 0.80 \).

4. **Find the number of days before the chalk is less than 2 inches:**
   - We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( C_n < 2 \) inches.
   - Starting with \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches, we calculate the remaining chalk each day:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     C_1 &= 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \text{ inches} \\
     C_2 &= 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \text{ inches} \\
     C_3 &= 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \text{ inches} \\
     C_4 &= 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \text{ inches} \\
     C_5 &= 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112 \text{ inches} \\
     \end{align*}
     \]
   - After 5 days, the remaining chalk is 0.90112 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

Therefore, the teacher has \(\boxed{5}\) days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk."
"To determine how many students are not on varsity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of girls on varsity.
2. Calculate the number of boys on varsity.
3. Determine the number of girls not on varsity.
4. Determine the number of boys not on varsity.
5. Sum the number of girls and boys not on varsity to get the total number of students not on varsity.

First, we calculate the number of girls on varsity:
\[
\text{Number of girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]
So, the number of girls not on varsity is:
\[
12 - 4 = 8
\]

Next, we calculate the number of boys on varsity:
\[
\text{Number of boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]
So, the number of boys not on varsity is:
\[
12 - 3 = 9
\]

Now, we sum the number of girls and boys not on varsity:
\[
8 + 9 = 17
\]

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of teeth James has:**
   \[
   \text{Total teeth} = 30
   \]

2. **Determine the number of teeth the dentist drills:**
   \[
   \text{Teeth drilled} = 4
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of teeth the dentist caps:**
   \[
   \text{Teeth capped} = \text{Teeth drilled} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11
   \]

4. **Find the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist:**
   \[
   \text{Total teeth fixed} = \text{Teeth drilled} + \text{Teeth capped} = 4 + 11 = 15
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Total teeth fixed}}{\text{Total teeth}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:
\[
\boxed{50\%}

"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount had passed the expiry date.

The amount of milk that passed the expiry date is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we calculate the refund amount. The company sold the milk at $3.5 per gallon, so the refund for 1600 gallons is:
\[
1600 \times 3.5 = 1600 \times \frac{35}{10} = \frac{1600 \times 35}{10} = \frac{56000}{10} = 5600
\]

Therefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:
\[
\boxed{5600}

"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin as \( W \) and \( C \) respectively.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the current age of Colin is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:**
   - Bob can buy 100 books for $500.
   - To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27,000, we divide $27,000 by $500:
     \[
     \frac{27000}{500} = 54
     \]
   - Therefore, Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books.

2. **Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy:**
   - Since each set contains 100 books, the total number of books is:
     \[
     54 \times 100 = 5400
     \]

3. **Determine the number of books per school:**
   - Bob distributes the $27,000 equally among 3 schools.
   - To find out how many books each school gets, we divide the total number of books by 3:
     \[
     \frac{5400}{3} = 1800
     \]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is \(\boxed{1800}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Therefore, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas together, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

First, let's calculate the miles run on the days Sam ran 3 miles:
- Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
- This totals to \(3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}\).

Next, let's calculate the miles run on the days Sam ran 5 miles:
- Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday.
- This totals to \(5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}\).

Now, we sum the miles run on all the days:
\[9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of building snowballs:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour.

2. **Rate of melting snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour (60 minutes / 15 minutes = 4).
   - Therefore, 2 snowballs * 4 = 8 snowballs melt per hour.

3. **Net rate of snowball accumulation:**
   - Net rate = Rate of building - Rate of melting
   - Net rate = 20 snowballs/hour - 8 snowballs/hour = 12 snowballs/hour

4. **Time to accumulate 60 snowballs:**
   - We need to find the time \( t \) such that the net accumulation of snowballs equals 60.
   - Using the net rate, we set up the equation: \( 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \times t \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ snowballs} \).
   - Solving for \( t \): \( t = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \).

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary:**
   - Since the question does not specify the current year, we can assume that the current year is the year of Digimon's 20th anniversary. Therefore, the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary is 20 years.

2. **Calculate John's age 20 years ago:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age 20 years ago:**
   - According to the problem, 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - Let \(x\) be Jim's age 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, \(8 = 2x\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = \frac{8}{2} = 4\).

4. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, Jim's current age is \(4 + 20 = 24\).

The final numerical answer is:

1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

So, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered enough to cover the deficit and have some left over. The deficit is 16 bandages, so they ordered 16 more bandages.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(16 - 16 = 0\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = 100
   - Bandages used: \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(0 + 100 - 25 = 75\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means they must have started with 3 more bandages at the beginning of the third day.
   - Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 - 3 = 75 -"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. The cost per inch of haircut is $30, and May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means 2 inches were cut off.

The cost for the haircut is:
\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60 \]

Next, we add the cost of the color, which is $40.

The total cost is:

"First, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings from her hourly rate:

- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total earnings from her hourly rate for April are:
\[ \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$270 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she also receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To determine how much money Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each task he performed over the two-week period and then sum them up.

1. **Emptying the dishwasher**: Jason earns $0.50 for each time he empties the dishwasher. He did this 6 times.
   \[
   6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
   \]

2. **Doing his laundry**: Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry once.
   \[
   1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
   \]

3. **Cleaning his room**: Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room once.
   \[
   1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Taking the trash to the curb**: Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb each week. He did this twice.
   \[
   2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
   \]

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[
3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jason earned is:
\[
\boxed{9.00}

"First, we need to determine the amount of blood a single shark has. According to the information provided, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood a shark has as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in a shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have in total. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks would have:

\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
\]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red pens.
2. Calculate the number of black pens.
3. Add the number of red pens and black pens together.

First, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we know that the number of black pens is twice the number of red pens. Therefore, the total number of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens together to find the total number of pens:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Thus, the total number of pens Alain has is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[
\text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[
\text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2400}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day Planting:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. This means he planted \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Total White Oak trees planted over the two days: \(20 + 30 = 50\).
   - Total Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days: \(40 + 50 = 90\).
   - Therefore, the total number of trees planted is \(50 + 90 = 140\).

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"Let's calculate the amount of root beer remaining step by step.

1. **Initial amount of root beer:**
   Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.
   \[
   \text{Initial amount} = 24 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **After the children drank 4 gallons:**
   \[
   \text{Amount after children} = 24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After Barbie spilled 7 gallons:**
   \[
   \text{Amount after spill} = 20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}

5. **Amount of root beer available for the party:**
   On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is to be shared equally among them.
   \[
   \text{Amount per person} = \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{3} = \frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{8}{3}}

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of fish that have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, there are 22 fish with red stripes. Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

So, there are 20 fish with blue stripes. To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is:

\[
\boxed{42}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy has two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors.
     \[
     2 \text{ palettes} \times 4 \text{ colors per palette} = 8 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Amy has three makeup sets, each with 6 colors.
     \[
     3 \text{ sets} \times 6 \text{ colors per set} = 18 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Total initial eyeshadow colors:
     \[
     8 \text{ colors from palettes} + 18 \text{ colors from sets} = 26 \text{ colors}

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Mattison's height = 60 inches.
2. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is.
3. The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as he is.

Now, let's calculate each part:

1. Height of the house = 7 * Mattison's height = 7 * 60 inches = 420 inches.
2. Floor to ceiling height on the first floor = 3 * Mattison's height = 3 * 60 inches = 180 inches.

Since the house is two-story, we need to find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof. The total height of the house is the sum of the first floor's height and the second floor's height. The first floor's height is 180 inches, so the second floor's height is the total height minus the first floor's height:

Height of the second floor = Total height of the house - Height of the first floor = 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.

The height from the second floor's floor to the roof is the same as the height of the second floor, which is 240 inches.

**Final Answer:**
240 inches"
"First, let's determine how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their shells:

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by The finders from the remaining shells after Alphas:

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 420 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's denote the miles the last dog needs to walk as \( x \).

The total miles walked by all four dogs per day is the sum of the miles each dog needs to walk:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x \]

We know that the average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles. Therefore, the total miles walked by all four dogs per day can also be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 12 - 8 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

Next, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John has leftover after paying his debts is:

\[ \boxed{40000} \]"
"To determine how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we need to follow these steps:

\[ 128 \text{ kilograms} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/kilogram} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines at $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

To perform the multiplication:

\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount that Stephen needs to pay in the twelfth month is the total amount he needs to return minus the amount he has already paid:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children.
2. Determine how many of these changes are done by Jordan's wife.
3. Subtract the number of changes done by Jordan's wife from the total number of changes to find out how many changes Jordan does.

First, we calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children:
\[ 2 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ diaper changes per child per day} = 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Next, we determine how many of these changes are done by Jordan's wife. Since she changes half of the diapers:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ diaper changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of changes done by Jordan's wife from the total number of changes to find out how many changes Jordan does:
\[ 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} - 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

So, Jordan changes \(\boxed{5}\) diapers per day."

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. To find the number of blueberry cubes, we substitute \( S = 20 \) into the expression for the number of blueberry cubes:
\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \(\boxed{96}\)."

First, let's calculate the amount of lemon juice needed for the 4 gallons of regular lemonade:
- Each gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
- Therefore, 4 gallons will require \(4 \times 1 = 4\) cups of lemon juice.

Next, let's calculate the amount of lemon juice needed for the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart:
- Since the lemonade is twice as tart, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice.
- Therefore, the extra gallon will require \(2 \times 1 = 2\) cups of lemon juice.

Now, let's find the total amount of lemon juice needed:
- Total lemon juice = lemon juice for 4 gallons + lemon juice for the extra gallon
- Total lemon juice = \(4 + 2 = 6\) cups

Next, we need to convert the total amount of lemon juice into the number of lemons:
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
- Therefore, to get 6 cups of juice, Tim will need \(6 \times 6 = 36\) lemons.

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim will need is \(\boxed{36}\)."

"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

According to the problem, the tower is made out of:
- 4 blue blocks
- Twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) yellow blocks
- An unknown number of red blocks, which we denote as \( R \)

The total number of blocks in the tower is given as 32. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of blocks:

\[ 4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

   - The discounted price of the shoes is \(40 \times 0.6 = 24\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes.
   - Total amount spent = \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has after 3 weeks of completing his chores.

Ryan receives $6 each week for completing his chores. Over 3 weeks, he earns:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ryan buys ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for 4 ice cream cones is:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream from his total earnings, Ryan has:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Ryan and his 3 friends want to go to the movies. Each movie ticket costs $6.50. Since there are 4 people, the total cost for 4 movie tickets is:
\[ 4 \times 6.50 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with his remaining $13, we need to determine how many tickets he can afford at $6.50 each. Since $13 is less than $26, Ryan cannot buy 4 movie tickets. We need to find out how many tickets he can buy with $13.

Dividing $13 by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[ \frac{13}{6.50} = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in all, we need to calculate the total amount each of them spent and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate how much Ellen spent:
- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.
- Ellen also bought a photo frame for $5.
So, the total amount Ellen spent is:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Lani spent:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100. So, the total cost for the bathrobes is:
\[ 100 + 100 = 200 \]
Therefore, the total amount Lani spent is:
\[ 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, we add the amounts spent by Ellen and Lani to find the total amount spent by both of them:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

So, the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani is:
\[ \boxed{335} \]"
"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the total cost of ingredients for one jar and then for 10 jars. Finally, we'll subtract the total cost from the total revenue from selling 10 jars.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = \(1.5 \times 8 = 12\) dollars
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars

Total cost for one jar:
\[ 12 + 12 + 20 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
\[ 44 \times 10 = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:
\[ 50 \times 10 = 500 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 500 - 440 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.

   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Justin has 32 quarters.
   - Value of quarters: \( 32 \times 0.25 = 8 \) dollars.

2. **Dimes:**
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Justin has 95 dimes.
   - Value of dimes: \( 95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \) dollars.

3. **Nickels:**
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Justin has 120 nickels.
   - Value of nickels: \( 120 \times 0.05 = 6 \) dollars.

4. **Pennies:**
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Justin has 750 pennies.
   - Value of pennies: \( 750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \) dollars.

Now, we sum the values of all the coins:
\[ 8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \]

The total dollar amount in the jar is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spends at the mall.

1. Ice cream: $3.50
2. Movie tickets (for herself and her sister): $7.50 each, so for two tickets: \( 7.50 \times 2 = 15.00 \)
3. Bracelet: $8.50

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total expenditure:
\[
3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00
\]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left after her expenditures, we subtract the total amount spent from the $40:
\[
40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00
\]

Thus, the amount of money Janet has left is:
\[
\boxed{13}

"First, let's determine how many days Josh is open in a week. Since he is closed on Sunday and Wednesday, he is open for 5 days a week.

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in one week:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times \$4/\text{car} = \$60/\text{week} \]

To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ \$60/\text{week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = \$120 \]

Therefore, Josh makes \(\$120\) in 2 weeks."

"Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for half of the collection and $7 per toy for the other half.

First, we calculate the number of toys in each half:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, 6 toy soldiers will be sold at $5 each, and the other 6 toy soldiers will be sold at $7 each.

Next, we calculate the earnings from the first half:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Then, we calculate the earnings from the second half:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes net reduction/day} \]

We need to determine how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a net rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the average enrollment at Butler High School.
2. Subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

First, we know that Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year. Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School. Therefore, we calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Average enrollment at Butler High School} = 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 4000 \times 0.75 = 3000
\]

Next, we find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Thus, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:

So, the total amount of money they all raised is \(\boxed{2180}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speeds of Aaron and Vanessa and then use these to find out how long Vanessa took to complete her part of the race.

First, let's denote the speed of Aaron as \( A \) miles per minute and the speed of Vanessa as \( V \) miles per minute. According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we can write:
\[ A = \frac{V}{2} \]

Next, we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Let's denote the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles as \( T_V \) minutes. Since speed is distance divided by time, we can express Vanessa's speed as:
\[ V = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{T_V \text{ minutes}} \]

Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \( D_A \) miles. Using Aaron's speed, we can write:
\[ A = \frac{D_A \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since \( A = \frac{V}{2} \), we can substitute \( A \) in the equation for Aaron's speed:
\[ \frac{V}{2} = \frac{D_A}{16} \]

We also know that Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did. Therefore, the distance Aaron ran is half the distance Vanessa ran:
\[ D_A = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Now, substituting \( D_A = 2 \) miles into the equation for Aaron's speed:
\[ \frac{V}{2} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \]
\[ \frac{V}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \]
\[ V = \frac{1}{4} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now that we have Vanessa's speed, we can find the time \( T_V \) it took her to run 4 miles:
\[ T_V = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{V} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ miles per minute}} = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed based on the length of the dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed. Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed. He already has 6 feet of line, so the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy \(\boxed{594}\) feet of line."

1. **Calculate the cost of meals and wine per night:**
   - They order 2 meals each night.
   - Each meal costs $5.
   - They also order a $5 bottle of wine.
   - Therefore, the total cost per night is:
     \[
     2 \text{ meals} \times \$5 \text{ per meal} + \$5 \text{ for wine} = \$10 + \$5 = \$15
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for the number of nights the restaurant is open:**
   - The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the week is:
     \[
     2 \text{ nights} \times \$15 \text{ per night} = \$30

"First, let's calculate the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

Next, we need to find the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. The profit percentage is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 2.00 \]

So, the selling price per watermelon is $2.00. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. We know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \]

Next, we know that James is twice as old as Dora. Therefore, James's current age is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. We know that John had James when he was 19, so James is currently:
\[ 19 + \text{number of years since James was born} \]
Since James is currently 18, the number of years since James was born is:
\[ 18 - 19 + 19 = 18 \]
So, John was 19 when James was born, and now (18 years later), John is:
\[ 19 + 18 = 37 \]

We are also given that John had his youngest son when he was 32. Therefore, the age difference between John and his youngest son is:
\[ 37 - 32 = 5 \]
So, John's youngest son is currently 5 years old. In 3 years, he will be:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
\[
20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
\]

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of mechanic's labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is \(\boxed{230}\)."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 14 \]"
