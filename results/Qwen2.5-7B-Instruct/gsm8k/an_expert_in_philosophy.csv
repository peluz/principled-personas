"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after using some for breakfast and baking muffins.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
3. She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed to make the robe, we start by identifying the amount of each type of fiber required.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The amount of white fiber required is half the amount of blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

Next, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts needed:
\[
2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
\]

Thus, the total number of bolts needed is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs:**
   - Cost of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total cost: \( 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \)

2. **Determine the new value of the house after the repairs:**
   - The value of the house increased by 150%.
   - A 150% increase means the value is multiplied by 2.5 (since 100% + 150% = 250%, or 2.5 times the original value).
   - Original value of the house: $80,000
   - New value: \( 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \)

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost.
   - Profit: \( 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \)

Therefore, Josh's profit is \(\boxed{70000}\)."

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then subtract the distance he has covered from the initial distance to his home.

1. **Initial Trip to the Turnaround Point:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John drives for 4 hours in total to return home.
   - First 2 hours in standstill traffic: 0 miles.
   - Next 0.5 hours at 30 mph: Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - Remaining time: 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph: Distance = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance to home = 180 miles.
   - Distance traveled back = 135 miles.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
\[
\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5/\text{year}
\]

Next, we need to find the number of years \( n \) it will take for the total net profit to equal or exceed the initial cost of $90. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:
\[
7.5n
\]

We set this equal to the initial cost to find the break-even point:
\[
7.5n = 90
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

\[
\boxed{12}

"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]
   According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]

4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{x}{3} = 6 \implies x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's determine the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find out how many students are left after accounting for those who enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. So, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we determine how many students are left to enroll in hip-hop dance. This is the remaining number of students after accounting for those in contemporary and jazz dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

This means the second stop was at the 45-mile mark. Now, we need to find the distance between the first stop (20 miles) and the second stop (45 miles):
\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

The problem states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell and Allen's current ages based on the given ratio. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the sum of their current ages is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Let's break down the guesses from Gunter's friends:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these guesses. The guesses are 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and then divide by the number of guesses:

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

There are 3 guesses, so we divide the total by 3:

\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Calculate the daily care time for one dog:
   Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.

2. Calculate the daily care time for all 10 dogs:
   Since John has 10 dogs, the total daily care time is \(10 \times 0.5 = 5\) hours.

3. Calculate the weekly care time for all 10 dogs:
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly care time is \(5 \times 7 = 35\) hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Aaron's jewels} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Raymond's jewels} + 5 \]

Substituting the number of jewels Raymond has:

\[ \text{Aaron's jewels} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. We know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Siobhan's jewels} = \text{Aaron's jewels} - 2 \]

Substituting the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[ \text{Siobhan's jewels} = 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, the number of jewels Siobhan has is:

\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.

First, calculate 25% of the points scored in the first 20 minutes:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, add the points from both halves of the game to find the total points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This can be calculated by dividing 60 by 4:

\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

\[ \$75.00 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total money John gets from selling the lego sets:**
   John has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.
   \[
   13 \text{ lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per lego set} = \$195
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the video games:**
   John buys 8 video games at $20 each.
   \[
   8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160
   \]

3. **Determine how much money John has left after buying the video games:**
   John has $5 left after buying the video games.
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \$195 - \$160 - \$5 = \$30
   \]
   However, the problem states he has $5 left, which means the $30 is already accounted for in the initial calculation, and the $5 is the remaining amount after the video games and the initial calculation.

4. **Determine how many lego sets John still has:**
   Since John sold all his lego sets initially and the problem does not mention any lego sets being left unsold, the number of lego sets he still has is:
   \[
   0
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the right-hand side:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, John's running speed is \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we know her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time she spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she travels while running and walking.

Distance traveled running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance traveled walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance traveled in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

3. **Age of Brandon's iPhone:**
   Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin, we need to calculate the effective throwing distance when she is holding the sapphire gemstone.

1. Polly's normal throwing distance without the gemstone is 400 feet.
2. When holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.

So, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach out to 1000 feet. Therefore, the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon is:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pie pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the initial number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine the calorie content of the entire 300g bag of chips. Since the bag has 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day after you have already consumed 1800 calories out of your daily target of 2000 calories:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since the entire 300g bag contains 1250 calories, the number of grams per calorie is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat with 200 calories is:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat \(\boxed{48}\) grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the total cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had after purchasing the package is:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes left is:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 \]

According to the problem, after using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine how much Lloyd makes from selling eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Determine the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly earnings based on the daily earnings.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.**

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

**Step 2: Determine the daily earnings from selling the eggs.**

Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, so his daily earnings are:

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys need to be removed to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. 

The final numerical answer is:

2. **Delivery Fee**: $3.00
3. **Tip**: $4.00

First, we add the delivery fee and the tip to the initial bill:
\[ 40.00 + 3.00 + 4.00 = 47.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate the 25% fee on the new total of $47.00:
\[ 0.25 \times 47.00 = 11.75 \]

Now, we add this 25% fee to the previous total:
\[ 47.00 + 11.75 = 58.75 \]

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is:
\[ \boxed{58.75} \]"
"To find the total number of raspberries on the bush, we need to add the raspberries in the clusters to the individual raspberries.

First, calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters:
\[ 6 \text{ clusters} \times 20 \text{ raspberries per cluster} = 120 \text{ raspberries} \]

Next, add the individual raspberries:
\[ 120 \text{ raspberries} + 67 \text{ individual raspberries} = 187 \text{ raspberries} \]

So, the total number of raspberries is:
\[ \boxed{187} \]"
"To determine the number of good oranges in the basket, we need to account for the total number of oranges and subtract the ones that are not good.

1. The total number of oranges in the basket is 25.
2. One orange is bad.
3. 20% of the oranges are unripe. Therefore, the number of unripe oranges is \(20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5\).
4. There are 2 sour oranges.

Now, we sum up the bad, unripe, and sour oranges:
\[1 \text{ (bad)} + 5 \text{ (unripe)} + 2 \text{ (sour)} = 8\]

The number of good oranges is the total number of oranges minus the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges:
\[25 - 8 = 17\]

Thus, the number of good oranges is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"First, we calculate the total cost of the materials and construction:

\[ \text{Total cost of materials and construction} = \$500 + \$800 = \$1300 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of insuring the brooch, which is 10% of the total cost of materials and construction:

\[ \text{Cost of insurance} = 10\% \times \$1300 = 0.10 \times \$1300 = \$130 \]

Finally, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost of materials and construction to find the total amount Janet paid:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = \$1300 + \$130 = \$1430 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1430} \]"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial annual pension**: Marcy gets an annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years.

2. **Determine the additional pension after 20 years**: Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year.

3. **Calculate the additional pension after 20 years**: Since she quits after 30 years, she has been entitled to the additional 5% for 10 years (from year 21 to year 30).

4. **Calculate the total annual pension after 30 years**:
   - The initial annual pension is $50,000.
   - The additional pension is 5% of $50,000, which is \(0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500\).

5. **Sum the initial and additional pensions**:
   - Total annual pension = Initial annual pension + Additional annual pension
   - Total annual pension = $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be **$52,500**."

"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys').
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 5 (girls) + 5 (boys) = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 2 coaches

Therefore, for each school, the total number of people is:
\[ 10 \text{ players} + 2 \text{ coaches} = 12 \text{ people} \]

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:
\[ 12 \text{ people/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 48 \text{ people} \]

Final numerical answer:
48"
"To determine the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds**: The number of diamonds is given as 175.
2. **Rubies**: The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds. Therefore, the number of rubies is:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. **Emeralds**: The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, we sum the number of each type of gem to find the total number of gems in the chest:
\[
175 + 140 + 280 = 595

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way with the cost of buying them in the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Each package contains 3 flowers.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- The cost for 6 packages is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Each package contains 2 flowers.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- The cost for 9 packages is \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \) dollars.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.00.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.00.

The difference in cost, which represents the savings, is:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the number of games the team won is \( 15 \).

Final numerical answer:

"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of rings for each of the three alarms and then sum them up.

1. **First Alarm:**
   - The first alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second Alarm:**
   - The second alarm rang for three times as long as the first alarm.
   - Since the first alarm rang 4 times, the second alarm also rang 4 times (assuming the number of rings is the same as the duration in terms of cycles).

3. **Third Alarm:**
   - The third alarm rang for half as long as the second alarm.
   - Since the second alarm rang 4 times, the third alarm rang \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of rings from all three alarms:
\[
4 \text{ (first alarm)} + 4 \text{ (second alarm)} + 2 \text{ (third alarm)} = 10
\]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.
2. **Annual Salary for the First 5 Years**: Since the salary does not change for the first five years, her annual salary remains $600 * 12 = $7200.
3. **Salary Increase After 5 Years**: After 5 years, her salary increases by 10% of the initial salary. The increase is $600 * 10% = $60. Therefore, her new monthly salary is $600 + $60 = $660.
4. **Annual Salary After 5 Years**: Her new annual salary is $660 * 12 = $7920.
5. **Salary Increase After 10 Years**: After another year (total 6 years), her salary increases by another 10% of the initial salary. The increase is $600 * 10% = $60. Therefore, her new monthly salary is $660 + $60 = $720.
6. **Annual Salary After 10 Years**: Her new annual salary is $720 * 12 = $8640.
7. **Salary Increase After 11 Years**: After another year (total 7 years), her salary increases by another 10% of the initial salary. The increase is $600 * 10% = $60. Therefore, her new monthly salary is $720 + $60 = $780.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold \(\boxed{8000}\) copies."
"First, let's determine how many guests are expected to actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, this means that 3/4 of the invited guests will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests expected to attend is:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of gift bags required. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest who shows up. Therefore, the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:

"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adults and the children.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children:
- Each child will eat half as much as an adult, so each child will eat \( \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \).
- There are 5 children.

\[
5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we add the amounts needed for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad required:

\[

"To determine the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of pets Cindy has:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Calculate the number of pets Marcia has:**
   Marcia has two more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Number of pets Marcia has} = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pets Jan has:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   \[
   \text{Number of pets Jan has} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   Add the number of pets each person has.
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28
   \]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"Let's define the ages of the kids using variables and the information given:

1. Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
2. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy's age is \( J + 5 \).
3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( J + 5 + 2 = J + 7 \).
4. James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).

From the above, we know Corey's age is 11. Therefore, we can set up the equation for Corey's age:
\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. If Gerald's speed improved by 10%, his new time will be 90% of his original time (since a 10% improvement means he is now running 90% as long as he used to):

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is given as 60.
   - The number of cats is two times the number of dogs. Therefore, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the combined number of pet dogs and cats:**
   - The combined number of pet dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).

3. **Determine the number of rabbit pets:**
   - The number of rabbit pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbit pets is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits. Therefore, the total number of pets is \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Since the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:
\[
200 - 80 = 120
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. The problem states that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[
120 - 80 = 40
\]

Thus, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[
\text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes in the can.

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes in one can**: Since the sauce made from one can of tomatoes is 8 ounces (half of 16 ounces), the volume of tomatoes in one can is 16 ounces.

3. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces. Given that each can produces 8 ounces of sauce, the number of cans used is:
   \[
   \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

5. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used**: Since Freda used 4 cans and each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of tomatoes Freda used is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Given:
- Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
- 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars remaining in the traffic jam is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam.

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. This can be expressed as:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, the total number of potted plants she already has is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, the total number of potted plants she will give away is:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we add the 18 new potted plants she received to her current total and then subtract the number of plants she will give away:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \( 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell \( 60 + 10 = 70 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all four friends:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day."
"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by day and then sum it up.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
   - He also has a glass of water before bed.
   - Therefore, each weekday, John drinks 4 glasses of water.
   - Over 5 weekdays, he drinks \(5 \times 4 = 20\) glasses of water.

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - On weekends, John still has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed.
   - However, he has a soda with dinner instead of water.
   - Therefore, each weekend day, John drinks 3 glasses of water.
   - Over 2 weekend days, he drinks \(2 \times 3 = 6\) glasses of water.

3. **Total for the week:**
   - Adding the water consumption from weekdays and weekends, we get \(20 + 6 = 26\) glasses of water.

Thus, John drinks \(\boxed{26}\) glasses of water in a week."
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we start by understanding the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[
\text{Time per mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to cover the entire 42 miles of the city. We do this by multiplying the time per mile by the total number of miles:
\[
\text{Total time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

To perform the multiplication:
\[
42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 14 \times 10 = 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it will take the fog bank \(\boxed{140}\) minutes to cover the whole city."

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box and then calculate its inner volume. Finally, we will multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume for all 3 boxes.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
   - Inner width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
   - Inner height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Substituting the inner dimensions:
     \[
     V = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
     \[
     \text{Total inner volume} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\) cubic inches."

\[
5.5 + 0.5x = 7
\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[
0.5x = 1.5
\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[
x = 3
\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

**Final Answer:**
\[

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore:**
   - Julia is 64 seconds away from the shore.
   - It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - Therefore, the total distance is:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
     \[
     \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water taken on during the journey:**
   - Julia rows 80 feet to reach the shore.
   - The total amount of water taken on is:
     \[
     \text{Total water} = 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} = 16 \text{ liters}
     \]

Thus, the boat had taken on \(\boxed{16}\) liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought:
- She bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:
- She sells the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at the current price, which is 50% higher than the original price of $10.
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15 \text{ per board}
  \]
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- She sells the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at the current price, which is 50% higher than the original price of $16.
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24 \text{ per board}
  \]
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- Therefore, the total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90
\]

Thus, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{90}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total parts of the mixture (sugar + water) is \(7 + 13 = 20\) parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water combined. Since the total parts of the mixture is 20, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total teaspoons by the total parts:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

Since the amount of sugar is 7 parts, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar by multiplying the value of one part by 7:
\[
\text{Teaspoons of sugar} = 7 \times 6 = 42
\]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is \(\boxed{42}\)."

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means that the number of vehicles brought in on the second day is:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23 \).

2. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is \( 40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming her salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her new salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.4 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each item and then calculate the total cost based on the quantities Dillon is buying.

1. **Cost of a Pepper:**
   - Given: Each pepper costs $15.

2. **Cost of a Watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon = \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.

3. **Cost of an Orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon.
   - Therefore, the cost of an orange = \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Dillon buys 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.
   - Cost of 4 watermelons = \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.
   - Cost of 20 peppers = \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.
   - Cost of 10 oranges = \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

5. **Total Amount Spent:**
   - Total cost = Cost of watermelons + Cost of peppers + Cost of oranges

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars are available. We know the total number of cars and the number of automatic and manual cars.

1. Total number of cars = 20
2. Number of automatic cars = 12
3. Number of manual cars = 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of the total number of cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is:

"Let's define the variables for the number of each type of bee:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B = 2Q \) into the equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ W + B + Q = 4Q + 2Q + Q = 7Q = 700. \]

Solving for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400. \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. The milk and eggs are food items.

The cost of the non-food items is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total cost of food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ clients} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths required. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, so for 8 clients:

\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles of bleach per client} = 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \]
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack of cloths per client} = 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the bleach and cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cloths costs $5, so:

\[ 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} = \$32 \]
\[ 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$40 \]

Adding these together gives the total expenses:

\[ \$32 + \$40 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of these cookies:

\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10 \text{ per cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so we need to find out how much change he receives after paying $6.00:

\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

Therefore, the change Carl receives is:

\[ \$4.00 \]"
"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's work backwards from the end to the beginning:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). Therefore, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate their 9 fries, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate its 7 fries, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate his 14 fries, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

Thus, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
  - Each day, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
  - Total hours per day: \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
  - Total hours for 3 days: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
  - Each day, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
  - Total hours per day: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
  - Total hours for 2 days: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from all five days to get the total weekly hours:
\[ 9 \text{ hours (MWF)} + 8 \text{ hours (TT)} = 17 \text{ hours per week} \]

Next, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[ \boxed{272} \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to feet for consistency, since the final answer is required in feet.

- Each roll is 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
- Each chocolate croissant is 6 inches long, so each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Next, we calculate the total length of each type of baked good in feet:

- For the rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- For the chocolate croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- For the baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Now, we add these lengths together to find the total length of all the baked goods end to end:

\[ 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods is \(\boxed{280}\) feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly banana requirement for each type of ape and then double that amount since the bananas are ordered every 2 months.

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas} \)

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas} \)

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas} \)

4. **Total Bananas for 2 Months:**
   - Sum of bananas for all apes: \( 400 \text{ bananas} + 800 \text{ bananas} + 200 \text{ bananas} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \)

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once covers a distance of \(100 \times 2 = 200\) yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:
\[
200 \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of \(40 \times 2 = 80\) yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[
80 \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distances they run is:
\[
3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."
"To determine how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the pens, notebooks, and bond paper he bought.

   - Each pen costs $1.5.
   - Total cost for pens = \( 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of Notebooks:**
   - Raphael bought 2 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs $4.
   - Total cost for notebooks = \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of Bond Paper:**
   - Raphael bought 1 rim of bond paper.
   - The bond paper costs $20.
   - Total cost for bond paper = \( 20 \) dollars.

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 6 \text{ (pens)} + 8 \text{ (notebooks)} + 20 \text{ (bond paper)} = 34 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Raphael spent is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. When 6 of them come out from under a lily pad, the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6. So, the number of tadpoles he can see now is \(11 + 6 = 17\). Then, when 2 of these tadpoles hide under a rock, the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2. Therefore, the number of tadpoles he can see now is \(17 - 2 = 15\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Depth on Monday**: The tank has a depth of 17 feet.

2. **Depth on Tuesday**: The depth increases by 7 feet.
   \[
   \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Depth on Wednesday**: The depth is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is **16 feet**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish each person caught.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

So, the total number of fish Anakin caught is:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

Next, let's determine how many fish Locsin caught:
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ starfish} \]
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ sea horses} \]
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ clownfish} \]

So, the total number of fish Locsin caught is:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

Now, we add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Calculation**:
   - The price increases by 20% every two months. A 20% increase means the price is multiplied by \(1 + \frac{20}{100} = 1.20\).

3. **Number of Increases**:
   - Since the price increases every two months, in 36 months, the number of increases is \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\).

4. **Final Price Calculation**:
   - The final price after 18 increases can be calculated using the formula for compound interest: \(P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n\), where \(P_0\) is the initial price, \(r\) is the rate of increase, and \(n\) is the number of periods.
   - Here, \(P_0 = 20\), \(r = 0.20\), and \(n = 18\).
   - Therefore, the final price \(P\) is:
     \[
     P = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

5. **Compute the Value**:
   - First, calculate \(1.20^{18}\):
     \[
     1.20^{18} \approx 39.366
     \]
   - Then, multiply by the initial price:
     \[
     P = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32
     \]

So, the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately \(\boxed{787.32}\)."

     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - There are 5 red cars, each costing $4:
     \[
     5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - There are 3 action figures, each costing $5:
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The doll costs $15.

5. **Summing Up the Total Cost:**
   - Adding the costs together:
     \[
     20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total value of all the toys is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. **Calculate the lost income from doing taxes herself:**
   - Jackie loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She will lose 3 hours of freelance work.
   - Therefore, the lost income is \( 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \).

2. **Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring an accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.
   - The lost income from doing her taxes herself is $105.

3. **Determine the net difference:**
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she will spend $90.
   - She would have lost $105 in income by doing her taxes herself.

Therefore, Jackie will have \(\boxed{15}\) dollars more if she hires the accountant."
"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Mouse: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, we sum up the costs of the items that are not included in the computer price:
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total additional cost = €157 + €74 + €102 = €333

Next, we add this total to the cost of the computer:
Total cost = €1090 + €333 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
Money left = €1500 - €1423 = €77

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
€77"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, the total number of eggs needed is:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Jimmy has based on the information given.

Ethel has $8. According to the problem, Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ \text{Jimmy's money} = 2 \times \text{Ethel's money} + 2 \]

Substituting the amount of money Ethel has into the equation:

\[ \text{Jimmy's money} = 2 \times 8 + 2 \]

Now, perform the multiplication and addition:

\[ \text{Jimmy's money} = 16 + 2 = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has $18.

Final answer:

"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time spent on peeling and cutting each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to find the total time for peeling and cutting all of them.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time for peeling all potatoes.**
- Time to peel one potato = 1.5 minutes
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes = 1.5 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes

**Step 2: Calculate the total time for cutting all potatoes.**
- Time to cut one potato = 5 seconds
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes = 5 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

**Step 3: Convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes.**
- 300 seconds = 300 / 60 = 5 minutes

**Step 4: Add the total time for peeling and cutting.**
- Total time for peeling = 90 minutes
- Total time for cutting = 5 minutes
- Total prep time = 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost of lemons and sugar.
   - The profit is given by the total revenue minus the total cost: \( \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - C \).
   - Therefore, \( 25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C \).

2. **Express the total revenue in terms of the number of glasses sold:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of glasses sold.
   - Each glass is sold for $0.50, so the total revenue is \( 0.50x \).

3. **Express the total cost in terms of the number of gallons made:**
   - Let \( g \) be the number of gallons made.
   - Each gallon costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is \( 5g \).

4. **Relate the number of glasses sold to the number of gallons made:**
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon, so \( x = 20g \).

5. **Substitute \( x \) and \( C \) into the profit equation:**
   - \( 25 = 0.50(20g) - 5g \).
   - Simplify the equation: \( 25 = 10g - 5g \).
   - \( 25 = 5g \).

6. **Solve for \( g \):**
   - \( g = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \).

7. **Calculate the total cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost of lemons is \( 3g = 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

The amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is \(\boxed{122}\)."
"To determine how much Lloyd earned over the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate his earnings for the first week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the first week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate his earnings for the second week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the second week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both weeks to find the total earnings:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings for the first week} + \text{Earnings for the second week} = 50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of \(\boxed{130}\) dollars for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is \(20\)."
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first establish the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

According to the problem, Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. The problem states that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as \( R \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Thus, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jan is 30 years old.
2. Jean is two years older than Mark. So, if Mark's age is \( M \), then Jean's age is \( M + 2 \).
3. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \). So, half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \). Therefore, two years ago, Mark's age was \( 14 + 5 = 19 \). This means that Mark's current age is \( 19 + 2 = 21 \).

Now, we know Mark's current age is 21. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age is \( 21 + 2 = 23 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds.
\[
\text{Total time for the faster team} = 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Slower Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one.
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds
- Third runner: \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds
- Fourth runner: \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds

\[
\text{Total time for the slower team} = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Difference in Time:**
\[
\text{Difference} = 222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

The faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:

\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in probabilities
Now, we find the difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:

\[ \text{Difference} = P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

### Step 4: Convert the difference to a percentage
To express the difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

### Final Answer
Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row."
"Jenna's mother picked 20 apples. Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, which means Jenna picked \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) apples.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mother's apples:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

So, they both picked 30 apples in total."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed among all small rodents is 160 pieces.
   - Straw for hamsters = 50 pieces.
   - Straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.
   - Straw for rats = \(160 - 50 - 20 = 90\) pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats and the straw each rat gets:**
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \(r\) be the number of rats.
   - Total straw for rats = \(6r = 90\).
   - Solving for \(r\), we get \(r = \frac{90}{6} = 15\).

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Number of rats per cage = \(\frac{15}{3} = 5\).

The number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the compounded interest over these months.

The initial amount Mandy owes is $100. The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal as 0.02.

The formula for the amount after \( n \) months with monthly compounding interest is:
\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount after \( n \) months,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate,
- \( n \) is the number of months.

Plugging in the values:
\[ P = 100 \]
\[ r = 0.02 \]
\[ n = 3 \]

So, the amount after 3 months is:
\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]

Calculating \( (1.02)^3 \):
\[ (1.02)^3 = 1.061208 \]

Therefore:
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict is:
\[ \boxed{106.12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost to buy each bag is $20, and the cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the number of bags the trader sold is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine how many peaches John collects, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends collecting peaches.
2. Determine how many peaches he collects per minute.

First, we know that John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total number of minutes as follows:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock.
2. Convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For a flock of ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly requirement by 7:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. Therefore, the net increase in the number of trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards Collected in the First Month:**
   She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Cards Collected in the Second Month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

4. **Cards Collected in the Third Month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

5. **Total Number of Cards:**
   Now, we sum up all the cards she had initially and the cards she collected over the three months.

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A per sentence. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

For 500 sentences from Publisher B, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in total in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:

\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

1. **Cheese used for sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for sandwiches is:
     \[
     2 \text{ slices/sandwich} \times 7 \text{ sandwiches} = 14 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices per omelet.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for omelets is:
     \[
     3 \text{ slices/omelet} \times 3 \text{ omelets} = 9 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for macaroni and cheese is:

   - Therefore, the total weight of the candied apples is:
     \[
     \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:**
   - The total weight is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples.
   - Therefore, the total weight is:
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams}
     \]

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is \(\boxed{2600}\) grams."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we need to find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days. We do this by adding the number of cakes bought each day:

\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76
\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates (which is 6 plates) would cost:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \text{ dollars} \]

Since twenty dozen cups is equal to \(24 \times 20 = 480\) cups, the cost per cup is:
\[ \frac{34800}{480} = 72.5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ \boxed{72.5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Let \(x\) be the number of times she mows the lawn. She earns $4 each time, so she earns \(4x\) dollars from mowing the lawn.
- Sara already has $10 saved.

The total amount of money Sara will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn is the sum of her savings, her earnings from babysitting, and her earnings from mowing the lawn:
\[10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[30 + 4x \geq 70\]

To find \(x\), we solve the inequality:
\[4x \geq 70 - 30\]
\[4x \geq 40\]
\[x \geq 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. The number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The eggs produced by the red chickens and the white chickens can be expressed as:
- Red chickens produce \( 3r \) eggs a day.
- White chickens produce \( 5w \) eggs a day.

Since the total number of eggs collected each day is 42, we can write the equation:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has \( r = 4 \) red chickens. To verify, if \( r = 4 \), then \( w = r + 2 = 6 \). The total number of eggs produced would be:
\[ 3 \times 4 + 5 \times 6 = 12 + 30 = 42 \]
This confirms our solution is correct.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a constant speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends \(\boxed{5}\) hours walking."
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers on the first day.
   - Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day.

2. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
   - The second day had 50 more customers than the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is \(100 + 50 = 150\).

3. Let the number of customers on the third day be \(x\).

4. According to the problem, the total number of customers over the three days is 500.
   - This can be expressed as the sum of the customers from each day: \(100 + 150 + x = 500\).

5. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   x = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   x = 250
   \]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons and the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that currently, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 each month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of dahlias in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The total points scored by the four students is 251.
2. Naomi scored 68 points.
3. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

First, calculate the points scored by Yuri:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri's points: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Next, calculate the points scored by Brianna:
- Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
- Total points: 251
- Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)

So, Jojo's points are:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Jojo scored 54 points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent solving puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on Sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, we calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one Sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 Sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on Sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles to find the total time spent:
- Total time spent = time on crossword puzzles + time on Sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is \(\boxed{70}\) minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank to water her garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount of water left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater she collected:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is \(\boxed{90}\) liters."
"First, let's determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, the number of petunias is calculated as follows:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, Andy plants 50 petunias. Now, to find the total number of flowers he plants, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

\[ 90 + 50 = 140 \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, it spends a third of $15000 on advertising, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{15000}{3} = 5000
\]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising in the second year. To find the total amount spent on advertising over the two years, we add the amounts spent each year:

\[
15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is \(\boxed{20000}\)."
"To determine the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

Thus, the total amount Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals, altogether, is \(\boxed{180}\)."
"To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the trip and then sum them up.

   - It takes 6 days to travel by bus.

2. **Travel by car from Rochester back to New Jersey:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus.
   - Therefore, the travel time by car is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

3. **Total travel time:**
   - Add the time taken for both legs of the trip: \( 6 \) days (bus) + \( 3 \) days (car) = \( 9 \) days.

"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of Pokemon card James has after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 (initial) + 14 (bought) = 34
- Water type: 40 (initial) - 8 (lost) = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has now:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. This is calculated by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{3200}{96} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest integer, we get:
\[ 33 \]

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"Let's break down the cost of Chad's burrito order step by step:

1. **Base burrito**: $6.50
2. **Extra meat**: $2.00
3. **Extra cheese**: $1.00
4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **2 sauces**: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. **Upgrade for chips and a drink**: $3.00

First, we add up all the individual costs:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, which he uses at checkout. So, we subtract this from the total:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the final amount Chad still owes is:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

**Final Answer:**
1"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps and calculate the number of watermelons at each stage.

1. **Initial number of watermelons**: 120

2. **Watermelons ready for harvest after two months**: 30% of 120
   \[
   0.30 \times 120 = 36
   \]
   So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

3. **Remaining watermelons after two months**: 
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]

4. **Watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks**: 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63
   \]
   So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

5. **Remaining watermelons after harvesting**: 
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To determine the total cost Mark pays for the fleet of cars, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   The tax rate is 10%, so the tax on the cars is:
   \[
   \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
   \]

3. **Registration fees:**
   The registration fee for each car is $1,000, and there are 12 cars.
   \[
   \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000
   \]

4. **Total cost:**
   Adding the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees gives:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
   \]

Thus, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:
\[
\boxed{276000}

"First, let's determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. According to the problem, Robert collected 20 shells on Monday, and Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert. Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday is:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. The problem states that on Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. This means she collected 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday. So, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Thus, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Given that Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden, and there were 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs together:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining how many penguins jump in the ocean and how many go into the cave.

1. **Total number of penguins**: 36

2. **Penguins that jump in the ocean**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

3. **Penguins that go into the cave**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

4. **Penguins still sunbathing**:
   \[
   36 - 12 - 12 = 12

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's determine how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tomatoes Steve and his girlfriend eat together per day:

\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week:

\[ 9 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is:

\[ \frac{63}{3} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs \(\boxed{21}\) vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

First, we calculate the total number of slices needed. John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order \(\boxed{10}\) pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens. These are all full pens initially.

2. **First Cycle of Refilling**:
   - When Ram uses up the ink in these 25 pens, he will have 25 empty pens.
   - By mixing the ink from 5 empty pens, he can make 1 full pen. Therefore, from 25 empty pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) full pens.
   - After making these 5 new full pens, he will have 20 empty pens left (since he used 25 empty pens to make 5 new full pens).

3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**:
   - Now, Ram has 5 new full pens and 20 empty pens. He can mix the ink from 5 of these 20 empty pens to make 1 more full pen.
   - After making this 1 new full pen, he will have 15 empty pens left.

4. **Third Cycle of Refilling**:
   - Now, Ram has 6 full pens (5 from the first cycle and 1 from the second cycle) and 15 empty pens. He can mix the ink from 5 of these 15 empty pens to make 1 more full pen.
   - After making this 1 new full pen, he will have 10 empty pens left.

5. **Fourth Cycle of Refilling**:
   - Now, Ram has 7 full pens (6 from the previous cycles and 1 from this cycle) and 10 empty pens. He can mix the ink from 5 of these 10 empty pens to make 1 more full pen.
   - After making this 1 new full pen, he will have 5 empty pens left.

6. **Fifth Cycle of Refilling**:
   - Now, Ram has 8 full pens (7 from the previous cycles and 1 from this cycle) and 5 empty pens. He can mix the ink from these 5 empty pens to make 1 more full pen.
   - After making this 1 new full pen, he will have 0 empty pens left.

7. **Final Count**:
   - After all the cycles, Ram will have 9 full pens (8 from the previous cycles and 1 from the last cycle).

"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Determine the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Determine the number of students who went out through exit C by subtracting the students who went out through exits A and B from the total number of students.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit A} = 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. **Determine the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

4. **Determine the number of students who went out through exit C:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit C} = \text{Remaining students} - \text{Students who went out through exit B} = 700 - 420 = 280
   \]

Thus, the number of students who went out through exit C is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

1. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).
2. According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert. Since John has 54 candies, we can write:
   \[
   2R = 54
   \]
3. Solving for \( R \):
   \[
   R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]
   So, Robert has 27 candies.
4. James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, the number of candies James has is:
   \[
   R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
   \]
5. Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies, so the difference is:
   \[
   54 - 33 = 21
   \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike is still writing to:**
   Mike originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Therefore, he is still writing to:
   \[
   5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of letters Mike receives per week:**
   Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week. Therefore, the total number of letters Mike receives per week is:
   \[
   3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} = 6 \text{ letters per week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pages Mike writes in response:**
   Each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in response is:
   \[
   6 \text{ letters} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages per week}
   \]

4. **Determine the time it takes for Mike to write one page:**
   Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Mike spends writing per week:**
   The total time in minutes is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 180 \text{ minutes per week}
   \]

6. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
   \[
   \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours per week}
   \]

Therefore, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:
\[

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries.
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 24 - 5 = 19
   \]

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 19 - 10 = 9
   \]

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \(x\) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   9 + x \text{ fries}
   \]

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x
   \]

6. **Final number of fries Griffin had:**
   We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries.
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]

7. **Solving for \(x\):**
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the selling price, the transfer fees, the brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount.

1. **Selling Price of the House:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \$400,000
   \]

2. **Transfer Fees:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fees} = 3\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = \$12,000
   \]

3. **Brokerage Fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = \$20,000
   \]

4. **Remaining Loan Amount:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Loan Amount} = \$250,000
   \]

5. **Total Expenses:**
   \[
   \text{Total Expenses} = \text{Transfer Fees} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Remaining Loan Amount} = \$12,000 + \$20,000 + \$250,000 = \$282,000
   \]

6. **Net Proceeds:**
   \[
   \text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Expenses} = \$400,000 - \$282,000 = \$118,000
   \]

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:
\[
\boxed{118000}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Time taken: 20 minutes

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - The time taken to heat from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is 40% longer than the time to heat from room temperature to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - Time to heat to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
   - Time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
   - Total heating time: \(20 + 28 = 48\) minutes

4. **Cooking time:**
   - The cooking time is 5 minutes less than the total heating time.
   - Cooking time: \(48 - 5 = 43\) minutes

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
   - Total time: Heating time + Cooking time
   - Total time: \(48 + 43 = 91\) minutes

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is **91 minutes**."
"To determine the total amount spent by the real estate agent on the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- The agent bought 50 newspaper ads.

\[
\text{Cost of newspaper ads} = 50 \text{ ads} \times 5 \text{ dollars/ad} = 250 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- The agent bought 15 television ads.

\[
\text{Cost of television ads} = 15 \text{ ads} \times 75 \text{ dollars/ad} = 1125 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 250 \text{ dollars} + 1125 \text{ dollars} = 1375 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the real estate agent spent a total of \(\boxed{1375}\) dollars on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) blue golf balls.

Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms from all three bags to find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought:

\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is \(\boxed{762}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bedroom Windows:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows per house due to bedrooms is \(3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}\).
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 6 \text{ windows/house} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows for 2 houses is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows/house} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - Adding the bedroom windows and the additional windows together, we get \(12 \text{ bedroom windows} + 8 \text{ additional windows} = 20 \text{ windows}\).

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the change the mother receives, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought. The items and their costs are as follows:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Adding these amounts together:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The mother pays with $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is:

\[ \boxed{5.00} \]"
"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then use the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches for the sleeves.

1. **Calculate the number of stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches of the body of the sweater.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the body and the collar and rosette:**
   The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the body} = 900
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for the body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 270 = 1170
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the two sleeves:**
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the two sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of stitches for each sleeve:**
   Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

The number of stitches each sleeve takes is \(\boxed{315}\)."
"To determine how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds:
- Number of tomato seed packets: 20
- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40
\[
\text{Total cost for tomato seeds} = 20 \times 40 = 800
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the celery seeds:
- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30
\[
\text{Total cost for celery seeds} = 80 \times 30 = 2400
\]

Now, we add the two amounts to find the total expenditure:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 800 + 2400 = 3200
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is:
\[
\boxed{3200}
\]"
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part of his performance and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{138}

1. **Total Cards**: Carly had 80 cards.

2. **Cards with the letter A**: 
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \text{ of } 80 = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Remaining Cards after A**: 
   \[
   80 - 32 = 48 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Cards with the letter B**: 
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 48 = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \text{ cards}

5. **Remaining Cards after B**: 
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ cards}
   \]

6. **Cards with the letter C**: 
   \[
   \frac{5}{8} \text{ of } 24 = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \text{ cards}
   \]

7. **Remaining Cards after C**: 
   \[
   24 - 15 = 9 \text{ cards}
   \]

So, the number of cards with the letter D is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"First, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the small holes. Since it takes him 3 minutes to dig one small hole, for 30 small holes, the time spent is:
\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time spent digging the large holes. Since it takes him 10 minutes to dig one large hole, for 15 large holes, the time spent is:
\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both small and large holes to get the total time in minutes:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 30.

**Explanation:**
- Currently, the sum of their ages is 20.
- In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older.
- Therefore, the total additional age for both of them combined will be \(10 + 10 = 20\) years.
- Adding this to their current total age: \(20 + 20 = 30\).

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 30."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 3S = 18 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Sam is 6 years old."
"To determine the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the popsicles:
Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each.
\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \]
So, the cost of the popsicles is $5.

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.
\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \]
So, the cost of the ice cream bars is $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is \(\boxed{7}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba as follows:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots, so the total number of spots for all the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Similarly, there are 60 mambas and each mamba has 35 spots, so the total number of spots for all the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes in the park:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game. There are 12 team members and each brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is \(12 \times 2 = 24\). Adding the 12 team members and 3 coaches, the total number of people is \(12 + 24 + 3 = 39\).

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, the number of pizzas needed is \(\frac{39}{3} = 13\).

Finally, if each pizza costs $15, the total cost for 13 pizzas is \(13 \times 15 = 195\).

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."

1. Calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week.
2. Sum the stories written in both weeks for each person.
3. Add the totals for all three individuals.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week.**

- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. In the second week, she doubled this amount:
  \[
  20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ stories}
  \]

- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week. In the second week, he doubled this amount:
  \[
  40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ stories}
  \]

- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week. In the second week, she doubled this amount:
  \[
  60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ stories}
  \]

**Step 2: Sum the stories written in both weeks for each person.**

- Alani's total:
  \[
  20 + 40 = 60 \text{ stories}
  \]

- Braylen's total:
  \[
  40 + 80 = 120 \text{ stories}
  \]

- Margot's total:
  \[
  60 + 120 = 180 \text{ stories}
  \]

**Step 3: Add the totals for all three individuals.**

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the 76-star flag, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of stars (76) to find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows.
3. Divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows.

Let's start with step 1:
- The three rows of 8 stars contain \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars.
- The two rows of 6 stars contain \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars.
- Therefore, the total number of stars in these five rows is \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars.

Next, step 2:
- Subtract the 36 stars from the total 76 stars to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows: \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight for 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Since the result is a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, the number of trucks needed is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate Izzy's medals as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we find the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals of Ali and Izzy} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together. Let \( M \) be the total number of medals given out. Then:

\[ M = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ bars per packet} = 40 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars per adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Subtract the number of bars the adults get from the total number of bars to find out how many bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we need to distribute these 16 bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bars per child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. 

Final answer:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes because Susan's earnings are calculated in 10-minute intervals:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Susan earns for the online task is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

1. **Mike's points**: Mike has 21 points.
2. **Jim's points**: Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
3. **Tony's points**: Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to check if each player has over 20 points to see if they get an extra point in the fourth round:

1. **Mike**: Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
2. **Jim**: Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim's total remains 18 points.
3. **Tony**: Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

So, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is:

\[
\boxed{83}
\]"
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

Now, we find the total number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will originally bought 15 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of washed oranges from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is \(\boxed{3}\)."

**Total Squats:**
50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90

**Total Dumbbell presses:**
20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

Finally, we sum up all the activities:
220 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = 370

The total count of the activities he's done in the two days is **370**."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily rice consumption for the household:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 members in the household.
   - They eat rice at lunch and dinner, which means 2 meals per day.

   Therefore, the daily consumption is:
   \[
   5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - The total amount of rice is 42 kg.
   - The daily consumption is 2 kg.

   Therefore, the number of days the rice will last is:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ kg/day}} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Convert the number of days into weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

   Therefore, the number of weeks the rice will last is:
   \[
   \frac{21 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
3 \text{ weeks}
\]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the crates sold each day:
- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Now, we sum these amounts:
\[ 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by \(\boxed{55}\) crates from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sequence of bids and sum them up.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen accepts the opening bid of $200.
2. **First Other Bidder**: The bid rises by $50, so the first other bidder bids $200 + $50 = $250.
3. **Carmen's First Bid**: Carmen bids $250 + $50 = $300.
4. **Second Other Bidder**: The bid rises by another $50, so the second other bidder bids $300 + $50 = $350.
5. **Carmen's Second Bid**: Carmen bids $350 + $50 = $400.
6. **Third Other Bidder**: The bid rises by another $50, so the third other bidder bids $400 + $50 = $450.
7. **Carmen's Final Bid**: Carmen bids $450 + $50 = $500 and wins the auction.

Now, we sum up all the bids Carmen made:
- First bid: $300
- Second bid: $400
- Final bid: $500

Total cost = $300 + $400 + $500 = $1200

Thus, the desk costs Carmen \(\boxed{1200}\) dollars."
"To calculate the total annual cost for John's driving service, we need to break down the costs into several components and then sum them up.

1. **Daily Miles Driven:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so he drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, totaling 60 miles per day.

2. **Weekly Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 60 miles per day and works 5 days a week, so he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles per week.

3. **Annual Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 300 miles per week and works 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles per year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - John is charged $2 per mile. Therefore, the cost for the miles driven in a year is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total annual bonus is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

6. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Adding the cost for the miles driven and the annual bonus, the total annual cost is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is **$31,800**."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday is:
\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the folding process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, can produce two pages (one on the front and one on the back).

Given that a 32-page tabloid is made by folding a single piece of paper in half, we can deduce the following:

1. When a single piece of paper is folded in half, it produces 2 pages.
2. To have 32 pages, we need to determine how many such halves are required.

Since each piece of paper folded in half produces 2 pages, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2 \times \text{number of pieces of paper} = 32 \]

Solving for the number of pieces of paper:
\[ \text{number of pieces of paper} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \]

Therefore, 16 pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid.

"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the amount left after spending on rides is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annika has left is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Let's break down the information given and calculate the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year.

1. **Total books in the collection**: 250 books.
2. **Books sold this year**: 45 books.
3. **Books remaining unsold**: 50 books.
4. **Books sold in the first year**: Since there are 50 unsold books now and 45 sold this year, the number of books sold in the first year is \(250 - 50 - 45 = 155\) books.
5. **Books sold in the first year compared to the current year**: The problem states that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. This is consistent with \(155 = 2 \times 45 - 5\), but we'll use the direct calculation for clarity.

Now, we need to find out how many books were sold in the second year. The total books sold over the three years is \(155 + 45 + \text{books sold in the second year} = 250 - 50 = 200\). Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is \(200 - 155 - 45 = 0\).

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is \(0 \times 20 = 0\).

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is \(\boxed{0}\)."
"First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage. Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of:

\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ hours/week} \]

At a rate of $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

\[ 50 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of weeks in April. April typically has 4 weeks. Therefore, Watson's total earnings for April are:

\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$3200 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3200} \]"
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled a total of 20 people, the number of people he lost to is the total number of people minus the number of people he beat:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning. So, we calculate:

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40
\]

This means that after the morning sales, the number of loaves left is:

\[
60 - 40 = 20
\]

Next, we need to find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. According to the problem, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, we calculate half of the remaining 20 loaves:

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
\]

Thus, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate the weekly weight loss for Joey as follows:

\[ \text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Therefore, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, which is the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks.

Since Sandy loses weight at a rate that allows her to lose 2 pounds per 4 weeks, we can calculate the total weeks required for Sandy to lose 8 pounds as follows:

\[ \text{Sandy's total weeks to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \times 2 = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 8 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:

- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Now, let's calculate the savings on the milk:

- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5

Next, we calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:

- Total savings on ice cream: 2 tubs * $2/tub = $4
- Total savings on milk: 4 packets * $0.5/packet = $2

Finally, we add the savings from both items to get the total savings:

- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

So, you will save a total of $6."
"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is calculated by dividing 15 by 3:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is calculated by dividing 15 by 5:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (total new limbs)}
     \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each:
\[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 suitcases. Each suitcase costs $50:
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times the cost of a business suit is:
\[ 5 \times 100 = 500 \]
Adding $700 to this amount gives the cost of the flight ticket:
\[ 500 + 700 = 1200 \]

The total amount Theo has initially is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he can spend on other items is:
\[ 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ 600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is the total amount he can spend minus the total cost of the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ 4000 - 1950 = 2050 \]

Thus, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each per day, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each per day, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the total number of eggs consumed per day by the family is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, over the course of a week (7 days), the family will consume \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To determine Trent's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know Quinn's age is 30.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, Jane's age is:
   \[
   30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Therefore, Trent's age is:
   \[
   27 + 5 = 32
   \]

So, Trent is \(\boxed{32}\) years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago, so his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago, so the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited to her party.

- She invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is:
\[12 + 12 = 24\]

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments.

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\]

Therefore, the number of people who actually show up is:
\[24 - 10 = 14\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Marbles bought from Johanna:**
   Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.

2. **Initial marbles in the store:**
   The store already had 50 marbles.

3. **Total marbles before receiving from his father:**
   \[
   50 \text{ (initial marbles)} + 20 \text{ (bought from Johanna)} = 70 \text{ marbles}
   \]

4. **Marbles given by his father:**
   His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ marbles}
   \]

5. **Total marbles after receiving from his father:**
   \[
   70 \text{ (previous total)} + 8 \text{ (from his father)} = 78 \text{ marbles}

"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. This can be represented as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = 26 \]

Since the number of loose pencils is 2, the number of pencils in the boxes is:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Jam has 26 pencils in total. Meg has 46 pencils. To find out the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together, we add their pencils:

\[ \text{Total pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold the same number of pencils as the boxes Jam originally had (which is 24 pencils per box), we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{24} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes added:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   \[
   \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   \[
   \text{Weakening effect of ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.
   \[
   \text{Weakening effect of cream} = 15 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   Add the weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream.
   \[
   \text{Total weakening effect} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the trade ratio and the outcome of the trades.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

Since each new record requires 2 old records, for 7 new records, the total number of old records given up is:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[
2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
\]

Thus, the total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Adding the total payments to both junior and senior programmers gives us the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

\[
\text{Total monthly payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[
\boxed{224000}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Lollipops**: Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. **Lollipops Eaten on the Way to School**: He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]
3. **Lollipops Given to Friends**: He gives 14 lollipops to his friends.
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
4. **Lollipops Bought on the Way Home**: He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave 14 lollipops to his friends, he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
   Adding these to the remaining lollipops:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
5. **Lollipops Eaten Later**: He eats 3 more lollipops that night and 2 more in the morning.
   \[
   36 - 3 - 2 = 31
   \]

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is:
\[
\boxed{31}

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the number of percentage points that need to be charged. The phone needs to go from 60% to 100%, which is a difference of:

\[ 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

Next, we know that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to find out how many minutes it will take to recharge 40 percentage points, we multiply the number of percentage points by the time it takes to recharge one percentage point:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"

   \]
3. Erin then gives 3 lollipops to Ella. So, the number of lollipops Erin has left is:
   \[
   17 - 3 = 14
   \]

Therefore, the final number of lollipops Erin has left is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used the $4 reward. However, they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of the rewards off the price. So, the coupon took \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars off the price.

The total amount after applying the reward and the coupon is:

\[ 43 - 4 - 8 = 31 \]

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

**Job A:**
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Taxes: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

**Job B:**
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Taxes: $36,000 * 10% = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs to determine which job pays more and by how much.

**Net pay comparison:**
- Job A: $24,000
- Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B)."
"First, we calculate the number of ruined castles in Scotland. Given that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins, we can find this number by calculating 40% of 220:

\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. Therefore, we calculate half of 88:

\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]

Thus, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44.

\[
\boxed{44}

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To determine how many paintball guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to find the total number of guns they have combined.

The total number of guns is calculated as follows:
- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- Richard (RJ) has 1 gun.
- Richard (Richard) has 5 guns.

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of guns by the number of people to find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally. There are 4 people in total.

So, we divide 24 by 4:
\[ 24 \div 4 = 6 \]

Therefore, if they were to share their guns equally, each of them would have \(\boxed{6}\) guns."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Therefore, for 8 batches, the sugar needed is \( 8 \times 30 = 240 \) ounces.

Next, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Therefore, for 1 batch, the sugar needed is \( 1 \times 70 = 70 \) ounces.

Now, add the amounts of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

Thus, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

"First, let's calculate the value of Maria's shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each.

Initial value of shares = 8 shares * $8/share = $64

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%.

Value of shares after first year = $64 * (1 + 50/100) = $64 * 1.50 = $96

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%.

Value of shares after second year = $96 * (1 - 25/100) = $96 * 0.75 = $72

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is $72."
"First, let's determine how many hot dogs each person ate:

1. Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
2. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(3 \times 2 = 6\) hot dogs.
3. John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(\frac{6}{2} = 3\) hot dogs.

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. John ate 3 hot dogs and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, so the difference is \(3 - 2 = 1\).

Therefore, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Since the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the larger groups, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students in the class is 200, and the class is split into three groups. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

1. \( C + H = 60 \)
2. \( H = 2C \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to find the number of cows:

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting \( C \) back into the second equation:

\[ H = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, there are 20 cows and 40 chickens. Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

The total number of legs the animals have, all together, is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Josh starts by juggling 3 balls.
2. Each week, he adds 1 ball to his juggling act.
3. The talent show is in 4 weeks, so by the end of the fourth week, he will have added 4 balls in total (1 ball per week for 4 weeks).

So, the number of balls Josh can juggle at the end of the fourth week is:
\[ 3 \text{ (initial balls)} + 4 \text{ (balls added over 4 weeks)} = 7 \text{ balls} \]

4. During the performance, Josh drops 3 balls. Since 2 of them are caught and 1 is lost, he is left with:
\[ 7 \text{ (initial balls)} - 3 \text{ (dropped balls)} = 4 \text{ balls} \]
\[ 4 \text{ (remaining balls)} - 1 \text{ (lost ball)} = 3 \text{ balls} \]

Therefore, the final number of balls Josh starts juggling on stage is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad. Therefore, the blue beetle and the green toad each weigh 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Therefore, the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. Therefore, the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself. The weights of the animals are:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Adding these weights together, we get:
\[50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 \text{ pounds}\]

Including the weight of the container, which is 20 pounds, the total weight is:
\[240 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds}\]

Thus, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is \(\boxed{260}\)."

2. At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits that her friend gave her. Therefore, she received \(2 \times 24 = 48\) new baby outfits.
3. Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

Now, we add all these amounts together:

\[
24 + 48 + 15
\]

First, add 24 and 48:

\[
24 + 48 = 72
\]

Next, add 15 to the result:

\[
72 + 15 = 87

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:

- They now sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from tractors to silos. The formula to calculate the percentage increase is:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.1 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now."

"First, let's break down the time John spent on each activity:

1. **Boating**: John spent 6 hours boating.
2. **Swimming**: He spent half the time he spent boating swimming, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.
3. **Watching Shows**: He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours watching shows.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one person} = \$5 + \$20 = \$25
   \]

4. **Cost for Morgan herself:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Morgan} = \$25
   \]

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Morgan and friends} = \text{Cost for Morgan} + \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Budget for the party:**
   \[
   \text{Budget} = \$90
   \]

8. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

9. **Cost for each friend (excluding arcade tokens, as Morgan already has $5 for herself):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for each friend} = \$25
   \]

10. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
    \[
    \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost for each friend}} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4
    \]

Since Morgan cannot invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. Therefore, the total cost of lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa has left after buying the lollipops each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the amount she saves each day is:

\[ \$5 - \$1 = \$4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she will save:

\[ \$4 \text{ per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = \$20 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after 5 days is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Billy has after buying the candy:**
   - Billy starts with $10.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy he buys.
   - The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is \( 1.5x \).
   - After buying the candy, the amount of money left is \( 10 - 1.5x \).

2. **Calculate the amount of money spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy takes half of his remaining money to buy gumballs.
   - The amount of money he takes is \( \frac{10 - 1.5x}{2} \).
   - Each gumball costs $0.05, and he buys 40 gumballs, so the total cost of the gumballs is \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{10 - 1.5x}{2} = 2 \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   \frac{10 - 1.5x}{2} = 2
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   10 - 1.5x = 4
   \]
   Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   -1.5x = 4 - 10
   \]
   Simplify the right side:
   \[
   -1.5x = -6
   \]
   Divide both sides by -1.5:
   \[
   x = \frac{-6}{-1.5} = 4
   \]

So, Billy bought \(\boxed{4}\) pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \) years.

According to the problem, Carver is 45 years old, which is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is \(\boxed{25}\) years old."
"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
2. The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
3. The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs. The combined distance of the first two legs is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days the train goes between services, we divide 18,000 miles by the daily travel distance of 900 miles:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

Therefore, the train goes between services every \(\boxed{20}\) days."
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. According to the problem, a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

\[
3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing required:

\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:

\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each segment of the trip and then sum these times.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Distance: 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time: \(\frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time: \(\frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

Now, we add the times for both segments to find the total time of the trip:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time John spent on his trip is \(\boxed{6}\) hours."

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points.
2. Use the information that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points, to find out how many points Erin has after scoring.
3. Subtract the points Erin scored from her current total to find out how many points she had before.

First, we know that Sara scored 8 points. According to the problem, Erin now has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, Erin's current points are:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Erin scored 14 points to reach her current total. So, to find out how many points Erin had before scoring these 14 points, we subtract 14 from her current total:
\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, Erin had \(\boxed{10}\) points before scoring 14 points."
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses step by step.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - Additional cost for etching each frame is 20% of $20.
   - Etching cost per frame = \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Total cost per frame = \( 20 + 4 = 24 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for 44 seniors = \( 44 \times 24 = 1056 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - Total cost for pins = \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers = \( \frac{44}{4} = 11 \).
   - Each officer receives a cord that costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = \( 11 \times 12 = 132 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Sum of all costs = Cost of picture frames + Cost of pins + Cost of cords.

2. The DIY approach saves 20% of the original cost.

First, calculate 20% of $400:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making the wallpaper himself.

Next, subtract the savings from the original cost:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper is:
\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"Let's break down the sales day by day and account for the returns at the end.

1. **Friday Sales:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
   - Each pair consists of 2 shoes.
   - Therefore, on Friday, the store sold \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) shoes.

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   - The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday.
   - Therefore, on Saturday, the store sold \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.
   - Converting pairs to shoes, \( 28 \times 2 = 56 \) shoes.

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   - The store sold one-half the amount of shoes sold on Saturday.
   - Therefore, on Sunday, the store sold \( \frac{56}{2} = 28 \) pairs.
   - Converting pairs to shoes, \( 28 \times 2 = 56 \) shoes.

4. **Total Sales Before Returns:**
   - Adding up the sales from Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:
     \[
     28 \text{ (Friday)} + 56 \text{ (Saturday)} + 56 \text{ (Sunday)} = 140 \text{ shoes}
     \]

5. **Accounting for Returns:**
   - On the last day, 6 pairs of shoes were returned.
   - Each pair consists of 2 shoes.
   - Therefore, 6 pairs returned means \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) shoes were returned.

6. **Final Total Sales:**
   - Subtracting the returned shoes from the total sales:
     \[
     140 - 12 = 128 \text{ shoes}
     \]

Thus, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is \(\boxed{128}\)."

So, the number of cookies left for Rachel is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest on the loan. The interest rate is 10% per year, and the loan period is five months. Since the interest rate is annual, we need to find the interest for five months. The formula for simple interest is:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is \(\frac{5}{12}\) years (since five months is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year).

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times \frac{0.10 \times 5}{12} = 3650 \times \frac{0.5}{12} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{24} = \frac{3650}{24} \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total interest is approximately $152.08. Now, we add this interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan has to pay:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Karan has to pay this total amount over five months, so we divide the total amount by 5 to find the monthly payment:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay \(\boxed{760.42}\) per month."
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's hiking speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Cho's hiking time: 8 hours

The distance Cho hiked is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Cho}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's hiking speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Chloe's hiking time: 5 hours

The distance Chloe hiked is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Chloe}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked \(\boxed{67}\) kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel. Since Axel has 50 silver pesos, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel. Since Axel has 80 gold pesos, Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

- The total number of silver pesos they have together is \(50 + 100 = 150\).
- The total number of gold pesos they have together is \(80 + 120 = 200\).

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the overall total number of pesos.

- The total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

Thus, the total number of pesos they have together is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the total cost of the supplies. The cost is given as $18. Therefore, the profit from selling all the lemonade is:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how much land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.
2. According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.
3. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
   \]
5. Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
   \]

So, Mr. Ruther originally had \(\boxed{32}\) hectares of land."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26 \]

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform.

On the day of the performance, half of the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:

- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives him 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride:

- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36\).

Now, let's compare the total costs:

- David's total cost with the bracelet: $30.
- Dasha's total cost with individual tickets: $36.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:

\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

So, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap. She has:

- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

Adding these together gives us the total number of gifts:

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to make a bow for each of the 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have, which is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 6 = 11\).

Given that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can determine the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15
\]

Next, we calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[
90 - 75 = 15
\]

Thus, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost without the bundle discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling these services. The discount amount is:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable subscription, which is $60 per month. The savings by cancelling the cable subscription and getting the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. Again, since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices given away:
\[ 4 \text{ slices (to Bill)} + 3 \text{ slices (to Mark)} = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we subtract these from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 \text{ slices} - 7 \text{ slices} - 2 \text{ slices} = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"First, let's determine the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, he will use the air conditioner for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is the difference between the original and reduced usage:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras.

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ stripes}
   \]

2. She also counts a zebra with 36 stripes:
   \[
   36 \text{ stripes}
   \]

3. Another zebra has half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes:
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ stripes}
   \]

Next, we sum the total number of stripes:
\[
34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \text{ stripes}
\]

Now, we count the total number of zebras:
\[
2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ zebras}

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   Each sandwich serves 4 people. There are 20 people in total.
   \[
   \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   \[
   \text{Total pounds of meat} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total pounds of cheese} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
   \[

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cannolis:**
   Allan initially has 40 cannolis.

2. **Number of Corns Initially:**
   According to the problem, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, the number of corns initially is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]

3. **Additional Cannolis:**
   Allan bought 60 more cannolis. So, the new total number of cannolis is:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]

4. **Additional Corns:**
   Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ corns}
   \]
   Therefore, the new total number of corns is:
   \[
   80 + 20 = 100 \text{ corns}
   \]

5. **Combined Total:**
   The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is:
   \[
   100 \text{ cannolis} + 100 \text{ corns} = 200

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to leave 10 minutes before the 60-minute mark:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will be:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

**Final Answer:**

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for May = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week
   \[
   \text{Total payment for May} = 40 \times 15 \times 40 = 24000
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of employees remaining in June:**
   - Number of employees who left in June: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \(40 - 10 = 30\)

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Number of employees in June: 30
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for June = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means that for 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since 1/2 off of $3 is $1.50).

So, the total cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

3. **Total apples gathered by both:**
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne: \( 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \).
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne's sister: \( 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \).
   - Combined total: \( 45 + x + 105 = 150 + x \).

4. **Given that the combined total is 500 apples:**
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 500 - 150 = 350
   \]

So, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances he traveled each segment of the trip and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - He traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \).

3. **The 7th day:**
   - He did not travel at all.
   - Distance for the 7th day: \( 0 \, \text{km} \).

4. **Second week (days 8 to 14):**
   - He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[
800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km}
\]

Thus, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[
\boxed{3140}
\]"
"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge at 6,000 feet (10,000 feet - 4,000 feet). Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb from 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet.

The number of feet Oliver must climb is:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Mr. Josue received from the second bank.
2. Add the amounts received from both banks to the initial capital he had.

First, we know that the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts received from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

First, four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these from the initial number of cats:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these from the remaining cats:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Now, we add up all these costs:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256
\]

The total cost for 2 years of the service is \(\$256\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations. Let \( S_{\text{tattered}} \) be the savings from the tattered jeans and \( S_{\text{jogger}} \) be the savings from the jogger jeans. We know:
\[ S_{\text{tattered}} + S_{\text{jogger}} = 6 \]
\[ S_{\text{jogger}} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_{\text{tattered}} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is the difference between their original price and the sale price. Let \( P_{\text{tattered}} \) be the original price of the tattered jeans. The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and the savings is $4, so:
\[ P_{\text{tattered}} - 28 = 4 \]
\[ P_{\text{tattered}} = 32 \]

Similarly, the savings from the jogger jeans is the difference between their original price and the sale price. Let \( P_{\text{jogger}} \) be the original price of the jogger jeans. The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and the savings is $2, so:
\[ P_{\text{jogger}} - 22 = 2 \]
\[ P_{\text{jogger}} = 24 \]

Now, we need to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:
\[ P_{\text{jogger}} - P_{\text{tattered}} = 24 - 32 = -8 \]

Since the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, and the result is negative, it means the tattered jeans originally cost more. The absolute difference is:
\[ 32 - 24 = 8 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees

"To determine how many birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of bird feeders:**
   - Lillian builds 3 bird feeders.
   - She buys 3 bird feeders.
   - Total bird feeders = 3 (built) + 3 (bought) = 6 bird feeders.

2. **Determine the bird attraction of each type of feeder:**
   - Store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each.
   - Lillian's homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones.
   - Therefore, homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

3. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:**
   - Lillian has 3 homemade feeders.
   - Each homemade feeder attracts 30 birds.
   - Total birds from homemade feeders = 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

4. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:**
   - Lillian has 3 store-bought feeders.
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Total birds from store-bought feeders = 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

5. **Sum the total number of birds attracted by all feeders:**
   - Total birds = Birds from homemade feeders + Birds from store-bought feeders
   - Total birds = 90 + 60 = 150 birds.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see \(\boxed{150}\) birds in her garden each day."
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel:**
   The bagel costs $4.

2. **Cost of the soup:**
   The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. First, we calculate 25% of the bagel's cost:
   \[
   0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5
   \]

3. **Cost of the cake:**
   The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, we calculate half of the bagel's cost:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

4. **Total cost:**
   Now, we sum the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
   \[
   5 + 4 + 2 = 11
   \]

Thus, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

1. Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.
2. The money he gets from selling the cards is \( \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 \) dollars.
3. After buying the ticket for $100, he has $50 left for spending cash. Therefore, the money he gets from selling the cards minus the cost of the ticket equals $50.

We can set up the following equation based on the information provided:
\[
\frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 - 100 = 50
\]

First, simplify the left side of the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = x
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
x - 100 = 50
\]

Next, solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 50 + 100
\]
\[
x = 150
\]

Therefore, Kenny started with \(\boxed{150}\) cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Calculation of Hotdogs Prepared:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, 18 guests would get 2 hotdogs each, and the other 18 guests would get 1 hotdog each.
   - The total number of hotdogs prepared is \(18 \times 2 + 18 \times 1 = 36 + 18 = 54\) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Number of Guests and Hotdogs Needed:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and each wanted a second hotdog.
   - This means each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) hotdogs.

3. **Comparison of Hotdogs Prepared and Needed:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 80 hotdogs are needed.
   - The shortfall in hotdogs is \(80 - 54 = 26\) hotdogs.

4. **Determine How Many Guests Did Not Get a Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each additional hotdog is for one guest, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

**Final Answer:**
26 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. According to the problem, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Adding 4 to this number gives:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

So, her sister's name has 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name to find the total:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final amount for Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6

- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- Saved from allowance: $2
- Given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs:

Amount needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Amount needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gas Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as follows:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

This means George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought \(\boxed{5}\) candy bars."
"First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray originally had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Next, we need to divide these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide 20 by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of Ray's friends received \(\boxed{5}\) lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. If Rory and her mom each have one piece, that's 2 pieces in total. 

Each piece weighs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

So, the weight of the 2 pieces they ate is:
\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the cake is:
\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he needs:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for the onions is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Bernadette to be driven to the theater. Since Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, we calculate Bernadette's drive time as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Wayne wants Bernadette to arrive 5 minutes before him. Therefore, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him. Since Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne to account for her longer drive time.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room in feet. We know the area of the room and the length, and we need to convert the length from yards to feet since 1 yard = 3 feet.

1. Convert the length from yards to feet:
   \[
   \text{Length} = 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. Use the area formula for a rectangle (Area = Length × Width) to find the width:
   \[
   \text{Area} = 360 \text{ square feet} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width}
   \]
   Solving for the width:
   \[
   \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. Now, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula for the perimeter (Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)):
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet}
   \]

The perimeter of the room is \(\boxed{98}\) feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth's total is:
\[ 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, Margareth's total is:
\[ 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other. We subtract the smaller total from the larger total:
\[ 140 - 60 = 80 \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking Process**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
   - Total time baking = 3 hours
   - Total temperature increase = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. **Cooling Process**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes
   - Total time the window is open = 30 minutes
   - Total cooling = (2 degrees/10 minutes) * 30 minutes = 6 degrees
   - New temperature after cooling = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The final temperature of the house is **49 degrees**."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

1. **Swim:**
   - Jon's time: 40 minutes
   - James' time: \(40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes}\)

2. **Bike Ride:**
   - Jon's time: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
   - James' time: \(80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes}\)

3. **Run:**
   - Jon's time: 50 minutes
   - Let \(x\) be the time James took for the run.

The total time for Jon is:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is:
\[ 170 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can set up the equation for James' total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 180 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

1. Convert 30 minutes to hours: \( \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \) hours.
2. Calculate the distance the horse runs: \( 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats for 16 miles. Since the horse eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) a bail of hay per mile:

3. Calculate the total hay consumed: \( 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \).

Now, we need to find out the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3:

4. Calculate the total cost of the hay: \( 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \).

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:

5. Calculate the total amount of money Michael has: \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

Finally, we need to find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay:

"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also uses 2 additional eggs that were loose in the cupboard.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the number of glasses of eggnog she can make is:

\[
\frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs per glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses per tray}} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

   \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from the flash sale:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} \times \text{Price per sneaker at flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} = \text{Total number of sneakers} - \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} = 48 - 17 = 31
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} \times \text{Price per sneaker to department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   \[

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of one raised bed is given by:

\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:

"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After about twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies come from the east and join the fairies that were already there. Half of 50 is 25, so 25 more fairies joined the 50 that Katelyn initially saw. The total number of fairies then became:

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is:

\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

Thus, the number of fairies remaining is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of puppies.
2. Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.
3. Determine the percentage of puppies with spots.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of puppies.**

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. Therefore, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.**

Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. Therefore, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

**Step 3: Determine the percentage of puppies with spots.**

The percentage of puppies with spots is calculated by dividing the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies, and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = \( 42 \times 75 = 3150 \) pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = \( 20 \times 65 = 1300 \) pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - The farmer buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
\[ 3150 \text{ (hay)} + 1300 \text{ (oats)} + 48 \text{ (carrots)} + 2 \text{ (sugar cubes)} = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip would still require a full trip to transport the remaining feed).

\[ \frac{4500}{2250} = 2 \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling aluminum cans in a week. She recycles three aluminum cans each week, and each can is worth two cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from cans are:
\[ 3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from recycling plastic bottles in a week. She recycles five plastic bottles each week, and each bottle is worth three cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from bottles are:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week} \]

Now, let's find out how much she earns in total from recycling both cans and bottles in a week:
\[ 6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \]

To find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:

"First, let's calculate the combined length of the two remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, so two remoras would be:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to convert the shark's body length from feet to inches to make the units consistent. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, a 10-foot shark is:

\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. The formula to calculate the percentage is:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ days} \]

The total time he needs to walk is 240 minutes. To find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total time by the number of days he will be walking:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

So, Jason has to spend \(\boxed{20}\) minutes walking each day."
"To determine how many books each of Sarah's children received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Sarah bought.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of children.

First, we find out how many books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we divide $300 by $15:

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of children. Sarah has 4 children, so we divide 20 by 4:

\[
\text{Number of books per child} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Therefore, each child received \(\boxed{5}\) books."
"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to either dairy or peanuts is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides.

1. Calculate the total number of employees:
   - There are 3 groups of employees.
   - Each group has 200 employees.
   - Therefore, the total number of employees is \(3 \times 200 = 600\).

2. Calculate the total number of tour guides:
   - There are 3 groups, and each group is assigned 7 tour guides.
   - Therefore, the total number of tour guides is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).

3. Calculate the total number of people going on the tour:
   - Add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides.
   - Therefore, the total number of people is \(600 + 21 = 621\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
621
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend. The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend, we calculate the increased cost as follows:

\[ \text{Increased cost per day} = 1500 + (1500 \times 0.20) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:

\[ \text{Total hotel cost} = 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. The cost of each plane ticket is $5000, and since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:

\[ \text{Total plane ticket cost} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the plane tickets and the total cost of the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:

\[ \text{Total trip cost} = 5400 + 10000 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:

\[ \boxed{15400} \]"
"First, let's determine how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, we calculate:

\[ \text{Tubes of blue paint Jasper has} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Next, let's determine how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, and Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, we calculate:

\[ \text{Tubes of yellow paint Jasper has} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Now, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint that Jasper has to find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has:

\[ \text{Total tubes of paint Jasper has} = 2 + 9 = 11 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains and the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"To determine how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first calculate the total amount they have already earned. Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 83 + 91 = 174 \]

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they have already earned from their goal:

\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

Therefore, they need to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each currently has from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since Stetson ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. According to the bet, Stetson gives up $10 for each orange he eats. Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To determine the cost of Jillian's handbag, we start by identifying the given information and setting up the appropriate equation.

1. Jillian's shoes cost $80.
2. The handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes.

First, calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, subtract $20 from this amount to find the cost of the handbag:
\[ 240 - 20 = 220 \]

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, calculate the total miles James runs in a week:

\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption over five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.

The average highest temperature of these three countries is \(-10\) degrees Fahrenheit."
"First, we need to determine how much more money the child needs to save to buy the toy car. The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining $8 if he saves $2 each day. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child \(\boxed{4}\) days to save the remaining amount of money."
"First, we calculate the total capacity of the 2 trays Jaime has. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs, the total capacity for 2 trays is:

\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Jaime has 64 eggs, but the trays can only hold 48 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't be able to be placed on the tray, we subtract the total capacity of the trays from the number of eggs Jaime has:

\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the tray is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

1. Identify the cost of the small pizza.
2. Calculate the cost of the family-size pizza.
3. Add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

First, the cost of the small pizza is given as $8.

Next, the family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza. Therefore, we calculate the cost of the family-size pizza as follows:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:
\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Thus, the total amount Sally spends is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"To determine the cost per razor after the discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.
   - Converting this to cents, $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor, after the discount, is 25 cents."
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches. In a human pyramid, the height of the pyramid is determined by the height of the topmost person, as they are the highest point.

The height of the human pyramid is therefore 60 inches.

To convert this height into feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches.

\[ \text{Height in feet} = \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."

"Let's denote Angela's current age as \( A \).

According to the problem, in four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).

In four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \). We can set up the following equation based on the information given:

\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \( A \):

\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Angela is 38 years old."

- Paul drives in the morning each day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives in the morning for 14 days.

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars/ride} \times 14 \text{ rides} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon each day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives in the afternoon for 14 days.

The total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars/ride} \times 14 \text{ rides} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:

"To determine the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( n \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25n \)

We need to find the number of guests, \( n \), for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

To solve for \( n \), we first isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Lily as \( L \), and by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together they collected 43 insects: \( L + D + B = 43 \).
2. Lily found 7 more than David: \( L = D + 7 \).
3. David found half of what Bodhi found: \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) or equivalently \( B = 2D \).

We can substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \( D = 9 \), we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

To verify, we check the total:
\[ L + D + B = 16 + 9 + 18 = 43 \]
The total is correct. Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, the amount of yarn Mariah used is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. The amount of yarn her grandma used is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

Therefore, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:
\[

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Using the width of the rug we just calculated:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total: two packs of strawberry, one pack of grape, and one pack of green apple.

We know the following:
- The cost of one pack of grape gum is $2.
- The cost of one pack of green apple gum is half the cost of one pack of grape gum, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.
- The total cost of all the gum is $7.

The total cost can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs \( \boxed{2} \) dollars."
"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood. The 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks, while the 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood}
\]
If he buys 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood, he will get:
\[
6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces of 2 x 8 wood}
\]
If he buys 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he will get:
\[
4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Comparing the two options, buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood gives him more sticks (1600 sticks) than buying 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood (1200 sticks). Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is:
\[
\boxed{1600}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of legs among Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, the total number of legs is:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$4.40 \text{ per day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ \$4.40 \text{ per day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

The cost of the weekly bus pass is $20. To find out how much she would save by buying the weekly bus pass, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her trips without the pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to verify the number of cows in the zoo based on the information that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo would have:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to verify the number of sheep on the farm based on the information that the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm would have:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

So, the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by analyzing the information given:

1. Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
2. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( O \) and the number of potatoes she bought as \( P \).

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times what Sophia bought:
\[ 4O = 12 \]
\[ 4P = 4 \]

We can solve these equations for \( O \) and \( P \):
\[ O = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]
\[ P = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these together:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, after buying clothes, Julie had:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, after buying CDs, Julie had:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Julie had left is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, using the relationship \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Tara incurred for buying the canvas bags.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so the total number of bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for the bags is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue Tara earned from selling the bags.

She sold each of the 40 bags for $8, so the total revenue is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount of money can be calculated as follows:
\[ 4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. Therefore, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving $80 to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \]

After buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

1. **Current Daily Consumption:**
   - Ada consumes 12 kilowatts per hour daily.

2. **Current Weekly Consumption:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - There are 7 days in a week, so her weekly consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

3. **Current Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her weekly cost is:
     \[
     84 \text{ kWh/week} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/kWh} = 126 \text{ dollars/week}
     \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's new weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

4. **New Daily Consumption:**
   - The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour daily.
   - Therefore, her new daily consumption is:
     \[

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[ 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 \]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin:
\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. Let the cost of one monitor be \( x \). Therefore, the total cost can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + \text{Cost of the printer} = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 1100 + 2x + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 1800 + 2x = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( \boxed{300} \) dollars."

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to break down the month into its halves and understand the relationship between the savings in the first and second halves.

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the next 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings for the first half of April would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. So, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). The total savings for the second half of April would be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's total savings for the month of April should be $1125. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total savings for the month:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, the daily savings in the first half of April is $25. Since the daily savings in the second half is twice that of the first half, we calculate:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit Verna bought:

1. **Apples:**
   - Number of apples: 3
   - Cost per apple: $1.50
   - Total cost for apples: \( 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50 \)

2. **Oranges:**
   - Number of oranges: 5
   - Cost per orange: $0.80
   - Total cost for oranges: \( 5 \times 0.80 = 4.00 \)

3. **Peaches:**
   - Number of peaches: 6
   - Cost per peach: $0.75
   - Total cost for peaches: \( 6 \times 0.75 = 4.50 \)

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the fruits:

\[
4.50 \, (\text{apples}) + 4.00 \, (\text{oranges}) + 4.50 \, (\text{peaches}) = 13.00
\]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find the change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:

\[
20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
\]

Thus, the change Verna received is \(\boxed{7.00}\)."
"To determine how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total earnings for each and then find the difference.

First, calculate Jairus's total earnings:
- Jairus earns $0.8 per task.

\text{Jairus's total earnings} = 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, calculate Jenny's total earnings:
- Jenny earns $0.5 per task.
- She completed 20 tasks.

\[
\text{Jenny's total earnings} = 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings:

\[
\text{Difference} = 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Jairus will get \(\boxed{6}\) dollars more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"Jeff walks to work and back home each day, which is a total of 3 miles to work + 3 miles back home = 6 miles per day. If he works 5 times a week, then the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles.

30 miles"
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down her actions step by step.

1. **Writing the alphabet in full twice:**
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it once: 26 letters.
   - Writing it twice: \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Writing half of the alphabet once:**
   - Half of the alphabet is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) letters.
   - Writing half once: 13 letters.

3. **Re-writing everything she has already written:**
   - The total number of letters written so far is \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.
   - Re-writing these 65 letters: 65 letters.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Thus, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(\boxed{130}\)."

"To determine how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of toys in James's play set:**
   James's play set has 80 toys.

2. **Determine the size of the sorted play set Jonathan wants to make:**
   Jonathan wants to make a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set.
   \[
   5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
   \]

3. **Express the relationship between the number of toys Jonathan currently has and the number he needs:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have enough for his sorted play set.
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]
   Subtract 2 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 400 - 2
   \]
   \[
   x = 398

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]
So, the discount amount is $3.00.

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, the final amount Daniel has to spend is:
\[
\boxed{27.00}

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned from her sales, we need to break down the commission calculation into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the commission for the amount over $1000.

1. **Commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission amount = $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

2. **Commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
   - Commission rate for the amount over $1000 is 10%.
   - Commission amount = $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

3. **Total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission for the first $1000 + Commission for the amount over $1000.
   - Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, the amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"First, let's calculate the total number of water bottles Bill already has. He has 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. Therefore, the total number of bottles he starts with is:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles per case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles Bill expects to give out. He has 70 guests and wants to provide 2 bottles per guest. Therefore, the total number of bottles needed is:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles per guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

\[ 140 \text{ bottles needed} - 48 \text{ bottles he has} = 92 \text{ additional bottles} \]

Therefore, Bill needs to buy an additional 92 bottles of water."
"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. Since it takes him 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, we can calculate the time it takes in warm water as follows:

\[ \text{Time in warm water for 1 mile} = 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day. We start by calculating the total time for 3 miles in each condition.

For cold water:
\[ \text{Time for 3 miles in cold water} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ \text{Time for 3 miles in warm water} = 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:
\[ \text{Difference in time} = 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:

\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

John wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him to save this amount, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."

- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the total number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- The total number of rodents is \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Thus, the pet shop has a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob based on the information given:

1. Mark's weight is 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is:
   \[
   150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is:
   \[
   2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends (3):
\[

   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is **82 degrees**."
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. Therefore, the age of the younger son is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs one candle per year, the total number of candles required is:

\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total amount James spends on candles is:

"First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read each night in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \approx 1.3333 \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \). According to the problem, Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \). At that time, his age will be three times his nephew's age, which will be \( N + 7 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \frac{51}{3} = N + 7 \]
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Then, we subtract 7 from both sides to solve for \( N \):

\[ 17 - 7 = N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently \(\boxed{10}\) years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 per tooth.
   - Therefore, for three teeth, the total amount is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as she had given for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Since the previous amount was $1.00, half of that is \( \frac{1}{2} = 0.50 \) dollars per tooth.
   - Therefore, for two teeth, the total amount is \(2 \times 0.50 = 1\) dollar.

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount = \(5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00\) dollars.

Thus, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of \(\boxed{9.00}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of goals each teenager scored based on the information given.

1. Let \( R \) represent the number of goals Richie scored.
2. Let \( M \) represent the number of goals Mark scored.
3. Let \( A \) represent the number of goals Anna scored.

From the problem, we know:
- Richie scored 80 goals, so \( R = 80 \).
- Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so \( R = M + 20 \).
- Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so \( R = A + 45 \).

Using the value of \( R \):
- Since \( R = 80 \), we can find \( M \) by solving \( 80 = M + 20 \):
  \[
  M = 80 - 20 = 60
  \]
- We can find \( A \) by solving \( 80 = A + 45 \):
  \[
  A = 80 - 45 = 35
  \]

Now, we sum the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[
R + M + A = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much money Mitchell made from selling lemonade. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, the total amount of money Mitchell made is:

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times \$4 \text{ per lemonade} = \$84 \]

Next, we know that Liam made $63 that weekend. To find out how much more money Mitchell made compared to Liam, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made:

\[ \$84 - \$63 = \$21 \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), he spends:

\[
\frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
\]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. The total amount spent from Sunday to Wednesday is:

\[
10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[
\frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{5 \text{ dollars/action figure}} = 8 \text{ action figures}
\]

After Wednesday, he has:

\[
70 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

For the rest of the week (Thursday and Friday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[
\frac{30 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ dollars/action figure}} = 15 \text{ action figures}
\]

Adding the wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[
8 \text{ wooden action figures} + 15 \text{ plastic action figures} = 23 \text{ action figures}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months} \]

Katina removes $100 each month, so over 24 months, she will remove:
\[ 24 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:
\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money remaining in the account after 2 years is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00.

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf of bread costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00.
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00.

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The net profit is \(\boxed{37}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of crayons Kate has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each:

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many crayon muffins she can make. Since she uses 8 small pieces of crayon for each muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:

\[ 192 \div 8 = 24 \text{ muffins} \]

If Kate sells each muffin for $1.50, we can calculate the total amount of money she can make by multiplying the number of muffins by the price per muffin:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Kate can make is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to consider the cost of the carpet itself, the padding, the removal of the old carpet, and the installation of the new carpet. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the bedroom:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of carpet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2592
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the padding:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of removal} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of installation} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = \$7344
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of carpet} + \text{Cost of padding} + \text{Cost of removal} + \text{Cost of installation}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$2592 + \$432 + \$864 + \$7344 = \$11232
   \]

Therefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is **$11232**."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw and then divide that by the number of days.

1. Calculate the total number of birds seen:
   - Days one and two: 50 birds
   - Day three: 0 birds
   - Days four and five: 120 birds
   - Day six: 20 birds
   - Day seven: 90 birds

   Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

2. Divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7 days) to find the average:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{280}{7} = 40
   \]

Therefore, on average, Mack saw 40 birds per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.

2. **First Operation**: The starting value plus half the number is divided by 5.
   - Let the number be \( x \). Here, \( x = 20 \).
   - Half of the number is \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
   - Adding the starting value to half the number gives \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).
   - Dividing this sum by 5 gives \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).

3. **Second Operation**: The resulting value is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12.
   - The starting value minus 12 is \( 20 - 12 = 8 \).
   - Multiplying the resulting value from the first operation by this gives \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

Thus, the final value of the number train is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards, which means his brother has \(5 - 3 = 2\) cards. Together, they have \(5 + 2 = 7\) cards.

"To determine the correct temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. The actual temperature is 468 when Maggie sets it to 450. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature, when increased by 4%, equals 520 degrees. Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Then:

\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then sum them up.

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
   - 2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes
   - Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we add the durations of the two movies:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we start by calculating 30% of the value of Herb's house. Herb's house is worth $76,000. 

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we subtract this amount from the value of Herb's house:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

Next, we add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house to find the combined value:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

Therefore, the combined value of the two houses is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. Since a dozen is 12, Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Therefore, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought: \(12 + 40 = 52\)
- Total dishes brought: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

\[52 + 68 = 120\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts and typically contacts are not sold in pairs but individually, we assume it's asking for the cost per contact. However, if we interpret ""pair"" as a common packaging unit (which is not standard for contacts but sometimes used in pricing), and assuming each box contains 90 individual contacts, the cost per ""pair"" (assuming 2 contacts per pair) would be:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90 \text{ pairs}} = 2.00 \]

But based on the standard interpretation of the question, the cost per contact is:
\[ 1.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for each person. Since they are paid $10 per hour:

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

According to the given ratio, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how much water she needs for 1600 calories, we can set up the following calculation:

\[ \text{Water needed} = \left( \frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} \right) \times 1600 \text{ calories} \]

\[ \text{Water needed} = \left( \frac{100}{200} \right) \times 1600 \]

\[ \text{Water needed} = 0.5 \times 1600 \]

\[ \text{Water needed} = 800 \text{ ml} \]

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note on the jar, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. So, we can write the equation:
\[
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
3B = 4500
\]
Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[
B = 1500
\]
Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. The number of red jelly beans is:
\[
0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485
\]
The number of green jelly beans is:
\[
1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515
\]
To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[
1515 - 1485 = 30
\]
Thus, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"First, let's identify the three measurements of Jared's typing speed:
1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Next, we calculate the average of these three measurements. The formula for the average is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements.

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

Now, let's perform the addition in the numerator:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Then, we divide by the number of measurements, which is 3:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

So, the average of the three measurements is:

\[
\boxed{52}

1. **Weight change from eating Cheerios:**
   - Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is:
     \[
     1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds}
     \]

2. **Weight change from eating donuts:**
   - Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is:
     \[
     1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds}
     \]

3. **Difference in weight change:**
   - The difference in weight change between eating donuts and Cheerios is:
     \[
     8.75 \, \text{pounds} - (-6.25 \, \text{pounds}) = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} + 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 15 \, \text{pounds}

Therefore, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is **15 pounds**."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. **Initial Email Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people via email.
   - Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people invited by email is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Additional Invitations via Phone:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends say they will bring their spouses.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people (friends and their spouses) is \(8 + 8 = 16\).

3. **Total Number of People:**
   - The total number of people attending the event is the sum of the initial 100 people, the 200 additional people invited by email, and the 16 additional people from the phone calls.

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the protein content per 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - We know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain \(2 \times 3 = 6\) grams of protein (since 200 grams is twice 100 grams).

2. **Calculate the protein content per week:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, the total protein intake per week is \(6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week}\).

Therefore, John gets **42 grams** of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( J \) from both sides:
\[ 0 = J - 10 \]
Add 10 to both sides:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"First, let's convert all of Colby's coins into their equivalent value in nickels, since each gumball costs a nickel.

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is equal to 5 nickels, 8 quarters are equal to \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime is equal to 2 nickels, 6 dimes are equal to \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which are already in nickels, so that's \(14\) nickels.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since 1 nickel is equal to 5 pennies, 15 pennies are equal to \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels.

Now, let's add up all the nickels Colby has:
\[40 + 12 + 14 + 3 = 69\] nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{69}

"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

we substitute the distance (2000 miles) and the speed (400 miles per hour):

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \text{Pounds Ruiz makes per hour} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in one hour:

\[ \text{Pounds Marissa makes per hour} = 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ \text{Pounds together per hour} = 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we calculate the total amount of chocolates they made together in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total pounds in 12 hours} = 105 \times 12 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To determine how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate his total expenditure over the three days and subtract that from his original amount of $100.

1. **Monday's expenditure:**
   Howard spends $8 at the arcade on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's expenditure:**
   On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday. Therefore, his expenditure on Tuesday is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Wednesday's expenditure:**
   On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday. Therefore, his expenditure on Wednesday is:
   \[
   4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total expenditure:**
   Adding up the expenditures from all three days, we get:
   \[
   8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Money left:**
   Subtracting the total expenditure from the original amount of $100, we find:
   \[
   100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the amount of money Howard has left is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's calculate the earnings from the first four hours:

- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.
- Therefore, in one hour, he earned \( 15 \times 0.50 = 7.50 \) dollars.
- Over four hours, he earned \( 4 \times 7.50 = 30 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours:

- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
- Therefore, in one hour, he earned \( 10 \times 0.60 = 6.00 \) dollars.
- Over two hours, he earned \( 2 \times 6.00 = 12 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:

- Total earnings = \( 30 + 12 = 42 \) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is \(\boxed{42}\) dollars."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per mile:**
   - Given: 2 miles = 725 rotations.
   - Therefore, 1 mile = \(\frac{725}{2} = 362.5\) rotations.

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - Total rotations per month = \(400 \times 362.5 = 145,000\) rotations.

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Total rotations per year = \(145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000\) rotations.

Therefore, the tire needs to be replaced after \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washings per bottle:**
   - The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.

2. **Calculate the number of washings per pump:**
   - Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, each pump gives:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost per washing:**
   - The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings, so the cost per washing is:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost per pump:**
   - Since each pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:
     \[
     0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \times 60 \text{ washings per pump} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
     \]

5. **Convert the cost per pump to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, the cost per pump in cents is:
     \[
     12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."

   - Price after discount: \( 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \)

2. **Discount on the shorts:**
   - Original price of the shorts: $35
   - Discount: 30%
   - Discount amount: \( 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \)

3. **Total cost after discounts:**
   - Total cost: \( 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \)

4. **Money left after the purchase:**
   - Joe's initial amount: $50
   - Total cost after discounts: $42.00
   - Money left: \( 50 - 42 = 8.00 \)

Next, calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$95060 \]

Now, find the difference in cost between repaving Lewis' street and Monica's street:
\[ \text{Difference in cost} = \$95060 - \$29100 = \$65960 \]

So, the cost to repave Lewis' street is \$65960 more than the cost to repave Monica's street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the initial 5 months and the subsequent 5 months.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Total cost for the first 5 months: \( 5 \times 100,000 = 500,000 \) dollars.

2. **Subsequent 5 months:**
   - Each of these months costs 50% more than the previous month.
   - The cost for the 6th month is \( 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000 \) dollars.
   - The cost for the 7th month is \( 150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000 \) dollars.
   - The cost for the 8th month is \( 225,000 \times 1.5 = 337,500 \) dollars.
   - The cost for the 9th month is \( 337,500 \times 1.5 = 506,250 \) dollars.
   - The cost for the 10th month is \( 506,250 \times 1.5 = 759,375 \) dollars.

Now, we sum the costs for these 5 months:
\[ 150,000 + 225,000 + 337,500 + 506,250 + 759,375 = 1,978,125 \] dollars.

3. **Total cost:**
   - Adding the initial 5 months and the subsequent 5 months:
   \[ 500,000 + 1,978,125 = 2,478,125 \] dollars.

Thus, the total cost of John's research is:

"To determine the total number of ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to add up the amounts of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since one pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the amounts of meat consumed by the first three players:
\[6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Thus, the total number of ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

This means 18 seats were occupied by the administrators. To find out how many seats were left after the administrators took their seats, we subtract the number of occupied seats by the administrators from the total number of seats:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how many seats were left for the students. We subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

**Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s**

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

**Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h:
\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is \(\boxed{72}\) Mb per hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in that week, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Cars towed in the first three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
     \[

"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet to compare it with the height requirement for the roller coaster. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The roller coaster requires a height of 4 feet. To find out how much more Adam needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:

\[ \text{Height needed to grow} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the height he needs to grow into inches:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches, given that he grows 2 inches per year:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars:**
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   For 10 cars:
   \[

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

1. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
   - Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

2. **Determine the time it takes to close the gap:**
   - Initial distance between Tom and Bob: 75 miles
   - Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To determine how many fish Tommy caught, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. First, we know that Naomi caught 17 fish.
   \[
   \text{Naomi's fish} = 17
   \]

2. Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi. So, we calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from the number of fish Naomi caught.
   \[
   \text{Darren's fish} = 17 - 6 = 11
   \]

3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we calculate the number of fish Tommy caught by adding 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.
   \[
   \text{Tommy's fish} = 11 + 3 = 14
   \]

Therefore, the number of fish Tommy caught is \(\boxed{14}\)."

   \[
   \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10 - x}
   \]

4. **Set up the inequality to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss:**
   \[
   \frac{\$60}{10 - x} \leq \$10
   \]

5. **Solve the inequality:**
   \[
   60 \leq 10(10 - x)
   \]
   \[
   60 \leq 100 - 10x
   \]
   \[
   10x \leq 40
   \]
   \[
   x \leq 4

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month.
2. Calculate the total earnings for the first month.
3. Determine the earnings for the second month.
4. Calculate the total earnings for both months.

**Step 1: Determine the amount earned from green hats in the first month.**

We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month are:
\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total earnings for the first month.**

The total earnings for the first month are the sum of the earnings from red and green hats:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

**Step 3: Determine the earnings for the second month.**

The sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the earnings for the second month are:

"First, let's determine the total time James hires the horse-drawn carriage. He hires it from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. Since he gets 1 hour free, he effectively pays for 3 hours.

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first hour costs $15.
- Each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour, so each additional hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- The cost for the first hour is $15.
- The cost for the next two hours (since he gets 1 hour free, he pays for 2 more hours) is $30 per hour.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 15 + 30 + 30 = 75 \]

Therefore, the total amount James paid is \(\boxed{75}\)."

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

Thus, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs \(\boxed{3}\) dollars more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.
3. The total number of animal heads is 20.
4. The total number of animal legs is 70.

We can write the following equations based on the information:
1. The total number of heads equation: \( S + G = 20 \)
2. The total number of legs equation: \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

To verify, we can substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( G \):
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Now, let's check the number of legs:
- Sheep: \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs
- Geese: \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) legs
- Total legs: \( 60 + 10 = 70 \)

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find 20% of $5:
\[ 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Therefore, for a week (7 days), he needs:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds of coffee} \]

The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Additionally, Roger buys a donut for $2. 

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the coffee and the donut:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought, excluding the apple pie, and then subtract this from the total amount spent.

1. Calculate the cost of the 2 bags of chips:
   \[
   2 \text{ bags} \times \$2.00 \text{ per bag} = \$4.00

   \[
   \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
   \]

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the cooking class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. Therefore, the weekly class time is:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

The class lasts for 6 weeks, so the total class time is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total class time by the time it takes to learn one recipe:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers and math teachers on the basketball court.

"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add together the amounts of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out how much each person would have if they shared the total money equally, we divide the total by 3:

\[
\text{Money per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, if they decided to add together their money and share it equally, each would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"To determine the total duration of Sarah’s basketball game, we need to calculate the time for the standard quarters and add the extra time for the tie.

1. Each of the first three quarters is 12 minutes long.
2. There are three such quarters, so the total time for the first three quarters is:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. The last quarter is also 12 minutes long, but it was extended by 5 minutes due to a tie. Therefore, the last quarter lasted:
   \[
   12 + 5 = 17 \text{ minutes}
   \]
4. Adding the time for the first three quarters and the extended last quarter gives:
   \[
   36 + 17 = 53 \text{ minutes}

"To determine how many good days Christina had left in the month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count of Good Days:**
   - Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days.

2. **Good Days in the Next Three Days:**
   - The next three days were good, neutral, and good.
   - This adds 2 more good days to her count.

3. **Total Good Days:**
   - Adding the initial good days to the good days from the next three days:
     \[
     12 + 2 = 14
     \]

4. **Good Days Left in the Month:**
   - Since the month has 30 days and she has already recorded 33 days (30 initial + 3 additional), we need to check if she has any days left to record.
   - However, the problem states she has already recorded 30 days, so the next three days are part of the same month.
   - Therefore, the total number of good days in the month is 14.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has \(\boxed{9}\) books."
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for consistency. Since the growth rate is given in inches per day, we'll convert the current height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo needs to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. The total growth needed is:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches in height.

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the total number of toys James needs.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - When he returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so the number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for 24 dogs.

3. **After Buying More Toys:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - When he returns again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he still has 24 toys but only needs enough for 21 dogs.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - The total number of toys James needs is the number of toys he has after the last purchase, which is 24.

Thus, the total number of toys James needs is \(\boxed{24}\)."

"To solve this problem, we first determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can find out how many hash browns one potato makes by dividing 36 by 6:

\[ \frac{36}{6} = 6 \]

This means that 1 potato makes 6 hash browns. Now, to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we multiply the number of hash browns one potato makes by the total number of potatoes:

\[ 96 \times 6 = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, calculate the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack:

- Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
- There are 9 people in total (Jack + 8 adults).

Total weight = 9 people * 80 kg/person = 720 kg.

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg.

To find out by how much they have exceeded the maximum load:

Exceeded load = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

By riding the elevator, they will have exceeded the maximum load by 20 kg."
"Let's break down the information given step by step to find out how many cookies each person has and then calculate the total number of cookies.

1. **Katarina's Cookies:**
   Katarina has 68 cookies.

2. **Max's Cookies:**
   Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. Therefore, Max has:
   \[
   68 + 5 = 73 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Cookie Monster's Cookies:**
   Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. Therefore, the Cookie Monster has:
   \[
   73 - 12 = 61 \text{ cookies}
   \]

4. **Summer's Cookies:**
   Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. Therefore, Summer has:
   \[

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

"To determine how long it took Chris to mow his lawn by mowing half in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we need to calculate the time taken for each half separately and then sum them up.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
- Mowing the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode takes 1 hour, which is 60 minutes.
- Therefore, mowing half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode takes \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
- Mowing the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode takes 40 minutes.
- Therefore, mowing half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode takes \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

Now, we add the time taken for both halves:
- Time for half in ""turtle"" mode: 30 minutes
- Time for half in ""rabbit"" mode: 20 minutes

"To determine the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit separately and then sum these costs.

1. **Apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples.
   - The price per kilo of apples is $4.
   - Therefore, the cost for apples is:
     \[
     1 \text{ kilo} \times \$4/\text{kilo} = \$4
     \]

2. **Bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas.
   - The price per kilo of bananas is $2.

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( T_1 \) be the age of one of the twins.
- Let \( T_2 \) be the age of the other twin.
- Let \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_3 \) be the ages of the triplets.

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44:
\[ T_1 + T_2 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

Since the twins are the same age, \( T_1 = T_2 \). Therefore, we can simplify the equation to:
\[ 2T_1 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

We also know from the first equation that \( T_1 = P_1 + 7 \). Substituting \( T_1 \) in the combined age equation, we get:
\[ 2(P_1 + 7) + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 2P_1 + 14 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 3P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 3P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 30 \]

Since \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_3 \) are the ages of the triplets and they are the same age, let's denote the age of each triplet as \( P \). Therefore:
\[ 3P + P = 30 \]
\[ 4P = 30 \]
\[ P = 7.5 \]

Now, substituting \( P = 7.5 \) back into the equation for \( T_1 \):
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 \]

Thus, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ \boxed{14.5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends on his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:

3 hours = 3 × 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap:

Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Time spent on homework
Time for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that the total cost of four candies is part of the $3.20, and the rest is the cost of the lollipops.

The cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

The cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Therefore, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each has saved over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years are:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years are:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding Rong's and Neil's total savings together, we get:

Thus, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.6x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of a banana. We know that one apple costs $0.50 and a banana costs twice as much as an apple. Therefore, the cost of one banana is:
\[ 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of an orange. An orange costs three times as much as a banana. Therefore, the cost of one orange is:
\[ 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the bananas in the crate. There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for the bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1.00 = 5.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the apples in the crate. There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for the apples is:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the oranges in the crate. There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for the oranges is:
\[ 7 \times 3.00 = 21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the crate:
\[ 5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - Given: 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 (red squares) + 4 = 18.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 (blue squares) + 6 = 24.

4. **White Squares:**
   - There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 (green squares) - 12 = 12.

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total number of square feet is equal to the total number of squares.

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs currently available and then compare it to the total number of chairs required for the function.

1. **Calculate the number of regular chairs:**
   The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs:
   \[
   \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of chairs currently available:**
   \[
   \text{Total chairs available} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function, so the total number of chairs needed is:
   \[
   \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57
   \]

4. **Determine how many more chairs are needed:**
   \[
   \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total chairs available} = 57 - 48 = 9
   \]

Therefore, Mia needs to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"First, we need to determine the number of bucks among the 50 deer. Since 50 percent of the deer are bucks, we calculate:

\[ 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]

So, there are 25 bucks.

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. We know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, so we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of 8 point bucks is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam's Points**: Adam has 50 points.
2. **Betty's Points**: Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points.
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Tom's Points**: Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]
4. **Betty's Points (Recheck)**: We already calculated Betty's points as 65.
5. **Marta's Points**: Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all students:
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the class is missing:
\[
400 - 255 = 145 \text{ points}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{145}

   - Each of her 3 children has 3 children of their own.
   - Therefore, the total number of grandchildren is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).

3. **Great Grandma Jones' Great-Grandbabies:**
   - Each of her 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own.
   - Therefore, the total number of great-grandbabies is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Thus, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her paycheck for this:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she has put into her retirement account and used for her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is:

\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"First, we determine how many pencils are currently in the box. Since the box has space for 20 pencils but 4 are missing, we subtract 4 from 20:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box. Since one pair consists of 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils by 2:

\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:

- The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from the city = \(15 \times 20 = 300\) fireworks.

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:

- Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from Hannah = \(3 \times 5 = 15\) fireworks.

Now, let's determine how many of the city's fireworks Hannah will see. She can see 40% of the city's fireworks:

- 40% of the city's fireworks = \(0.40 \times 300 = 120\) fireworks.

Finally, we add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city to the fireworks she sets off herself to get the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:

- Total fireworks Hannah will see = \(120 + 15 = 135\).

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is \(\boxed{135}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat holds one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy 20 drinks and 20 sets of snacks (each set containing 3 snacks).

The cost of the drinks is:

\[ 20 \text{ drinks} \times \$2 \text{ per drink} = \$40 \]

The cost of the snacks is:

\[ 20 \text{ sets of snacks} \times 3 \text{ snacks per set} \times \$2 \text{ per snack} = 20 \times 3 \times 2 = \$120 \]

Adding the cost of the drinks and the snacks together gives:

\[ \$40 + \$120 = \$160 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is:

\[
\boxed{160}
\]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Substituting the known values for Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, we get:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Simplifying the left side, we find:

\[ 8800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

To find Gary's truck capacity, we subtract 8800 from 11600:

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 - 8800 = 2800 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of gravel that Gary's truck can carry is:

\[ \boxed{2800} \]"
"To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the number of dumplings eaten by the males and the females separately and then sum them up.

   - There are 6 females.
   - Each female ate 3 dumplings.

2. **Total dumplings eaten by females:**
   \[
   6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings per female} = 18 \text{ dumplings}
   \]

3. **Number of males and dumplings each ate:**
   - There are 8 males, including Larry.
   - Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.

4. **Total dumplings eaten by males:**
   \[
   8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings per male} = 32 \text{ dumplings}
   \]

5. **Total dumplings cooked:**
   \[
   18 \text{ dumplings (females)} + 32 \text{ dumplings (males)} = 50 \text{ dumplings}
   \]

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are \(3 + 2 = 5\).

Gerald's share is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of $100:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60
\]

So, Gerald received $60.

Gerald then spent $10 on a book. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount spent from his initial share:
\[
60 - 10 = 50
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Gerald has left is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second. Therefore, the speed of the turtle is:

\[ \text{Speed of the turtle} = \frac{\text{Speed of the cat}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. Since the turtle's speed is 3 feet/second, the distance it can crawl in 40 seconds is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl \(\boxed{120}\) feet in 40 seconds."
"To determine how many additional hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to calculate the remaining amount they need to raise. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. Therefore, the remaining amount is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much they raise per hour. From the information given, in the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. So, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200 at a rate of $700 per hour. This can be calculated as:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Therefore, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

So, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes:**
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water.
   - 80% of this 40% is used for industrial purposes.
   - Therefore, the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes is:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40\% = 32\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the percentage of the river's water used for non-industrial purposes:**
   - The total water used by the city is 40%.
   - The industrial water usage is 32%.
   - Therefore, the non-industrial water usage is:
     \[
     40\% - 32\% = 8\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is \(\boxed{8\%}\)."

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then sum the amounts produced in the given time.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for both types of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream:
  \[
  50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
  \]
- For vanilla ice cream:
  \[
  12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Finally, we sum the total production of both types of ice cream:
\[
2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is:

\[ 15.00 + 10.00 + 12.00 + 13.00 = 50.00 \]

Now, Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount on his purchase. We need to calculate 10% of the total cost and then subtract it from the total cost.

10% of $50.00:
\[ 0.10 \times 50.00 = 5.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 50.00 - 5.00 = 45.00 \]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:
\[ \boxed{45.00} \]"
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy each eat in two weeks.

Two weeks consist of 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Initially, both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, the amount of candy each has left is:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Ginger} \]
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Amy} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps per minute for each foot:
- When her arms are down, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute.
- When her arms are raised, she taps each foot at 200 taps per minute.

Next, we need to determine the time spent in each state:
- Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes.
- Her arms are raised for 2 minutes, and her arms are down for the remaining 3 minutes.

Now, we calculate the total taps for each foot:

**Right Foot:**
- Taps per minute when arms are down: 300
- Taps per minute when arms are raised: 200
- Time with arms down: 3 minutes
- Time with arms raised: 2 minutes

Total taps for the right foot:
\[ 300 \, \text{taps/min} \times 3 \, \text{min} + 200 \, \text{taps/min} \times 2 \, \text{min} = 900 + 400 = 1300 \, \text{taps} \]

**Left Foot:**
- Taps per minute when arms are down: 250
- Taps per minute when arms are raised: 200
- Time with arms down: 3 minutes
- Time with arms raised: 2 minutes

Total taps for the left foot:
\[ 250 \, \text{taps/min} \times 3 \, \text{min} + 200 \, \text{taps/min} \times 2 \, \text{min} = 750 + 400 = 1150 \, \text{taps} \]

Finally, we sum the taps from both feet:
\[ 1300 \, \text{taps} + 1150 \, \text{taps} = 2450 \, \text{taps} \]

Thus, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is:
\[

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to compare the cost of the city council's fine and the cost of materials to the potential damage to his car.

1. **Calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself:**
   - Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
   - Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: 120 dollars.
   - Total cost: \(75 + 120 = 195\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the potential damage to Ron's car:**
   - Potential damage: 450 dollars.

3. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Savings = Potential damage - Total cost of fixing the pothole.
   - Savings = \(450 - 195 = 255\) dollars.

Therefore, Ron saves \(\boxed{255}\) dollars by fixing the pothole."
"To determine the number of chairs left in the restaurant, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of normal chairs left after some were sent for repair.
2. Calculate the number of baby chairs left after some were sent for repair.
3. Add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs together.

First, let's find out how many normal chairs are left:
- Initially, there are 170 normal chairs.
- 20 normal chairs were sent for repair.
- Therefore, the number of normal chairs left is \(170 - 20 = 150\).

Next, let's find out how many baby chairs are left:
- Initially, there are 23 baby chairs.
- 13 baby chairs were sent for repair.
- Therefore, the number of baby chairs left is \(23 - 13 = 10\).

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs together:
- The number of normal chairs left is 150.
- The number of baby chairs left is 10.
- Therefore, the total number of chairs left is \(150 + 10 = 160\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]

Since three people ate 8 slices each, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the other two friends. Each of these two people ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Since two people ate 9 slices each, the total number of slices eaten by the other two friends is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages, and the dog can do this in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the cat's time.

\[ \text{Time for dog} = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the time it takes for the cat and the dog and then dividing by 2.

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher’s shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby’s shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed with the following equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these cars is:
\[
16 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these cars is:
\[
24 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars:
\[
64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[
\boxed{112}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000

2. **People who voted by midday (12:00)**:
   - By midday, \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by midday = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000\)

3. **Remaining people after midday**:
   - Remaining people = Total people - People who voted by midday
   - Remaining people = 5000 - 2000 = 3000

4. **People who voted by 16:00**:
   - By 16:00, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00 = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000\)

5. **Remaining people who had not voted by 16:00**:
   - Remaining people = Remaining people after midday - People who voted by 16:00
   - Remaining people = 3000 - 2000 = 1000

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is \(\boxed{1000}\)."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the number of pieces per pack.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum are required. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need \(\boxed{8}\) packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:

- Each of the 9 kids wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- Each of the 6 adults will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
- Therefore, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\).

Next, we need to determine how many graham cracker sleeves are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores by the number of smores each sleeve can make:

\[
\frac{24}{8} = 3 \text{ sleeves}
\]

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, they will need 1 box of graham crackers to make 24 smores.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. Given that Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age. Since Dora's mother is four years younger than her father:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

- Cindy's math and science books each weigh 2 pounds. Since there are two books, the total weight for these is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- Her French book weighs 4 pounds.
- Her English book weighs 3 pounds.
- Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, we add up the weights of all the books:

\[
4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is \(\boxed{17}\) pounds."
"First, let's determine how many votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we calculate:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we first find 50% of candidate A's votes and then add that to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{50% of candidate A's votes} = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Thus, candidate C received 50 votes. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we calculate Beck's apples as follows:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck now has 3 fewer apples than Boris. The final numerical answer is:

   3 \text{ giant cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   \[
   7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   \[
   8 \text{ small cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Next, we add up the total amount of water used:
\[
12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find the daily savings. The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each and now buys them for $0.40 each. The difference in price per tomato is:
\[ 0.50 - 0.40 = 0.10 \text{ dollars per tomato} \]

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so the daily savings are:
\[ 500 \times 0.10 = 50 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly savings. There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings are:
\[ 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Therefore, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Cal has:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Carl has. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} \]

"First, we determine how many students are in each of the six groups when fifty-four students are divided equally among them. This is calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

So, each of the six groups has 9 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for each of the 12 groups if the activity requires 12 groups. Since the total number of students remains the same (54), we divide 54 by 12:

\[ \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

This means each of the 12 groups would have 4.5 students. However, since we cannot have half a student in a group, we need to determine how many more groups are needed to accommodate all 54 students if we are to form 12 groups of equal size.

To find out how many more groups are needed, we first calculate the total number of groups required to have whole numbers of students in each group. Since 54 students divided by 4.5 students per group gives us exactly 12 groups, we need to see how many groups are already formed and how many more are needed to reach 12 groups.

Currently, there are 6 groups. To find out how many more groups are needed:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, the number of additional groups needed is:

- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

So, the number of chairs rented during weekdays in one week is:
\[ 60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ chairs} \]

And the number of chairs rented during weekends in one week is:
\[ 100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ chairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of chairs rented in one week is:
\[ 300 \text{ chairs} + 200 \text{ chairs} = 500 \text{ chairs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are rented in two 4-week months. Since each 4-week month consists of 4 weeks, two 4-week months consist of:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is:
\[ 500 \text{ chairs/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 4000 \text{ chairs} \]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bananas Gunther has in the end.

1. Initially, Gunther has 48 bananas.
2. Arnold steals half of the bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas stolen} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 48 - 24 = 24
   \]
3. The next day, Gunther adds 25 more bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas after adding} = 24 + 25 = 49
   \]
4. Arnold steals 12 bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 49 - 12 = 37
   \]
5. On the third day, Gunther adds another 6 bananas:
   \[
   \text{Final number of bananas} = 37 + 6 = 43
   \]

So, the final number of bananas Gunther has is:
\[
\boxed{43}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the monthly share for each roommate:

Total monthly electricity bill = $100
Number of roommates = 4

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly electricity bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

Next, we calculate the annual share for each roommate:

Number of months in a year = 12

Annual share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * Number of months in a year
Annual share per roommate = $25 * 12
Annual share per roommate = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- Glasses: 8 dozen = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- Plates: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Next, we account for the items that were broken:

- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

Now, we subtract the broken items from the initial amounts to find out how many are left:

- Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42 plates

Finally, we add the remaining glasses and plates together to get the total number of items Jeff has now:

- Total remaining items: 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items

**Final numerical answer:**
128"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = \(27 / 3 = 9\) large buttons.
   - After trading, she has \(40 + 9 = 49\) large buttons and \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers.
   - 50% of 49 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 49 = 24.5\). Since the number of stickers must be an integer, we assume she trades 24 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 24 large stickers = 24 large buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 24 large buttons = \(24 \times 3 = 72\) small buttons.
   - After trading, she has \(49 - 24 = 25\) large buttons and \(3 + 72 = 75\) small stickers.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 25 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 25 large stickers = 25 large buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 25 large buttons = \(25 \times 3 = 75\) small buttons.
   - After trading, she has \(75 + 75 = 150\) small buttons.

5. **Final Count of Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 150 small buttons and 0 large buttons.

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day.

1. On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
2. On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
3. On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we sum the matches from each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is given as 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into this expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-Small (XS) Shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of small shirts = \(2 \times 11 = 22\).

3. **Medium (M) Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = \(22 - 4 = 18\).

4. **Large (L) Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).

5. **Extra-Large (XL) Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75
\]

Therefore, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is:

\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is:

\[ 60000 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine how many people think horse #2 will win. Since 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. This leaves:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

people who do not think horse #2 will win. Out of these 40 people, 60% think horse #7 will win. So, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

This means 24 people think horse #7 will win. The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the 40 people who do not think horse #2 will win:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

So, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{3}P = 6
\]

To find \( P \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:
\[
P = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we know that two thirds of Jana's total puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( T \). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\frac{2}{3}T = 18
\]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[
T = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
\]

Thus, the total number of puppies Jana has is:
\[
\boxed{27}

\]

Next, we add the amount Jayden originally had to the amount given by Ava:

\[
\text{Total amount Jayden has} = 70 + 45 = 115
\]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:

\[
\text{Amount needed} = 200 - 115 = 85
\]

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second house).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first house).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To determine the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance covered by driving and the distance covered by hiking, then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance covered by driving:
- The driving speed is 50 miles per hour.
- The time spent driving is \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours (since they spent 1.5 hours hiking).

The distance covered by driving is:
\[
\text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 225 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance covered by hiking:
- The hiking speed is \( \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.
- The time spent hiking is 1.5 hours.

The distance covered by hiking is:
\[
\text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
\]

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 225 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 255 \, \text{miles}

- Let \( A_t \) be the time Ava takes to finish the level in seconds. According to the problem, \( A_t = E_t + 4 \).

The points for each player can be calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times \text{time taken} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E = 215 \]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Cost of Pizzas**: The total cost for the four pizzas is $64.

2. **Cost of Two Pizzas**: Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total.

3. **Cost of Remaining Pizzas**: Subtract the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost to find the cost of the remaining two pizzas.
   \[
   64 - 30 = 34
   \]

4. **Cost per Remaining Pizza**: Since the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2.
   \[
   \frac{34}{2} = 17
   \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

**Final Answer**: Each of the other two pizzas cost $17."
"To determine how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Calculate the number of rides on the 5 usual days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day on these 5 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of rides on these 5 days is:
     \[
     3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of rides on the 2 special days:**
   - On these 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) rides per day.
   - Therefore, the total number of rides on these 2 days is:
     \[
     6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rides in a week:**
   - Add the rides from the usual days and the special days:
     \[
     15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}
     \]

Thus, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]

Rearranging terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \), we get:

\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]

\[ -3W = -12 \]

Divide both sides by -3:

\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):

\[ O = 17 - 4 = 13 \]

To verify, we check the condition that after buying the fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:

\[ 3 + 13 = 16 \]
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Since \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"

"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
So, the total number of tomatoes is:
\[ 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} \times 5 \text{ plants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
So, the total number of eggplants is:
\[ 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Now, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
\[ 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits} \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

2. Determine how much the school will contribute.
3. Calculate how much John still needs after the school's contribution.

First, the total cost of the trip is $300. The school will cover half of this cost:
\[ \text{School's contribution} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Next, we need to find out how much John still needs after the school's contribution. John has $50, so we subtract the school's contribution from the total cost and then subtract John's contribution:
\[ \text{Amount John needs} = 300 - 150 - 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John is missing is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, we need to determine the temperature inside the house during the night. If it is 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Therefore, the temperature needs to be raised from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. The difference in temperature is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood burns and raises the temperature by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees is:

"First, we need to determine how many groups of 9 people can be formed from 90 people. This is calculated by dividing 90 by 9:

\[
\frac{90}{9} = 10
\]

So, there are 10 groups.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups each brought back 2 seashells. According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups brought back seashells. Therefore, we calculate \(\frac{3}{5}\) of 10:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]

So, 6 groups each brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells brought back, we multiply the number of groups that brought seashells by the number of seashells each group brought:

\[
6 \times 2 = 12
\]

Thus, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[
\boxed{12}

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks (14 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the first 2 weeks} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours she plays in the second part of her schedule. She plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week (7 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the next week} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we add the hours from both parts of her schedule to find the total hours she has played so far.

\[ \text{Total hours played} = 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours.

Therefore, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the second car:**

   \]

3. **Determine the separation between the two cars:**
   - The second car is faster, so it will be ahead of the first car.
   - The separation distance is the difference between the distances traveled by the second car and the first car.
   \[
   \text{Separation} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, the separation between the two cars after 2 hours is \(\boxed{20}\) miles."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the materials before the premium is added. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300, so the total cost of the materials is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on this total cost. A 30% premium means that James pays an additional 30% of $900. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add this premium to the original cost of the materials to find the total amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final amount James paid is:

\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's determine the number of students who passed in each grade:

1. **Third Graders:**
   - Number of third-graders: 500
   - Number of third-graders who passed: 340

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - Number of fourth-graders: 100
   - Number of fourth-graders who passed: 40

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - Number of fifth-graders: 400
   - Pass rate for fifth graders: Twice the fourth graders' pass rate
   - Fourth graders' pass rate: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \) or 40%
   - Fifth graders' pass rate: \( 2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \) or 80%
   - Number of fifth-graders who passed: \( 400 \times 0.8 = 320 \)

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 680 \)
- Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

Now, we find the overall pass rate:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total number of students who passed}}{\text{Total number of students}} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68 \]

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:**
   - Each bag contains 72 glass chips.
   - Milo has 2 bags.
   \[
   72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips}
   \]

2. **Determine how many glass chips are needed for one square inch of the mosaic:**
   - It takes 12 glass chips to make one square inch.

3. **Calculate the total area of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 glass chips:**
   \[
   \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}
   \]

4. **Determine the dimensions of the mosaic:**
   - The mosaic is 3 inches tall.
   - Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches.
   - The area of the mosaic is given by:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches}
   \]
   - We know the area is 12 square inches.
   \[
   L \times 3 = 12
   \]

5. **Solve for \( L \):**
   \[
   L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]

Thus, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. 

\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies and ended up selling 150. After selling these, he ordered an additional 100 candies.

First, calculate the number of candies Dale has after selling 150:
\[ 100 - 150 = -50 \]
This means he is 50 candies short of the initial order after selling 150.

Next, he ordered 100 more candies, so we add these to the remaining deficit:
\[ -50 + 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, Dale now has 50 candies and has already sold 150. To find out how many more he needs to sell to have sold all his candies, we need to consider the total number of candies he now has:
\[ 150 \text{ (sold)} + 50 \text{ (remaining)} = 200 \text{ (total candies)} \]

Since he has already sold 150, the number of candies he still needs to sell is:
\[ 200 - 150 = 50 \]

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then determine the total number of students by the end of May.

1. **Beginning of the year (January 1st):** 10 students
2. **End of January:** The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
3. **End of February:** The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
4. **End of March:** The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
5. **End of April:** The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
6. **End of May:** The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we need to find out how many additional students have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

The number of students at the beginning of the year is 10. By the end of May, there are 320 students. The additional number of students is:
\[ 320 - 10 = 310 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

   - Therefore, the average number of branches climbed per day is:
     \[
     \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
     \]

So, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of petals in the vase.

1. **Initial Flowers and Petals:**
   - Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
     \[
     4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - She picks another 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
     \[
     5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
     \[
     6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
     \]

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   - Summing up all the petals:
     \[
     15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
     \]

3. **Flowers and Petals Lost:**
   - Rose drops 1 of each type of flower she picked:
     - 1 flower with 5 petals
     - 1 flower with 6 petals
     - 1 flower with 4 petals
     - 1 flower with 7 petals
   - Total petals lost:
     \[
     5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}
     \]

4. **Remaining Petals in the Vase:**
   - Subtract the lost petals from the total petals:
     \[
     101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals}
     \]

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used and dropped:

1. John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
2. DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
3. They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

The total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:
\[ 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag is 35. After using and dropping some, the number of marshmallows left is:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each can have:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Final answer:
7"
"To determine how much money Jack and his friends use, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then convert that into the number of quarters required.

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - Total time Jack plays: 4 hours = 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

2. **First Friend's Play Time:**
   - This friend can play for half as long as Jack, so 10 minutes per quarter.
   - Total time this friend plays: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Number of quarters this friend uses: \( \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

3. **Second Friend's Play Time:**
   - This friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so 30 minutes per quarter.
   - Total time this friend plays: \( 1.5 \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Number of quarters this friend uses: \( \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - First friend: 12 quarters

"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \).
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil (in ounces).

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt: \( o = 2s \).
2. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest: \( s = 2z \).

We also know that the total amount of all ingredients fills a 10-ounce jar, so we can write the equation:
\[ o + z + z + s + s = 10 \]
Simplifying, we get:
\[ o + 2z + 2s = 10 \]

Now, substitute \( s = 2z \) and \( o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \) into the equation:
\[ 4z + 2z + 2(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 4z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now that we know \( z = 1 \), we can find the other quantities:
\[ s = 2z = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{4}\) ounces."
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
\[
3 \text{ goats} \times \$500 \text{ per goat} = \$1500
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
\[
2 \text{ cows} \times \$1500 \text{ per cow} = \$3000
\]

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:
\[
\$1500 + \$3000 = \$4500
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is \(\boxed{4500}\)."
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. To find out how many more cupcakes he needs to buy, we add the cupcakes he already has and subtract this total from 63.

First, we calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul currently has:
\[ 8 \text{ (chocolate)} + 40 \text{ (toffee)} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we determine how many more cupcakes he needs to buy by subtracting the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number needed:
\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

Therefore, Paul should buy \(\boxed{15}\) more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. Initially, Joe had 40 cars. After selling 8 cars and giving away 16 cars, the number of cars he remains with is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each of the 20 students raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the first day in hours.
2. Calculate the time she walked on the second day in hours.
3. Convert the total time walked over the two days into minutes.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

Next, we calculate the time she walked on the second day. Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day, we have:
\[ \text{Time on the second day} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we find the total time walked over the two days in hours:
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we use the fact that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ \text{Total time in minutes} = 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"

"To determine how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tins of cat food.
2. Calculate the total number of tins of dog food.
3. Find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and the total number of tins of dog food.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package of cat food contains 11 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is \(8 \times 11 = 88\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package of dog food contains 6 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we isolate \( P \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Then, we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, the number of cards Becca has is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

So, the amount of money Roy has is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, 480 inches = \( \frac{480}{12} \) feet = 40 feet.

Thus, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each segment of his journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance: \( 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 6 hours
   - Distance: \( 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \)

3. **Total Distance:**
   - Sum of distances from both segments: \( 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \)

Therefore, the total distance Mason has traveled is **80 miles**."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the same highway, given their speed relative to that of the kangaroos.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can denote the distance of the highway as \( D \) and the speed of each kangaroo as \( v \). The total speed of the 3 kangaroos combined is \( 3v \). Since they travel the distance \( D \) in 18 hours, we can write the equation for the distance as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 \]
\[ D = 54v \]

Now, let's consider the speed of the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). If we have four turtles, their combined speed is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

We need to find the time \( t \) it takes for the four turtles to travel the same distance \( D \). Using the distance formula \( D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \), we can write:
\[ D = 2v \times t \]
Since we know \( D = 54v \), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[ 54v = 2v \times t \]
We can cancel \( v \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( v \neq 0 \)):
\[ 54 = 2t \]
Solving for \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, it will take the four turtles \(\boxed{27}\) hours to travel across the highway."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of clay dishes each person made and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of dishes Kora made:**
   Kora made 20 dishes.

2. **Determine the number of dishes Rory made:**
   Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora. Since Kora made 20 dishes:
   \[
   \text{Number of dishes Rory made} = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine the number of dishes Jada made:**
   Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory. Since Rory made 40 dishes:
   \[
   \text{Number of dishes Jada made} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of dishes made by all three:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of dishes} = \text{Dishes made by Jada} + \text{Dishes made by Rory} + \text{Dishes made by Kora}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of dishes} = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140
   \]

Thus, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:
\[
\boxed{140}

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the reduced price of the new laptop after trading in her old laptop.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her part-time job, and the money from her mom.
3. Use the information that she still needs $50 to find out how much she already has.

First, the reduced price of the new laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). According to the problem, the total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her part-time job, and the money from her mom, is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

We know that after adding this total amount to the $50 she still needs, she will have enough to buy the laptop. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, the total number of slices from the large apples is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, the total number of slices from the small apples is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Adding these together, the total number of apple slices Adam has is \(15 + 15 = 30\) slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

He wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional amount of milk needed is:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue that is not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these amounts.

1. **First glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Unused portion: \(1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}\)
   - Length of unused glue: \(\frac{5}{6} \times 12 = 10\) millimeters

2. **Second glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Unused portion: \(1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\)
   - Length of unused glue: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4\) millimeters

3. **Third glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Unused portion: \(1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\)
   - Length of unused glue: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6\) millimeters

Now, we sum the lengths of the unused glue from all three glue sticks:
\[10 + 4 + 6 = 20\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is \(\boxed{20}\) millimeters."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gabriel wants to buy:

- Car: $10000
- Phone: $800

Total cost = $10000 + $800 = $10800

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:

- Money from working on weekends: $5000
- Money from his brother: $200

Total money Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, to find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the total money he has from the total cost of the items:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Gabriel has
Money needed = $10800 - $5200 = $5600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig starts with. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he starts with:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Adding these together, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 180 \)."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the given information and categorize the students accordingly.

1. There are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students perform well in English only.
4. The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since there are 20 students in total and 5 are good at math only and 8 are good at English only, the number of students who are good at both can be found by subtracting the number of students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, 7 students are good at both math and English.

Next, we find the total number of students who are good at math. This includes those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English:

\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group requires and then see how many such groups can fit into the 2-hour concert duration, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group needs:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Available time for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Finally, we divide the available time by the time each group needs to find out how many groups can perform:
- Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11."
"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 202.50 = 502.50 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{502.50} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.
2. Half of the white shirts have collars. Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
3. This means the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).
4. Out of the 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons. Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer will use to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs of shoes to find the average cost per pair.

First, we know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs of shoes:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, the average cost per pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

   - Therefore, the total cost for 3 baskets of green food is:
     \[
     3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food.
   - Therefore, the cost per basket of red food after the discount is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Year**: The town will build 12 homes.
2. **Second Year**: They will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. **Third Year**: They will build double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they will build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's sum up the total number of homes built over the three years:
- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

Adding these together gives:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

So, the total number of homes built over the next three years is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals mentioned in the problem:

- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( I \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. You are three years younger than your brother:
   \[
   I = B - 3
   \]

2. You are two years older than your sister:
   \[
   M = I - 2
   \]

3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age:
   \[
   \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1
   \]

4. The sum of all their ages is 87:
   \[
   I + M + B + (3B - 1) = 87
   \]

First, substitute the expressions for \( I \) and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation:

\[
(B - 3) + (B - 3 - 2) + B + (3B - 1) = 87
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
B - 3 + B - 5 + B + 3B - 1 = 87
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
6B - 9 = 87
\]

Add 9 to both sides:

\[
6B = 96
\]

Divide by 6:

\[
B = 16
\]

Now, substitute \( B = 16 \) back into the expression for \( I \):

\[
I = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for the class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find the number of packs required, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs to ensure he has enough glue sticks. To confirm, 6 packs would only provide:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 8 \text{ glue sticks/pack} = 48 \text{ glue sticks} \]

This is not enough since he needs 54 glue sticks. Therefore, he needs 7 packs to have at least 56 glue sticks, which is more than enough and ensures he has some extra glue sticks.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the changes in the amount of water passing through the river step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After Heavy Rain:**
   After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. Therefore, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Increase on the Third Day:**
   On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}

"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total amount as follows:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Therefore, Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela. So, we subtract $80 from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ \boxed{1520} \]"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

- She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges.

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. Therefore, in a year (which has 12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, which means Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Therefore, in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a year."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the number of banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount raised is:

"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has \(70 - 30 = 40\) silver coins.

To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we add the number of gold coins to the number of silver coins:

\[70 + 40 = 110\]

Therefore, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins."
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate to the total consumed by the students.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.

First, calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students:
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is \(50 \times 10 = 500\).

Next, add the number of burritos Mr. George ate to the total consumed by the students:
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.
- Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed is \(500 + 20 = 520\).

Finally, subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered:
- The initial number of burritos ordered is 600.
- Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos is \(600 - 520 = 80\).

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. So, the number of green cars = 12 - 2 = 10.
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. So, the number of blue cars = 3 * 10 = 30.
4. The total number of cars in the rink is 75.

To find the number of yellow cars, we need to subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.

Total number of cars = Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars + Number of yellow cars

So, we can write the equation as:

75 = 12 + 10 + 30 + Number of yellow cars

Now, let's solve for the number of yellow cars:

75 = 52 + Number of yellow cars

Number of yellow cars = 75 - 52 = 23

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."
"To determine the weight of the carrots Daisy bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the weight of the bag of potatoes.
2. Calculate the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes.
3. Determine the weight of the bag of carrots based on the weight of the sweet potatoes.

Step 1: The weight of the bag of potatoes is given as 5 pounds.

Step 2: The weight of the bag of sweet potatoes is 2 times the weight of the bag of potatoes. Therefore, we calculate:
\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 3: The weight of the bag of carrots is 3 pounds fewer than the weight of the sweet potatoes. Therefore, we calculate:
\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the weight of the carrots Daisy bought is \(\boxed{7}\) pounds."
"First, let's determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of cups needed is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 3-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 cups. Since 3 ounces of jello make 10 cups, we can calculate the number of boxes needed as follows:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Since each box is on sale for $1.25, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Greg will spend on jello is:

So, the seller will give back $500 in change. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$500 \]"
"First, we need to determine how much Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the total cost:

\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400 and there are 4 weeks in a month, we can find out how much Keenan spends per week by dividing his monthly contribution by 4:

\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

So, Keenan spends \(\boxed{40}\) dollars per week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far.

1. **Total pieces of pizza**: 60 pieces.

2. **Pieces eaten on the first day**: 
   \[

   \]

3. **Remaining pieces after the first day**:
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Pieces eaten on the second day**:
   \[
   10 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Remaining pieces after the second day**:
   \[

\[
\text{Hourly rate} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how much she would earn if she worked for 12 hours at this rate. We do this by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours she plans to work:

\[
\text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132
\]

Therefore, Ella would earn \(\boxed{132}\) dollars after 12 hours of dog walking."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Paul starts with 52 marbles.
2. His friend gives him 28 more marbles. So, the total number of marbles Paul has now is:
   \[
   52 + 28 = 80
   \]
3. Paul then loses \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he loses, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
   \]
4. To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had after receiving more from his friend:

Next, let's determine the cost of a new rope at $1.5 per meter. Since Sarah plans to use the profit to buy a new rope of the same length (20 meters), we calculate the cost as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of new rope} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from Sarah's total earnings to find out how much money she will have left over:

\[ \text{Money left over} = \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

Therefore, Sarah will have \(\boxed{10}\) dollars left over after she buys the new rope."
"First, let's determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, then her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be 24. Since she is currently 8 years old, in \( x \) years, she will be:

\[ 8 + x \]

We set this equal to 24 and solve for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the costs of each item Kelly is purchasing:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly buys 5 packs of bacon for a total of $10. Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Therefore, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Since she has 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. Therefore, the cost per pack of apples is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. Therefore, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \(\boxed{25}\) minutes."

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones will not be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He also counts \( \frac{2}{3} \) of that number of birds flying overhead. Since he counted 6 birds nesting, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 6 is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
   \]
   So, 4 birds are flying overhead.
3. He counts 3 groups of eight birds each feeding. Therefore, the total number of birds in these groups is:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry counts:
\[
6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34
\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:
\[
\boxed{34}
\]"
"Lani started with 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies, so the number of cookies left is:

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

Next, she placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies are in each jar, we divide 50 by 5:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, the number of cookies in each jar is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We do this by subtracting the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[
\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
\]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Therefore, the number of outdoor plants is:

\[
\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[
\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
\]

To find the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine the speed at which a whirligig spins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the speed of the thingamabob.
2. Use the speed of the thingamabob to find the speed of the whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11:

\[
\text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

\[
\text{Speed of whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Thus, the speed at which a whirligig spins is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."
"To determine the cost of one carrot, let's break down the information given:

1. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
2. The salad costs $6.
3. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
4. The total cost for her daily goods is $11.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( C \). Since she eats two carrots each day, the cost for the carrots is \( 2C \).

The total cost for her daily goods can be expressed as:
\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot is $1.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 an hour and received a raise of $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount Mark makes a week is:

\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that amount from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Then, the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3J \).
- Let \( A \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.
- Then, the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn the second week is \( \frac{A}{5} \).

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for each mowing, we can set up the following equations based on the payments:
1. For the first week: \( 6 \times 3J + 6 \times J = 18J + 6J = 24J \)
2. For the second week: \( 6 \times \frac{A}{5} = \frac{6A}{5} \)

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is the sum of the amounts from both weeks:
\[ 24J + \frac{6A}{5} \]

We know that Tasha's total earnings from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns last month were $80. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade} + 24J + \frac{6A}{5} = 80 \]

To find the earnings from lemonade, we need to determine the values of \( J \) and \( A \). However, the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact values of \( J \) and \( A \) individually, but we can express the earnings from lemonade in terms of these variables and the total earnings.

Since the problem does not give specific values for \( J \) and \( A \), we can assume the simplest case where the payments for mowing lawns are consistent and do not require further breakdown. Given the total earnings and the payment structure, we can directly calculate the earnings from lemonade by subtracting the mowing earnings from the total earnings.

If we assume the simplest consistent scenario where the mowing payments are straightforward and do not require complex fractions (since the problem does not specify otherwise), we can use the total earnings directly:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 - (24J + \frac{6A}{5}) \]

Given the problem's structure and the need for a numerical answer, we can infer that the mowing payments are consistent and do not require further breakdown. Therefore, the earnings from lemonade are:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 - (24J + \frac{6A}{5}) \]

Since the problem does not provide specific values for \( J \) and \( A \), we can assume the simplest consistent scenario where the mowing payments are straightforward. Therefore, the earnings from lemonade are:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 - (24J + \frac{6A}{5}) = 80 - 24 \times 1 - \frac{6 \times 5}{5} = 80 - 24 - 6 = 50 \]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Thus, the weight of Harry is \(\boxed{74}\) kg."
"To determine John's profit from renting out his car, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours John rents his car each month:**
   \[
   \text{Number of times rented} \times \text{Hours per rental} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings from renting the car:**
   \[
   \text{Total hours} \times \text{Hourly rate} = 30 \times 25 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} - \text{Car payment} = 750 - 500 = 250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting his car is:
\[
\boxed{250}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, we can calculate the number of notebooks she originally had as follows:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Therefore, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph after she bought the additional 5 notebooks. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has \(\boxed{1}\) more notebook than Joseph."
"First, let's calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we calculate Anis's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + \left( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \right) = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance rowed on that day:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took 4 cookies. Initially, Susan made 100 cookies. After her husband took 4 cookies, the number of cookies left is:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Next, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we perform the division:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get \(\boxed{16}\) cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each read over the two days:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

**Final Answer:**
15"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls or
- 8 child bowls

Calvin and his wife are both adults, and they have two children. If everyone eats one bowl at the meal, the total number of bowls needed for the family is:
- 2 adult bowls (for Calvin and his wife) + 2 child bowls (for the children) = 4 bowls

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, we can see that the total amount of soup in the pot is equivalent to 4 adult bowls. This means the pot contains enough soup for 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

Now, let's calculate the leftover soup after the family has eaten:
- The family eats 4 bowls in total.
- The pot has 4 adult bowls worth of soup, which is equivalent to 8 child bowls.

After the family eats, the leftover soup is:
- 4 adult bowls - 4 bowls eaten = 0 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls - 4 bowls eaten = 4 child bowls

Since the leftover soup is 4 child bowls, and there are 2 children, each child will be able to have:
- 4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 bowls

Therefore, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"To determine how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

First, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- William bought 5 notebooks.

\[
\text{Cost of notebooks} = 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.
- William bought 1 ballpen.

\[
\text{Cost of ballpen} = 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
\]

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00
\]

Therefore, William spent a total of \(\boxed{8.00}\)."
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the material needed for the small masks and the material needed for the large masks.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Now, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

Therefore, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."

"First, let's break down Harold's daily activities and calculate the time spent on each:

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ hours (sleeping)} + 8 \text{ hours (working)} + 1 \text{ hour (walking the dog)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} - 19 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses and how many are left:

- Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes.
- He uses 3 blue shoe boxes for fishing.

Next, let's determine how many red shoe boxes Tim uses and how many are left:

- Tim starts with 9 red shoe boxes.
- He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes for fishing.
- Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes used is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3\).
- Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is \(9 - 3 = 6\).

So, the final number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box is 4 blue and 6 red.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
4 \text{ blue shoe boxes and } 6 \text{ red shoe boxes}

"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Duncan and Adam as \( D \) and \( A \) respectively. According to the problem, Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. Therefore, we have:

\[ D = 60 \]

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be \(\boxed{38}\) years old in 8 years."
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of acres for both farms combined. We add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. This can be calculated as:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny throws 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total pieces of bologna as:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( \boxed{6} \)."
"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs in a 30-day month, we can follow these steps:

"First, let's calculate the calorie content for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

1. **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
   - Therefore, each mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
   - Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) calories.

2. **Mini Blueberry Muffins:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
   - Therefore, each mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
   - Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: \( 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \) calories.

3. **Total Calories:**

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Junebugs removed on Monday:**
   \[
   39
   \]

2. **Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   Since she removed twice as many Junebugs as on Monday each day:
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ (for Tuesday)}
   \]
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ (for Wednesday)}
   \]

3. **Junebugs removed on Thursday:**
   \[
   48
   \]

4. **Junebugs removed on Friday:**
   \[
   57
   \]

Next, we sum the Junebugs removed each day to find the total:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

The total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Now, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"First, calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
- The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, calculate the distance traveled by the car:
- The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, find out how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car
- Difference in distance = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract this total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

Here are the quantities of the toys:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

First, we sum these quantities:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the sum of the other toys from the total number of toys:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( P + Pa + J = 100 \)
2. \( P = 2J + 10 \)
3. \( Pa = J + 10 \)

Substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) from the second and third equations into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, substitute \( J = 20 \) back into the equations for \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons given to her friends initially is:
   \[
   4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons}
   \]

2. Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself. So, the total number of balloons Maria had initially is:
   \[
   8 \text{ balloons} + 1 \text{ balloon} = 9 \text{ balloons}
   \]

3. Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons given is:
   \[
   5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons}
   \]

4. Adding the additional balloons to the initial total, the total number of balloons they have now is:
   \[
   9 \text{ initial balloons} + 15 \text{ additional balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons}
   \]

So, the total number of balloons the girls have is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff that the charity group has:

- 10 people donate 5 boxes each: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes.
- They already have 10 boxes.

So, the total number of boxes is \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes:

- Total boxes / Boxes per table = \(60 / 2 = 30\) tables.

Since they already own 15 tables, we need to find out how many new tables they need:

- New tables needed = Total tables required - Tables they already have = \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables.

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"First, let's determine the total duration of Cameron's stay. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This is a total of 17 hours.

Next, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the initial 12-hour stay and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour. The additional hours are:
\[ 17 - 12 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The cost for the additional hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding the cost of the initial 12-hour stay:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Finally, we find the difference between the two costs to determine how much Cameron saves:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} - 1350 \text{ pesos} = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, Cameron would save:
\[ \boxed{250} \text{ pesos} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. According to the problem, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the hay needed for each sheep as follows:

\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the overall amount of hay Nate needs:

So, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so after the deposit, he will have:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money, we get:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

"To determine the total charge for the job, we need to consider the fixed visit charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Fixed Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: The labor rate is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). Therefore, the labor charge is \(3 \times 35 = 105\) dollars.
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total charge:
\[
40 + 105 + 60 = 205

Thus, the total charge for the job is \(\boxed{205}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

However, since he only sold them for $40 each, the total amount he received from selling these 5 CDs is:

\[ 5 \times \$40 = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out of after selling 5 of the CDs. The total cost of the CDs after the discount is $90, and he received $200 from selling 5 of them. Therefore, the net amount he was out of is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was ""out"" of, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time James took to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   James swims at half the initial speed.
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   Add the time taken to swim the initial distance, the rest time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}

"To determine Cayley's total commission, we need to calculate the commission from each type of newspaper separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies of the New York Times.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 10\% \times 5 = 0.10 \times 5 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 8\% \times 15 = 0.08 \times 15 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

Deanna's age = 26
Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21

Now, since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age.

Leo's age = 2 × Marcus's age = 2 × 21 = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar scored.

We can express these statements as equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

To verify, we check the total points:
\[ B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 \]
The total is correct. Therefore, the number of points Azibo scored is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we start by understanding the given information:

- The paper is stacked such that 100 pages occupy 1 inch.
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page per side.

First, calculate the number of pages per inch:
\[ 100 \text{ pages/inch} \]

Next, calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ 100 \text{ pages/inch} \times 1.5 \text{ inches} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per paper is 2. Therefore, the total number of papers is:
\[ \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages/paper}} = 75 \text{ papers} \]

Thus, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ 150 \text{ pages} \]

"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert this time into minutes because Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he staples is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was in bed and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Total time in bed:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - Calculate the duration: \( 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 \) minutes.

3. **Time Kim was actually sleeping:**
   - Subtract the sleepwalking time from the total time in bed: \( 480 - 23 = 457 \) minutes.

4. **Adjust for the earlier wake-up time:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she was in bed for 5 minutes less than 480 minutes.
   - Adjusted total time in bed: \( 480 - 5 = 475 \) minutes.

5. **Final calculation:**
   - Subtract the sleepwalking time from the adjusted total time in bed: \( 475 - 23 = 452 \) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy Calculation:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of initially occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initially occupied beds = 200.
   - New admissions over 2 weeks = 700.
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity of the hospital = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 900 beds.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

**Final Answer:**
The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails, which are not to family, are to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are sent to her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Finally, we need to determine how many of these 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. The problem states that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate the age of Shawna's father, who is five times as old as Shawna:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"If Courtney reported 48 people in attendance and Kelly says that Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we need to find the actual number of people that attended the concert.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \( 40 \).

Final answer:
\[ 40 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried in terms of Jeffrey's number of balls. Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan. Therefore, the total number of balls is:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then the relationship between the number of balls carried by each boy would still hold. If Jason carried 2 balls, then \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get:
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the expression for the total number of balls, we get:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

So, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

Next, we know that at the end of the first day, they had 10 holes. By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \). According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more corn chips than either Amora or Lainey. Therefore, we can express the number of corn chips Collins received as:

\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of corn chips. This is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:

\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Now, let's perform the addition:

\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

So, the total number of corn chips is:

\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets for travel. The problem states that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the third equation:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

To verify, we can find \( X \) using the second equation:
\[ X = S + 5 \]
\[ X = 147 + 5 \]
\[ X = 152 \]

Finally, we check the total number of Pokemon:
\[ X + S + A = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339 \]
The total is correct, so the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long and that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend watching the show. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

\[
\boxed{200}

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird travels in each direction and then find the net distance.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south and north:
- Net distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Net distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the difference between the distance traveled south and the distance traveled north:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day.

1. **Initial Batch Made by Greta:**
   Greta made one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. **Brownies Sent Home from Office:**
   At her office, she was sent home with half a dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. **Total Brownies Before Surprise Party:**
   Adding the brownies from the office to the initial batch:
   \[
   12 \text{ brownies} + 6 \text{ brownies} = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

4. **Brownies at the Surprise Party:**
   When she arrived home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

5. **Total Brownies Before Party Consumption:**
   Adding the brownies from the surprise party to the total from the office and initial batch:

   18 \text{ brownies} + 48 \text{ brownies} = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

6. **Brownies Eaten During the Party:**
   During the party, 1.5 dozen brownies were eaten.
   \[
   1.5 \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

7. **Brownies Left Over:**
   Subtracting the brownies eaten from the total:
   \[
   66 \text{ brownies} - 18 \text{ brownies} = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Thus, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"First, let's determine the ages of each family member:

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother's age is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. This means her age is 75% of Nani's age. So, her age is \(0.75 \times 8 = 6\) years.

Now, we add up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.

The price of the first two phones is full price, which is $600 each. Therefore, the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price. The half price of each phone is:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

So, the cost for the remaining two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of the first two phones and the remaining two phones gives:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid for all the phones is:

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wood slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 2 \times \text{perimeter} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington then kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

This means she sold the rest of the boxes:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 6 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is:
\[ x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \cdot 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to afford the books. He has already saved $14, so the additional amount needed is:

Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:

Number of hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Number of hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining how many cherries Richard has. According to the problem, Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cherries Richard has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cherries Richard has} = \text{Number of cherries Robert has} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Next, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries that Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries:

\[ \text{Number of cherries Jerry has} = \text{Total number of cherries} - (\text{Number of cherries Richard has} + \text{Number of cherries Robert has}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of cherries Robert has} - \text{Number of cherries Jerry has} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both Saturday and Sunday, and then find the total earnings.

   - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
   - Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

2. **Sunday:**
   - Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
   - Apple pie: 15 boxes

Let's calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday:
- Gingerbread on Sunday: \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes
- Apple pie on Sunday: 15 boxes

Now, we can calculate the total number of boxes sold on each day:
- **Saturday:**
  - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
  - Apple pie: \(15 - 4 = 11\) boxes
  - Total boxes on Saturday: \(10 + 11 = 21\) boxes

- **Sunday:**
  - Gingerbread: 15 boxes
  - Apple pie: 15 boxes
  - Total boxes on Sunday: \(15 + 15 = 30\) boxes

Next, we calculate the earnings for each day:
- **Saturday:**
  - Gingerbread earnings: \(10 \times 6 = 60\) dollars
  - Apple pie earnings: \(11 \times 15 = 165\) dollars
  - Total earnings on Saturday: \(60 + 165 = 225\) dollars

- **Sunday:**
  - Gingerbread earnings: \(15 \times 6 = 90\) dollars
  - Apple pie earnings: \(15 \times 15 = 225\) dollars
  - Total earnings on Sunday: \(90 + 225 = 315\) dollars

Finally, we add the earnings from both days to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings for two days: \(225 + 315 = 540\) dollars

Thus, the total amount Sunny earned for the two days is:

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need to pack, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use:**
   - Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She will be outside for 4 hours each day.
   - Over 8 days, the total number of hours she will be outside is:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is:
     \[
     32 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 32 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of bottles needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.
   - To find out how many bottles are needed, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount per bottle:
     \[
     \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Thus, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"First, let's determine the price of the red car. If the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price and subtract it from the blue car's price.

The price of the blue car is $100. 

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

The total cost of both cars is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

Now, let's determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is:
\[43 + 7 = 50\]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

Now, we add up all the beads:

- Beads from her mother: 20
- Beads from her sister: 30
- Beads from her friend: 40

"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we calculate the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class of 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate 25% of 24:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, we determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes together and then dividing by the number of people:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how much money Pat will spend to fill her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the plants and the spacing to the same unit:**
   - Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is \( \frac{12}{12} = 1 \) foot.
   - The space between each plant is 1.5 feet.

2. **Calculate the total space required for one plant and the space between it and the next plant:**
   - Space for one plant and the space between it and the next plant: \( 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 \) feet.

3. **Determine the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - Number of plants that can fit: \( \frac{111}{2.5} = 44.4 \).
   - Since Pat can only have whole plants, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

4. **Calculate the total number of plants needed:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants.
   - Additional plants needed: \( 44 - 17 = 27 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - Total cost: \( 27 \times 6 = 162 \).

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"First, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by brother in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for each basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket contains 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.
- The cost of one petunia is $3.00.
- The cost of one sweet potato vine is $2.50.

The cost for the petunias in one basket is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

The cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per sweet potato vine} = \$5.00 \]

The total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost for all baskets is:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. Since they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. Since they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations to find the total soil used for these flowers:
\[12 + 15 = 27\] pounds.

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the amount of soil left for planting roses is:
\[30 - 27 = 3\] pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[3 \div 1 = 3\].

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for the shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \text{ pairs} \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, let's calculate how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the problem into two parts: peeling and sautéing.

1. **Peeling Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we calculate the time required as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, we calculate the time required as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to complete both tasks is the sum of the time to peel and the time to sauté:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Air conditioner on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Air conditioner on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour on high.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Warming up: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \( D \).
   - According to the problem, Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. So, \( D = 30 \).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \( 90 - 75 = 15 \) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Similarly, this amounts to:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over a year, this totals:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter (3 months) for the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum all these checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of flights the first plane makes in one day:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips in one day.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's flights:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
   - So, the first plane goes to France and Germany for one-quarter of its flights each.

3. **Calculate the number of flights to France:**
   - One-quarter of the first plane's 88 flights are to France.
   - Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{88}{4} = 22 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl**: Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote's howl**: Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. Therefore, Chikote's howl lasts for \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. **Igneous's howl**: Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined. Therefore, Igneous's howl lasts for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we calculate the total duration of all three wolves' howls combined:
\[
20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[
\frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The total cost of the trousers is $30.
2. Adam's mother gave him $6.
3. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
4. The total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
5. The amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is the total cost of the trousers minus the total amount given by his parents, which is \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. Akbar's age \( A = 3 \) years.
2. Alessandro's age \( B = 4 \) years.
3. The total age of the children is 20 years, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can substitute the known ages of Akbar and Alessandro into the total age equation:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we need to use the information about Helene's age being twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's define the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \) slices. The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices, which is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the total \( 8x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%

So, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon."
"First, let's break down the time Doctor Jones will spend on each activity:

1. **Clinic Work**: 9 hours
2. **Inpatient Rounds**: 10 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient
3. **Appointments**: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment

Now, let's calculate the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:

- **Inpatient Rounds**: \(10 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes} = 200 \text{ minutes}\)
  - Convert minutes to hours: \(200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = \frac{200}{60} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ hours}\)

- **Appointments**: \(10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 300 \text{ minutes}\)
  - Convert minutes to hours: \(300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours}\)

Next, add up the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:

- Total time for inpatient rounds and appointments: \(3.33 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8.33 \text{ hours}\)

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons needed.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The conversion factor is that 1 cubic foot of water is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
\[ G = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 7.48 \, \text{gallons per cubic foot} = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per gallon} = 1047.20 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

   \text{Students over 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

3. **Number of male students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375
   \]

4. **Number of female students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

5. **Number of students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500

"First, let's determine the number of laps each person can run in one hour.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so:
   \[
   \text{Trey's laps} = 10 + 4 = 14
   \]
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so:
   \[
   \text{Shaelyn's laps} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so:
   \[
   \text{Quinn's laps} = 7 - 2 = 5
   \]

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:
\[
\text{Difference} = 10 - 5 = 5
\]

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on the first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge, accounting for the different rates of charge loss.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank is at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).

   \[
   x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
   \]

   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]

   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).

   \[
   y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348
   \]

   \[
   y \times 0.624032 = 0.348
   \]

   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.557
   \]

   So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.7%.

**Final Answer:**
The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.7%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, making a total of $25 per hour. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 1000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Janet wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. Therefore, the amount she needs to save is:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000. Since she earns $1000 per week, the number of weeks required is:

\[ \frac{2000 \text{ dollars}}{1000 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased.

- The cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- The cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- The cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- The cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, let's determine the total number of sweets Anne has. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept two packs for herself. The number of pieces in these two packs is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Subtracting the pieces Anne kept from the total number of pieces gives the number of pieces left to be distributed among her friends:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne has 10 friends, and she wants to distribute the 780 pieces equally among them. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend receives is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each of her friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"

2. **Early checkouts**: 24 guests checked out early.
   - Guests after early checkouts: \(100 - 24 = 76\)

3. **Late checkouts**: 15 guests opted for a late checkout.
   - Guests after late checkouts: \(76 - 15 = 61\)

4. **Afternoon check-ins**: Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   - Number of people who checked in: \(2 \times 15 = 30\)
   - Guests after afternoon check-ins: \(61 + 30 = 91\)

5. **Additional check-ins after dinner**: 7 more people checked in.
   - Final number of guests: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

1. On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
3. On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we add the bananas picked each day:
\[4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22\]

So, the total number of bananas John has is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions: 60
   - Percentage of easy questions: 40%
     \[
     \text{Number of easy questions} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24
     \]
   - The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions:
     \[
     \text{Number of average and difficult questions} = 60 - 24 = 36
     \]
     Since these are equally divided:
     \[
     \text{Number of average questions} = \text{Number of difficult questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions:
     \[
     \text{Number of easy questions Aries gets correct} = 0.75 \times 24 = 18
     \]
   - Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correctly:
     \[
     \text{Number of average questions Aries gets correct} = \frac{18}{2} = 9

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, each small stuffed animal costs $4, so \( S = 4 \). Since a large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one, \( L = 3 \times S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \).

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) (since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{Number of small stuffed animals sold} \times \text{Price of a small stuffed animal}) + (\text{Number of large stuffed animals sold} \times \text{Price of a large stuffed animal}) \]
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is \( x = 6 \), and the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

The final numerical answer is:

3. **Eggs not found by the Smith twins**: Subtract the eggs found by the Smith twins from the total number of eggs: \(100 - 60 = 40\) eggs.
4. **Eggs found by friends**: According to the problem, all other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is \(40 - 10 = 30\).

Thus, the friends found \(\boxed{30}\) eggs."
"First, let's determine the amount of ore one dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe.

1. With a bare hands, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is:
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is:
   \[
   24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

Now, we need to calculate how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days.

4. One dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not have to turn in his homework and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50.
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Contribution to the probability of not having to turn in homework: \(0.50\).

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.50.
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40.
   - Combined probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension: \(0.50 \times 0.40 = 0.20\).
   - Contribution to the probability of not having to turn in homework: \(0.20\).

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets an Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.50.
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60.
   - Probability of Marcus getting an extension from the normal teacher: 20% or 0.20.
   - Combined probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting an extension: \(0.50 \times 0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.06\).
   - Contribution to the probability of not having to turn in homework: \(0.06\).

Now, we sum up all the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
\[0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76\]

The probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is the complement of the above probability:
\[1 - 0.76 = 0.24\]

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not reserved for graduates and faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 seats. After reserving 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, the number of seats available for guests is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we divide the number of available guest seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive \(\boxed{5}\) tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans and then use these relationships to find the number of small jelly beans he can consume.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150

   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - The number of intervals between bottles is \( \frac{24}{3} = 8 \).
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Determine the time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since there are 9 bottles, he will need to make 8 transitions (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the eighth to the ninth).
   - The total time is \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \(\boxed{40}\) seconds."
"First, calculate the total number of apples Uncle Franky has by multiplying the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, determine how many packs of apples he can make by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese that Amor buys. The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she buys 2 pounds:

\[ 11 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 2 \, \text{pounds} = 22 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the mozzarella cheese that Amor buys. The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she buys 3 pounds:

\[ 6 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 3 \, \text{pounds} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total amount spent:

\[ 22 \, \text{dollars} + 18 \, \text{dollars} = 40 \, \text{dollars} \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after her purchases, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount she started with:

\[ 50 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of loans:**
   Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   \[
   \text{Total loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working:**
   Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year. Since he did not work during his 4 years of college, the total income lost is:
   \[
   \text{Total income lost} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the income lost:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount to earn} = \text{Total loans} + \text{Total income lost} = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine Jim's new income after earning a college degree:**
   His income tripled, so his new income is:
   \[
   \text{New income} = 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000 \text{ dollars per year}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of years it will take to earn the total amount:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Total amount to earn}}{\text{New income}} = \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Jim \(\boxed{4}\) years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \] square feet."

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is \(\boxed{101}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average over the three races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5

2. **Second Race:**
   - Winnings: $1 more than twice the amount lost in the first race.
   - Calculation: \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\)
   - Winnings: $11

3. **Third Race:**
   - Loss: 1.5 times the amount won in the second race.
   - Calculation: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)
   - Loss: $16.5

Now, let's sum up the total amount lost and won:

- Total loss: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\)
- Total winnings: $11

Net loss: \(21.5 - 11 = 10.5\)

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net loss by the number of races:

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches since the final heights of both Cole and Xavier will be in inches.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Xavier's height as follows:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Convert the time worked per day into hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day.
   - Therefore, the number of hours worked per day is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days worked:**
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days worked is:
     \[
     3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each painter worked 9 hours per day.
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team per day is:

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

First, combine the terms involving \( x \):
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot (2x) + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved \( x = 6 \) balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and \( n = 3 \) years.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Calculate the value after the first year:
\[ 20000 \times (1 - 0.21) = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800 \]

2. Calculate the value after the second year:
\[ 15800 \times 0.79 = 12482 \]

3. Calculate the value after the third year:
\[ 12482 \times 0.79 = 9831.78 \]

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is \(\boxed{9831.78}\)."

"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the number of slices each person ate in terms of Jake's slices. Let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate.

According to the problem:
- Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate \( J + 3 \) slices.
- Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \( 2J \) slices.
- Becky ate 10 slices, so we can set up the equation \( J + 3 = 10 \).

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J + 3 = 10 \]
\[ J = 10 - 3 \]
\[ J = 7 \]

So, Jake ate 7 slices. Now we can find out how many slices Silvia ate:
\[ 2J = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now we know:
- Becky ate 10 slices.
- Jake ate 7 slices.
- Silvia ate 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we add the slices eaten by each person:
\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's time can be expressed as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the time spent by Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( D \). We do this by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part of the meal took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's time as:
\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Betsy's part took is \(\boxed{58}\)."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual charges:

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all tests and then divide by the number of tests.

1. Calculate the total score for the first 3 tests:
   \[
   100 + 100 + 100 = 300
   \]

2. Add the score of the 4th test:
   \[
   300 + 80 = 380
   \]

3. Divide the total score by the number of tests (which is 4) to find the average:
   \[
   \frac{380}{4} = 95
   \]

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left from their order.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left from their order.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he is sending out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of the small coupons and the cost of the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the number of meatballs in the initial order:**
   - Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - \(7 \text{ sub sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sub sandwich} = 28 \text{ meatballs}\).

3. **Determine how many meatballs Mark ate:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(4 \text{ sub sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sub sandwich} = 16 \text{ meatballs}\).

4. **Calculate the number of meatballs remaining after Mark ate:**
   - \(28 \text{ meatballs} - 16 \text{ meatballs} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

5. **Determine the number of additional sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - \(3 \text{ sub sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sub sandwich} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

6. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches:**
   - The remaining sub sandwiches are the initial 3 sub sandwiches minus the 4 that Mark ate, plus the 3 additional sub sandwiches.
   - \(3 \text{ sub sandwiches} - 4 \text{ sub sandwiches} + 3 \text{ sub sandwiches} = 2 \text{ sub sandwiches}\).
   - \(2 \text{ sub sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sub sandwich} = 8 \text{ meatballs}\).

Therefore, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, we need to determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver their loads. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is:
     \[
     4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   Since each set of 1.5 pounds costs $6.00, the total cost for 4 sets is:
   \[
   4 \times 6.00 = 24.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{24.00}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who said they could not come. Therefore, the number of guests who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests. For each additional guest beyond the first 20, the cost is $6. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for these additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the base rental fee to the cost of the additional guests gives us the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"Let's start by determining how much money Maggie and Riza each originally had.

First, we know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left. Let \( M \) be the amount of money Maggie originally had. Since she spent a quarter of her money, she has three-quarters of her money left. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{4}M = 60
\]
To find \( M \), we solve for \( M \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[
M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]
So, Maggie originally had $80. After spending a quarter, she has $60 left.

Next, we know that Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left. Let \( R \) be the amount of money Riza originally had. Since she spent one-third of her money, she has two-thirds of her money left. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{3}R = 60
\]
To find \( R \), we solve for \( R \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[
R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]
So, Riza originally had $90. After spending one-third, she has $60 left.

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:
\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]
Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in one day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas} \]

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas to last a week (7 days), the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in one day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, we find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day by subtracting the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in one day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle and then finished another entire 500 piece puzzle.

Half of a 500 piece puzzle is:
\[ \frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Teddy placed 250 pieces from the first puzzle and all 500 pieces from the second puzzle.

The total number of pieces Teddy placed during that hour is:
\[ 250 + 500 = 750 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has. She arrived with five $5 bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to buy the roses. Therefore, she cannot complete the purchase and will not receive any change.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of item sold and then sum these amounts.

1. **Milkshakes:**
   - Number of milkshakes sold: 6
   - Price per milkshake: $5.50
   - Total revenue from milkshakes: \( 6 \times 5.50 = 33 \) dollars

2. **Burger platters:**
   - Number of burger platters sold: 9
   - Price per burger platter: $11
   - Total revenue from burger platters: \( 9 \times 11 = 99 \) dollars

3. **Sodas:**
   - Number of sodas sold: 20
   - Price per soda: $1.50
   - Total revenue from sodas: \( 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \) dollars

Now, we sum the revenues from all items:
\[ 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Terry makes is \(\boxed{162}\) dollars."
"Let's break down the timeline step by step to determine how long Paul will wait for his train.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves after 30 minutes (10 minutes to arrive + 20 minutes to stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after the first train arrives, which is 40 minutes from the start).
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) minutes.
   - Leaves after 45 minutes (40 minutes to arrive + 5 minutes to stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (60 minutes after the second train arrives, which is 105 minutes from the start).
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 105 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (20 minutes after the third train arrives, which is 125 minutes from the start).
   - This is the train Paul will board.

Paul arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes) and the fourth train arrives at 125 minutes. Therefore, Paul will wait for 125 minutes.

**Final Answer:**
125 minutes"
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already collected. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total required:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was originally priced at $2000 and was sold to Mr. Rogers at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch. The original price of the watch was $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800.

The discount amount is:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
   - In 4 hours, there are \(4 \times 3600 = 14400\) seconds.

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create \(14400\) jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\) jellyfish.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is \(\boxed{72000}\)."
"To determine Frankie's score, we start by defining the relationship between Frankie's score and Binkie's score based on the information given.

Let \( B \) represent Binkie's score, and \( F \) represent Frankie's score. According to the problem, Binkie's score is 90, so we have:
\[ B = 90 \]

The problem states that Frankie's score was 15 more than twice Binkie's score. This can be expressed with the equation:
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2(90) + 15 \]

Now, perform the multiplication and addition:
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

Thus, Frankie's score is:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"
"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to consider the total distance he walked and his walking speed.

1. The distance from James's home to the store is 4 miles.
2. James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
3. He then had to walk back home, covering another 2 miles.
4. Therefore, the total distance James walked is \(2 + 2 = 4\) miles.
5. James's walking speed is 4 miles per hour.

To find the time it took James to walk 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the time it took James to reach the store (considering the round trip back home) is 1 hour. However, the question specifically asks for the time it took him to reach the store, which is the time for the initial 2 miles he walked before turning back. 

For the initial 2 miles:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time it took James to reach the store is 0.5 hours, or 30 minutes.

0.5 hours"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the annual growth rate is:

\[ \text{Annual growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total growth over 13 years by multiplying the annual growth rate by 13:

\[ \text{Total growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Trekking bikes: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150 \)
   - BMX bikes: \( 15\% \times 300 = 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
   - MTB bikes: \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \)

2. **Determine the price of each type of bike:**
   - MTB: $500
   - BMX: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 500 = 250 \)
   - Trekking: $450

3. **Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Earnings from MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \)
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)

4. **Sum the earnings from all types of bikes:**
   \[
   52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250
   \]

Therefore, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the net number of bales added to or removed from the field each hour and then extend that over the 6-hour workday.

1. **Bales produced by the farmer per hour:** 5 bales
2. **Bales picked up by the truck per hour:** 3 bales

The net number of bales added to the field each hour is:
\[ 5 \text{ bales} - 3 \text{ bales} = 2 \text{ bales} \]

Over a 6-hour workday, the total number of bales added to the field is:
\[ 2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

Since the question does not specify the initial number of bales in the field, we assume the field starts with 0 bales. Therefore, after 6 hours, the number of bales left in the field is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

This is the time spent in classes from Monday to Friday. Now, let's calculate the time spent on extra learning on Saturday and Sunday.

He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each of these days.

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 320 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time:

\[ 320 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, John spends 6 hours a week learning."
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial drop height is:
   \[
   3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
   \[
   72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
   \[
   48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."
"Let's break down the heights step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child's height in inches is:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
   \[
   72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:
   \[
   69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is \(\boxed{72}\) inches."
"To determine how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bags sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples per bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\]

So, the cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"Let's break down the scenario step by step to determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 of them.
   - She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas.
   - There are now 2 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

2. **Brother's Action:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas.
   - After his action, the remaining sodas are:
     - Shaken sodas: \(3 - 1 = 2\)
     - Unshaken sodas: \(2 - 2 = 0\)

3. **Final Setup:**
   - There are 2 shaken sodas left.
   - There are no unshaken sodas left.

4. **Friend's Action:**
   - Ellen's friend comes along and takes 1 soda.
   - Since there are no unshaken sodas left, the friend can only take a shaken soda.

5. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The friend will definitely take a shaken soda because there are no unshaken sodas left.
   - The probability that the friend gets a shaken soda is 100%.

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:

\[
\boxed{100\%}

"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:
- Distance traveled by the first train: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled by the second train: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

The total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the two trains are \(\boxed{270}\) miles apart after 3 hours."
"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

"To determine how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry, which would be the maximum number of people that could have attended the ceremony.

First, we calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses, and each bus carried 35 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people that the buses could carry is \(12 \times 35 = 420\).

Next, we calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars, and each car carried 3 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people that the cars could carry is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

Adding the number of people that the buses and cars could carry gives us the total number of people that could have been at the ceremony:
- The total number of people is \(420 + 60 = 480\).

Thus, the maximum number of people that were inside the church is \(\boxed{480}\)."
"To determine Jeff's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

   \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, Jeff is \(\boxed{30}\) years old."
"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to ride the biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to ride the second biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{second biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second biggest}}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
- He also takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which totals \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes.

So, the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 30 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, the daily total is 1 hour.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunches and breaks is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."
"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran \(\boxed{16}\) miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Charge:**
   Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card.

2. **Return of Item:**
   She returned an item that cost $15.00. This reduces her balance.
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **New Purchase:**
   Sheila bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   Subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

4. **Second New Purchase:**
   She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   Subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]

5. **Total New Purchases:**
   Add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels:
   \[
   16.00 + 27.00 = 43.00
   \]

6. **Final Balance:**
   Add the total new purchases to the remaining balance after the return:

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{J}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement income needed:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement income} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live for 20 years in retirement.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount Lauren saves each year:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of years needed to save the total retirement amount:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \text{ years}

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement."
"First, we need to determine the length of each of the 4 equal parts of the ribbon. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon, and he needs to cut it into 4 equal parts. So, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]

Each of these 4 parts is 25 centimeters long. Next, each of these 25-centimeter parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. So, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total population of the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school by \( P \).

Given that 40% of \( P \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total height of all the heels:
- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
- Therefore, the total height of all the heels is \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

Next, we need to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"First, let's determine the time each person spent on their chores:

1. **Amalia's time**: Amalia spent 4 hours mowing the lawn.
2. **Megan's time**: Megan's chore was to walk the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan spent \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours walking the dog.
3. **Dior's time**: Dior's chore was to do laundry, which took her more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's 4 hours. Therefore, Dior spent \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours doing laundry (since ""over 4 hours longer"" can be interpreted as at least 5 hours, but the smallest integer over 4 is 5, and to ensure it's ""well over,"" we can use 9 as a clear example).

Now, we sum up the time spent by each person:
\[ 4 \text{ (Amalia)} + 6 \text{ (Megan)} + 9 \text{ (Dior)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\)."

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers and then find out how many toys are still needed to meet the order, which will help us find the production rate of the fifth worker.

First, let's calculate the total production of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- They work for 10 hours.
- Therefore, each of these two workers produces \(6 \times 10 = 60\) toys.
- Together, they produce \(60 \times 2 = 120\) toys.

Next, let's calculate the total production of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- They work for 10 hours.
- Therefore, each of these two workers produces \(4 \times 10 = 40\) toys.
- Together, they produce \(40 \times 2 = 80\) toys.

Now, let's find the total production of the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 120 toys.
- The next two workers produce 80 toys.
- Together, they produce \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the first four workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

The fifth worker works for 10 hours, so the production rate of the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Therefore, the number of toys per hour the fifth worker produces is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

"Let's work through the problem step by step, starting from the end and moving backwards.

1. **Rob received 7 stickers from Kris.** Before giving these 7 stickers to Rob, Kris had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers (since Kris kept 9 and gave the rest to Rob).

2. **Kris received 16 stickers from Luis.** Since Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.

3. **Luis received 32 stickers from Seth.** Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Thus, Seth had \(\boxed{64}\) stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

\[ 3 \text{ large bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per large bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we determine the total number of M&M he has by multiplying the total weight by the number of M&M per ounce:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M} \]

Now, we need to find out how many small bags he can fill if each small bag contains 10 M&M:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M}}{10 \text{ M&M per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance that is half of the way around the earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance given his daily flying distance.

First, the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of the way around the earth is:
\[
\frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
\]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by his daily flying distance:
\[
\frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
\]

Therefore, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**
   - The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
   - The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine the speed of the fastest car:**
   - The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is \(\boxed{750}\) miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \( A \), by Madeline as \( M \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know \( A = 13 \), \( M = 13 \), \( C = 21 \), and \( S = 9 \). The problem asks how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the length of the usable part of the tree:**
   - The tree is 80 feet tall.
   - John can make logs out of 80% of it.
   - Usable length = \( 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \) feet.

2. **Calculate the number of 4-foot logs:**
   - Each log is 4 feet long.
   - Number of logs = \( \frac{64}{4} = 16 \) logs.

3. **Calculate the number of planks from each log:**
   - From each log, he cuts 5 planks.
   - Total number of planks = \( 16 \times 5 = 80 \) planks.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from selling the planks:**
   - Each plank is sold for $1.2.
   - Total earnings = \( 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \) dollars.

Therefore, John makes \(\boxed{96}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000 and her brother earns $10000, so together they earn:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we find the total amount of money they all have together by adding Valerie's salary, her brother's salary, and their mother's salary:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Thus, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the distances and speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

We know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and the distance she covers on the beach is 2 miles. Using the formula for speed, \( \text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} \), we can find \( v \):

\[
v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find the time she spends walking on the sidewalk. The distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile, and her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \) miles per minute. Using the speed formula again, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk:

\[
\text{total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She saves $4 every week and has been saving for 8 weeks.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal.

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the amount she needs by the amount she saves per week.

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

\[ \boxed{7} \]"

"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Bob originally has:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to solve for the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Next, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. We subtract 10 from the original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is at a temperature that allows Donny to drink it, which means the temperature must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's calculate the temperature of the mixture in the water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug). The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as a weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs of water:

\[
\text{Temperature of the mixture} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5}
\]

We know that this temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, simplify the left side of the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Next, multiply both sides by 5 to clear the denominator:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Then, subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"

1. **Initial number of animals:**
   - Cows: 50
   - Chickens: 20

2. **Number of days in three weeks:**
   - 3 weeks = 3 × 7 = 21 days

3. **Cows added per day:**
   - 20 cows/day

4. **Total cows added in 21 days:**
   - 20 cows/day × 21 days = 420 cows

5. **Total cows after three weeks:**
   - Initial cows + Cows added = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

6. **Chickens added per day:**
   - 10 chickens/day

7. **Total chickens added in 21 days:**
   - 10 chickens/day × 21 days = 210 chickens

8. **Total chickens after three weeks:**
   - Initial chickens + Chickens added = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

9. **Total number of animals after three weeks:**
   - Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals

**Final answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the cost is:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the total cost. So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:

\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
   \]

2. **Find out how many scoops make up 1 scoop of mashed potatoes:**
   It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes for 2 scoops}
   \]
   Therefore, for 1 scoop:
   \[
   \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = 1.5 \text{ potatoes per scoop}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 18 scoops, and each scoop requires 1.5 potatoes.
   \[
   18 \text{ scoops} \times 1.5 \text{ potatoes per scoop} = 27 \text{ potatoes}

"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs for 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"First, let's determine the number of red jellybeans. According to the problem, there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans. Since there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is:

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects from one tree in one year.
2. Calculate the total number of lemons from all trees in one year.
3. Calculate the total number of lemons from all trees over a decade (10 years).

Step 1: Lemons from one tree in one year
Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree each year.

Step 2: Total lemons from all trees in one year
Tim grows 5 trees, so the total number of lemons from all trees in one year is:
\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Step 3: Total lemons from all trees over a decade
A decade is 10 years, so the total number of lemons over 10 years is:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially based on the given ratio and total number of passengers.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 9 = 14\).

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the total number of passengers by the total parts of the ratio:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6
\]

Next, we calculate the number of men and women:
\[
\text{Number of men} = 5 \times 6 = 30
\]
\[
\text{Number of women} = 9 \times 6 = 54
\]

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To determine the probability that both of Mark's lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\) or 60%.

2. **Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners:**
   - The probability of both independent events happening (both tickets winning) is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the combined probability is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the combined probability to a percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, multiply by 100.

"To determine how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to break down his consumption by days of the week.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - Mason eats 4 carrots each day.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Total carrots on weekdays = \( 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \).

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Mason eats 5 carrots each day.
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - Total carrots on weekends = \( 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \).

3. **Total carrots in a week:**
   - Total carrots = Carrots on weekdays + Carrots on weekends
   - Total carrots = \( 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \).

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"To determine the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the duration of each song and then sum them up.

1. The first song is 5 minutes long.
2. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the duration of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

First, calculate 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add this to the original duration of the first song to get the duration of the second song:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, add the durations of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's determine the selling price of one mobile device. Linus buys each device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price. Therefore, the selling price of one device is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one device. The profit per device is the selling price minus the buying price:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices he bought is:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

Since he makes a profit of $20 per device, the total profit from selling all 6 devices is:

\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Ned's height:**
   - Isabel is 7 feet tall.
   - Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - So, he sells 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells a quarter of the remaining land for $30.
   - A quarter of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - So, he sells 10 square meters for $30.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money from the final sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - The total money earned from all sales is the sum of the money from each sale.
   - Total earnings = $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $90 (from the final sale) = $170.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Face masks used per outing:**
   Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.

2. **Number of outings per day:**
   Tyrion goes out three times a day.

3. **Face masks used per day:**
   Since he changes his mask twice per outing and goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ masks/outing} \times 3 \text{ outings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]

4. **Face masks used in 2 days:**
   To find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks used per day by 2:
   \[

Therefore, Tyrion uses \(\boxed{12}\) face masks every 2 days."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total eggs hidden by Cole**: Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

2. **Eggs found by Lamar**: Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. **Eggs found by Stacy**: Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar. So, Stacy finds \(2 \times 5 = 10\) eggs.

4. **Eggs found by Charlie**: Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy. So, Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

5. **Eggs found by Mei**: Mei finds half as many as Charlie. So, Mei finds \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by all the children:
- Lamar: 5 eggs
- Stacy: 10 eggs
- Charlie: 8 eggs
- Mei: 4 eggs

The total number of eggs found is \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
\[36 - 27 = 9\]

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so combined they have:

\[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from:

\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections}\]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars}\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[\boxed{1248}\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree over its first 10 years of life.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 3 \times 50 = 150 \) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 7 \times 50 = 350 \) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - Let the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree be \( x \).
   - Therefore, the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree is \( x - 200 \).

5. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 20 \times 50 = 1000 \) fruits.
   - So, \( x = 1000 \).

6. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) fruits.

7. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Does not produce any fruits.
   - \( 0 \) fruits.

8. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 1000 fruits.

Now, let's sum up the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
\]

Adding these together:

\[
50 + 150 = 200
\]
\[
200 + 350 = 550
\]
\[
550 + 800 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 0 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 1000 = 2350

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope in centimeters.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope in centimeters.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope in centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R = 4B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Next, substitute \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ B = 12 - 7 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Finally, we can find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B \]
\[ R = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Since Ronnie also gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, he also gave $3. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used first. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:

\[
\frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
\]

This leaves the other half of the mural to be painted with red, white, and purple paint. Since the remaining half is also 6 pints and the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can denote the amount of each of these colors as \(x\). Therefore, we have:

\[
x + x + x = 6
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x = 6
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{6}{3} = 2
\]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs counted each day:
\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods. Therefore, the number of pods in the special size box is:

\[ 100 + 0.20 \times 100 = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per pod in the special size box. The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. So, the cost per pod is:

\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the cost per cycle is $0.10. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per cycle:

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before he has to recycle it, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk = 5 inches - (45% of 5 inches) = 5 inches - (0.45 * 5 inches) = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage:**
   - The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day.
   - Daily usage = 20% of the remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the number of days before the chalk is recycled:**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the remaining chalk to fall below 2 inches.

Let's denote the remaining chalk after \( n \) days as \( C_n \).

- Initial remaining chalk \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches.
- Daily usage is 20% of the remaining chalk, so the remaining chalk after each day is 80% of the previous day's remaining chalk.

The formula for the remaining chalk after \( n \) days is:
\[ C_n = 2.75 \times (0.8)^n \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( C_n < 2 \) inches.

\[ 2.75 \times (0.8)^n < 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2.75:
\[ (0.8)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} \]
\[ (0.8)^n < \frac{8}{11} \]

To solve for \( n \), we take the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[ \ln((0.8)^n) < \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \]
\[ n \ln(0.8) < \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \]

Since \(\ln(0.8)\) is negative, we divide both sides by \(\ln(0.8)\) and reverse the inequality:
\[ n > \frac{\ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)}{\ln(0.8)} \]

Calculate the values:
\[ \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \approx -0.3365 \]
\[ \ln(0.8) \approx -0.2231 \]
\[ n > \frac{-0.3365}{-0.2231} \approx 1.507 \]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:
\[ n = 2 \]

Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 more days before it falls below 2 inches.

**Final Answer:**
The teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"First, let's determine the number of girls on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of boys on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys}
\]

Now, we find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:

\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students}
\]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class. The total number of students is:

\[
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ students}
\]

Thus, the number of students not on varsity is:

\[
24 - 7 = 17 \text{ students}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

2. **Determine the number of teeth the dentist drills:**
   \[
   \text{Teeth drilled} = 4
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of teeth the dentist caps:**
   \[
   \text{Teeth capped} = \text{Teeth drilled} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11
   \]

4. **Find the total number of teeth fixed (drilled and capped):**
   \[
   \text{Total teeth fixed} = \text{Teeth drilled} + \text{Teeth capped} = 4 + 11 = 15
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Total teeth fixed}}{\text{Total teeth}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:
\[
\boxed{50\%}

"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount had passed the expiry date.

The amount of milk that passed the expiry date is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Since the company sold the milk at $3.5 per gallon, the refund amount for the 1600 gallons of returned milk is:
\[
1600 \times 3.5 = 1600 \times \frac{35}{10} = \frac{1600 \times 35}{10} = \frac{56000}{10} = 5600
\]

Therefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:
\[
\boxed{5600}
\]"
"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin using variables. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

**Step 1: Translate the first piece of information into an equation.**

Colin's age in seven years is \( C + 7 \). According to the problem, Wendy's current age \( W \) is five times this value:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

**Step 2: Translate the second piece of information into an equation.**

In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \). According to the problem, this age is a third of Wendy's current age \( W \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

**Step 3: Solve the system of equations.**

First, we have:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:**
   - Bob can buy 100 books for $500.
   - To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000, we divide $27000 by $500:
     \[
     \frac{27000}{500} = 54
     \]
   - Therefore, Bob can buy \(54 \times 100 = 5400\) books in total.

2. **Determine the number of books per school:**
   - Bob distributes the $27000 equally among 3 schools.
   - To find out how much money is spent per school, we divide $27000 by 3:
     \[
     \frac{27000}{3} = 9000
     \]
   - With $9000 per school, we calculate how many books can be bought:
     \[
     \frac{9000}{500} = 18
     \]
   - Therefore, each school can buy \(18 \times 100 = 1800\) books.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1800}

"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picked up the two apples.

2. **First Action:**
   - Newton put one apple in his pocket.
   - Newton threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up these 5 apples.
   - Newton put all but one of these 5 apples in his pocket.
   - Newton threw the remaining one apple at the tree.

3. **Second Action:**
   - Newton picked up all of the remaining apples (which were 4, since he put 4 in his pocket and threw 1 at the tree).
   - Newton went home to make a pie.

Now, let's count the apples Newton brought home:

- Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples.
- After the first action, he put 4 apples in his pocket (1 from the initial 2 apples and 3 from the 5 that fell).
- After the second action, he picked up 4 more apples and put them in his pocket.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is the 1 apple he kept after throwing the 5 apples and the 4 apples he picked up after the second action.

Therefore, the total number of apples Newton brought home is:
\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed to deliver 850 kg of coal.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

First, we calculate the number of 50 kg bags required:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the order:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required to provide these slices.

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the miles run on the days Sam ran 3 miles:
- Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
- This totals to \(3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}\).

Next, let's calculate the miles run on the days Sam ran 5 miles:
- Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday.
- This totals to \(5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}\).

Now, we add the miles run on the days with 3 miles to the miles run on the days with 5 miles:
- Total miles = \(9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}\).

Therefore, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's calculate the net rate of snowball production. Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many snowballs melt in an hour. There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 2 \text{ snowballs/15 minutes} \times 4 = 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

This means that for every hour, Jay effectively gains:

\[ 20 \text{ snowballs/hour} - 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can set up the equation:

\[ 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \times t \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ snowballs} \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ t = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay \(\boxed{5}\) hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary:**
   - Since the question does not specify the current year, we can assume that the current year is the year of Digimon's 20th anniversary. Therefore, the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary is 20 years.

2. **Calculate John's age 20 years ago:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age 20 years ago:**
   - According to the problem, 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - Let \(x\) be Jim's age 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, \(8 = 2x\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = \frac{8}{2} = 4\).

4. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, Jim's current age is \(4 + 20 = 24\).

The final numerical answer is:

"Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, which means her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, which means her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:

1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

So, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered enough to cover the deficit and have some left over. So, they ordered \(28 - 12 = 16\) more bandages to cover the deficit and have 50 - 16 = 34 bandages at the end of the second day.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = 2 * 50 = 100
   - Bandages used: \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\)

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information. Let's re-evaluate the bandages at the end of the second day correctly:

- Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\), so they ordered 28 more bandages to cover the deficit, making it \(12 - 28 + 28 = 12\).

Now, for the third day:
- Bandages ordered: 2 * 50 = 100
- Bandages used: 25
- Bandages at the end of the third day: \(12 + 100 - 25 = 87\)

Since the problem states they had 78 bandages left, we need to adjust the initial number of bandages they started with on the first day. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \(x\).

- After the first day: \(x + 50 - 38 = x + 12\)
- After the second day: \(x + 12 - 28 + 28 = x + 12\)
- After the third day: \(x + 12 + 100 - 25 = x + 87\)

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages, so:
\[x + 87 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 87\]
\[x = -9\]

Since the initial number of bandages can't be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints and ensure the correct interpretation. The correct interpretation should be that they started with 9 bandages initially, and the calculations should be rechecked for any misinterpretation. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"To determine the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to break down the expenses:

1. **Cost of the color**: The cost for the color is a flat rate of $40.
2. **Cost of the haircut**: The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means the hair was cut by 2 inches. Therefore, the cost for the haircut is \(2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60\).

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ \$40 + \$60 = \$100 \]

So, the total cost of May's cut and color is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"First, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings from her hourly rate:

- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total earnings from her hourly rate for April are:
\[ \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$270 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she also receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To determine how much money Jason earned over the two-week period, we need to calculate the earnings from each task and then sum them up.

1. **Emptying the dishwasher**: Jason earns $0.50 each time he empties the dishwasher. He did this 6 times.
   \[
   6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
   \]

2. **Doing his laundry**: Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry once.
   \[
   1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
   \]

3. **Cleaning his room**: Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room once.
   \[
   1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Taking the trash to the curb**: Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb each week. He did this twice.
   \[
   2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
   \]

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[
3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jason earned is:
\[
\boxed{9.00}

"First, we need to determine the amount of blood a single shark has. According to the information provided, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood a shark has as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have in total. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by 10:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (at 10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
\]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red pens.
2. Calculate the number of black pens.
3. Add the number of red pens and black pens together.

First, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we know that the number of black pens is twice the number of red pens. Therefore, the total number of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens together to find the total number of pens:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Thus, the total number of pens Alain has is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[
\text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[
\text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day Planting:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. This means he planted \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Total White Oak trees planted over the two days: \(20 + 30 = 50\).
   - Total Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days: \(40 + 50 = 90\).
   - Therefore, the total number of trees planted is \(50 + 90 = 140\).

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \( \boxed{8} \)."
"First, let's determine how many fish have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, 22 fish have red stripes. Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes. To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is:

\[
\boxed{42}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy has two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors.
     \[
     2 \text{ palettes} \times 4 \text{ colors per palette} = 8 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Amy has three makeup sets, each with 6 colors.
     \[
     3 \text{ sets} \times 6 \text{ colors per set} = 18 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Total initial eyeshadow colors:
     \[
     8 \text{ colors from palettes} + 18 \text{ colors from sets} = 26 \text{ colors}
     \]

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette is stolen, which had 4 colors.
     \[
     26 \text{ colors} - 4 \text{ colors} = 22 \text{ colors}

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors, and Amy uses up half of them.
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ colors}}{2} = 3 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - After using up 3 colors from one set, the remaining colors from that set are:
     \[
     6 \text{ colors} - 3 \text{ colors} = 3 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - The total number of colors from the remaining two sets and the reduced set is:
     \[
     15 \text{ colors from the remaining two sets} + 3 \text{ colors from the reduced set} = 18 \text{ colors}

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is.
3. The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as he is.

We need to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.

**Step 1: Calculate the height of the house.**
The house is 7 times Mattison's height:
\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the height of the first floor.**
The first floor's ceiling height is 3 times Mattison's height:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the height of the second floor.**
The total height of the house is 420 inches, and the first floor is 180 inches high. Therefore, the height from the first floor to the second floor (which is the same as the height of the second floor) is:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.**
The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the second floor, which we calculated to be 240 inches.

Thus, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their share:

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by The finders from the remaining shells after Alphas:

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 420 - 252 = 168 \]

So, team Gogetters found:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's denote the miles the last dog needs to walk as \( x \).

We know the following:
- The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
- The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
- The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.
- The average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles.

The formula for the average is the total miles walked divided by the number of dogs. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[
\frac{1 + 4 + 3 + x}{4} = 3
\]

To find \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to clear the denominator:

\[
1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12
\]

Next, we simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
8 + x = 12
\]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:

\[
x = 4
\]

So, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by mortgaging his home. The house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that value.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of this loan amount John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we calculate the leftover amount after paying off the debts.

\[ \text{Leftover amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is:

\[ \boxed{40000} \]"

\[ 128 \text{ kilograms} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/kilogram} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

To perform the multiplication:

\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

   - The total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the first and second medicines.
   - Therefore, the total amount of medicine in one dose is \( 14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} \).

\[
14 + 42 = 56 \text{ mL}
\]

3. **Calculate the total amount of medicine in 8 doses:**
   - The total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 8 times the amount of medicine in one dose.
   - Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is \( 8 \times 56 \text{ mL} \).

"To determine the number of novels Regina has written this year, we start by letting \( x \) represent the number of novels she has written this year. According to the problem, the number of novels she wrote last year, which is 9, is equal to three-quarters of the number of novels she has written this year. This relationship can be expressed with the equation:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of novels Regina has written this year is:

\[ x = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of pieces of popcorn that Garrett has to eat.

1. **Initial Popping Rate:**
   - In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.

2. **Second 30 Seconds:**
   - The popping rate triples the initial rate.
   - Popping rate = \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels.

3. **Third 30 Seconds:**
   - The popping rate quadruples the initial rate.
   - Popping rate = \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.

4. **Fourth 30 Seconds:**
   - The popping rate is half of the third 30 seconds.
   - Popping rate = \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels.

5. **Final 30 Seconds:**
   - The popping rate is the same as the fourth 30 seconds, which is 40 kernels.

6. **Residual Heat Popping:**
   - A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat.
   - Kernels popping from residual heat = \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) kernels.

Now, let's sum up all the kernels that popped:

- First 30 seconds: 20 kernels
- Second 30 seconds: 60 kernels
- Third 30 seconds: 80 kernels
- Fourth 30 seconds: 40 kernels
- Final 30 seconds: 40 kernels
- Residual heat: 10 kernels

Total number of popped kernels:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 40 + 10 = 250 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:

**Step 3: Total revenue from selling the bars produced in two weeks**
The company sells each bar for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{140000} \]"
"Let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of T-shirts:**
   - The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
   - Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal.
   - The first T-shirt costs $8.
   - The second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs $8 * 0.5 = $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

2. **Cost of shoes:**
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - The shoes are 40% off, so Jake pays 60% of the original price.
   - The cost of the shoes is $40 * 0.6 = $24.

3. **Total amount spent:**
   - The total amount Jake spends is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes.
   - Total amount = $12 + $24 = $36.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has after 3 weeks of completing his chores. Since he gets $6 each week, we can calculate his total allowance as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dollars/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Ryan spends on ice cream cones. He buys ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which means he buys 4 ice cream cones in total. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for the ice cream cones is:

\[ 4 \text{ cones} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/cone} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream cones from his total allowance, we find out how much money Ryan has left:

\[ 18 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{13 \text{ dollars}}{6.50 \text{ dollars/ticket}} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2 \right\rfloor = 2 \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy \(\boxed{2}\) movie tickets."
"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in all, we need to calculate the total amount each of them spent and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate how much Ellen spent:
- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.
- Ellen also bought a photo frame for $5.
So, the total amount Ellen spent is:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Lani spent:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100. Therefore, the cost for the two bathrobes is:
\[ 100 \times 2 = 200 \]
So, the total amount Lani spent is:
\[ 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, we add the amounts spent by Ellen and Lani to find the total amount spent by both:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

Therefore, the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani is:
\[ \boxed{335} \]"
"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the total cost of ingredients for one jar and then for 10 jars, and subtract this from the total revenue from selling 10 jars.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = \(1.5 \times 8 = 12\) dollars
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars

Adding these together gives the total cost for one jar:
\[12 + 12 + 20 = 44 \text{ dollars}\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
\[44 \times 10 = 440 \text{ dollars}\]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:
\[50 \times 10 = 500 \text{ dollars}\]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[500 - 440 = 60 \text{ dollars}\]

Thus, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters:**

   - Justin has 32 quarters.
   - Value of quarters = \( 32 \times 0.25 = 8 \) dollars.

2. **Dimes:**
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Justin has 95 dimes.
   - Value of dimes = \( 95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \) dollars.

3. **Nickels:**
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Justin has 120 nickels.
   - Value of nickels = \( 120 \times 0.05 = 6 \) dollars.

4. **Pennies:**
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Justin has 750 pennies.
   - Value of pennies = \( 750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \) dollars.

Now, we sum the values of all the coins:
\[ 8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \]

The total dollar amount in the jar is \(\boxed{31}\)."

First, let's calculate the total amount spent:
1. Ice cream: $3.50
2. Movie tickets (for herself and her sister): $7.50 each, so $7.50 × 2 = $15.00
3. Bracelet: $8.50

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

So, Janet spent a total of $27.00.

Next, we subtract the total amount spent from the $40 her parents gave her:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

Therefore, Janet has \(\boxed{13}\) dollars left."

"Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for half of the collection and $7 per toy for the other half.

First, we calculate the number of toys in each half:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, 6 toys will be sold at $5 each, and the other 6 toys will be sold at $7 each.

Next, we calculate the earnings from the first half:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Then, we calculate the earnings from the second half:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount of money Matthew would earn:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

Therefore, if Matthew agrees to the offer, he would earn:

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes net reduction/day} \]

We need to determine how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a net rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's running speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's running speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - If Aaron's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \), then Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \).
   - To run 4 miles, the time taken is \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 4 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes} \).

"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total required.

First, since the caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, for 200 feet of dock, he needs:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, he already has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy \(\boxed{594}\) feet of line."

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
\[
20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
\]

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of mechanic's labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ c + k = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."

Next, we need to determine how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
