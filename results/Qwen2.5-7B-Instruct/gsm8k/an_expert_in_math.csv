"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Janet has each day, which is 16 eggs.

Next, we account for the eggs Janet uses:
- She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
- She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used each day is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we find out how many eggs are left to sell:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}

"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we start by identifying the amount of each type of fiber required.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

Next, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts needed:
\[
2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
\]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs:**
   - Cost of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total cost: \( 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \)

2. **Determine the new value of the house after repairs:**
   - The value of the house increased by 150%.
   - A 150% increase means the value is multiplied by 2.5 (since 150% = 1.5, and the original value is 1, so 1 + 1.5 = 2.5).
   - Original value of the house: $80,000
   - New value: \( 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \)

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost.
   - New value of the house: $200,000
   - Total cost: $130,000
   - Profit: \( 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \)

Thus, Josh's profit is \(\boxed{70000}\)."
"To determine the total number of meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total distance James runs in one session.
2. Multiply that by the number of sessions he has in a week.

First, we know that James runs 3 sprints in each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the distance he runs in one session is:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, we know that James runs 3 times a week. So, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of meters James runs in a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day. Since each chicken is given 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken consumes:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Given that Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement for all the chickens is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and the afternoon:

- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the first glass} = \$5 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the second glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the second glass} = 0.60 \times \$5 = \$3 \]

This pattern continues, with every first glass costing $5 and every second glass costing $3. Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can break this down into 8 pairs of glasses.

The cost for one pair (one $5 glass and one $3 glass) is:
\[ \$5 + \$3 = \$8 \]

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times \$8 = \$64 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we start by defining the number of sheep each city has in terms of the number of sheep Seattle has.

1. Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep Seattle has. According to the problem, \( S = 20 \).

2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, the number of sheep Charleston has is:
   \[
   C = 4 \times S = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, the number of sheep Toulouse has is:
   \[
   T = 2 \times C = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. To find the total number of sheep, we sum the sheep from Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
   \[
   T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together is \(\boxed{260}\)."
"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into several steps and calculate the time for each step.

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.4 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Add the time for the Windows update restart:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.6 \times 200 = 120 \text{ GB}\).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Sum up all the times:**
   - Time to download the first 80 GB: 40 minutes.
   - Time for the Windows update restart: 20 minutes.
   - Time to download the remaining 120 GB: 60 minutes.
   - Total time: \(40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \text{ minutes}\).

Thus, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then subtract the distance he has covered from the initial distance to his home.

1. **Initial Distance to Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = \(60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}\).

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John drives for 4 hours in total to return home.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = \(30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}\).
   - The remaining time is \(4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}\).
   - He drives the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = \(80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}\).

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Journey:**
   - Total distance = Distance covered in standstill + Distance covered at 30 mph + Distance covered at 80 mph
   - Total distance = \(0 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles}\).

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance to home = 180 miles.
   - Distance covered on the return journey = 135 miles.
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance covered = \(180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles}\).

Thus, John is \(\boxed{45}\) miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her pay for both her regular hours and her overtime hours separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the pay for regular hours:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She worked 40 regular hours.
   - Regular pay = \( 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \).

2. **Calculate the pay for overtime hours:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so the number of overtime hours is \( 45 - 40 = 5 \text{ hours} \).
   - Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
   - Overtime pay rate = \( 1.2 \times \$10 = \$12/\text{hour} \).
   - Overtime pay = \( 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \).

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay
   - Total earnings = \( \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \).

Thus, Eliza's earnings for this week are \(\boxed{460}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Month:**
   The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month's downloads.
   \[
   \text{Third month downloads} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month.
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is \(\boxed{366}\)."
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry separately and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen donuts is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times 68 \).

2. **Cost of Mini Cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen mini cupcakes is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \( 2 \times 80 \).

   \[
   6 \times 55 = 330
   \]

Finally, we sum these amounts to get the total cost:

\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

Thus, the total cost is \(\boxed{694}\)."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost:**
   - The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.

2. **Annual Costs:**
   - The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

3. **Annual Revenue:**
   - Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons.
   - Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
   - Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

4. **Net Annual Profit:**
   - The net annual profit is the annual revenue minus the annual cost.
   - Net annual profit = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

5. **Break-Even Point:**
   - We need to find the number of years \(n\) such that the total net profit equals or exceeds the initial cost.
   - The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\).
   - We set up the equation: \(7.5n \geq 90\).

6. **Solve for \(n\):**
   \[
   7.5n \geq 90
   \]
   \[
   n \geq \frac{90}{7.5}
   \]

   n \geq 12
   \]

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{12}\) years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house.

2. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Vacuum cleaners sold to the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

4. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

5. **Vacuum cleaners left:**
   According to the problem, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

6. **Solve the equation:**
   First, eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's determine the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find out how many students are left after accounting for those who enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of the remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. We calculate this as follows:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we determine the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit at the end of the month, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: \( 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125 \)

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: \( 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096 \)

Now, we compare the final values:
- Jewelry: $5125
- Electronic Gadgets: $8096

The electronic gadgets will yield a higher value at the end of the month. The profit from the electronic gadgets is the final value minus the initial value:
\[ 8096 - 8000 = 96 \]

Thus, the profit from purchasing the electronic gadgets is:
\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to sum the distances traveled in each direction.

1. **First Day:**
   - Both trains travel westward for 80 miles.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Both trains travel northward for 150 miles.

Since both trains follow the same route and travel the same distances, we can calculate the total distance for one train and then state the result for the other train.

For one train:
- Distance traveled westward: 80 miles
- Distance traveled northward: 150 miles

Total distance covered by one train:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{230 \text{ miles}} \]"

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we add her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"

Step 4: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks is \(\frac{84}{12} = 7\) dozens.

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to hike the 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the time already spent hiking:**
   - First 4 miles: 1 hour
   - Next 2 miles: 1 hour
   \[
   \text{Time already spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining time to hike the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time already spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining distance to hike:**
   - Total distance: 12 miles
   - Distance already hiked: 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of \(\boxed{6}\) miles per hour."
"To determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before spilling:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67\) liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water spilled:**
   - Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, and the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water spilled = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67\) liters.

3. **Calculate the remaining amount of water in the orange drink:**
   - Remaining water in the orange drink = \(\frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6\) liters.

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is \(\boxed{15}\) liters."
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Determine the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
3. Calculate the number of years ago Raymond's son was born based on Samantha's current age.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond's current age is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Raymond had his son at the age of 23. Therefore, the age difference between Raymond and his son is:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years} \]
This means Raymond's son is currently:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \text{ years old} \]

To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract his current age from Samantha's current age:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

Thus, Raymond's son was born \(\boxed{2}\) years ago."

"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time the candle burns.
2. Determine how much the candle melts in that time.

First, let's find the total time the candle burns. The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The time difference between these two times is:
\[ 5:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. Therefore, in 4 hours, the candle will melt:
\[ 2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm} \]

So, the candle will be \(\boxed{8}\) centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price. This is because a 25% discount means Kyle paid 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price.

Let's denote the original price of the book by \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can express this relationship with the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \(\boxed{26}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the boxes of pizza.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[\frac{17}{8.50} = 2\]

So, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza."
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item and then sum these costs.

First, we calculate the total cost for the shorts:
\[
3 \text{ pairs of shorts} \times \$16.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 16.50 = \$49.50
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the pants:
\[
3 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$22.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 22.50 = \$67.50
\]

Then, we calculate the total cost for the shoes:
\[
3 \text{ pairs of shoes} \times \$42 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 42 = \$126
\]

Finally, we sum the costs of all the items:
\[
\$49.50 + \$67.50 + \$126 = \$243
\]

Thus, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is:
\[
\boxed{243}

1. Identify the total distance of the trip: 60 miles.
2. Determine the distance traveled before the first stop: 20 miles.
3. Determine the distance remaining after the first stop: \(60 - 20 = 40\) miles.
4. Determine the distance of the trip from the first stop to the end: 15 miles.
5. Calculate the distance traveled between the first and second stops by subtracting the distance from the second stop to the end from the remaining distance after the first stop: \(40 - 15 = 25\) miles.

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the cost of the other pair of high heels is twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

The problem also states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell's and Allen's current ages. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age. Since Allen's age is \(11x\):

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the guesses from each friend.
2. Calculate the average of these guesses.

First, let's denote the guesses:
- The first friend's guess is 80.
- The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. So, we calculate half of 80 and then add 20:
  \[
  \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
  \]
- The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. So, we calculate 25% of 80 and then add it to 80:
  \[
  \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
  \]

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Calculate the daily time spent on each dog:
   Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.

2. Calculate the total daily time spent on all dogs:
   John has 10 dogs, so the total daily time is:
   \[
   10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. Calculate the weekly time spent on all dogs:
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly time is:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. **Determine the number of jewels Aaron has:**

"To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Points scored in the first 20 minutes:**
   Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.

2. **Points scored in the second 20 minutes:**
   Mike scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more points, we calculate:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5
   \]

3. **Total points scored:**
   To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

   4 + 5 = 9
   \]

Thus, the total points Mike scored is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This can be calculated by dividing 60 by 4:

\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets at $15 each:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, we determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games at $20 each:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the total amount of money he had initially minus the cost of the video games equals $5. We can set up the following equation to find out how much money he had initially:

\[ \text{Initial money} - 160 = 5 \]

Solving for the initial money:

\[ \text{Initial money} = 160 + 5 = 165 \]

Since John initially had $195 from selling the lego sets, and he spent $160 on video games and had $5 left, we need to check if there was any discrepancy. However, the problem states he has $5 left, which means the $195 was correctly used in the transactions described.

Since John sold all his lego sets and the problem does not mention any remaining lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run each day:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours
   - Third day: \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours

2. **Total distance run in a week:**
   - Total distance = Distance on the first day + Distance on the second day + Distance on the third day
   - Total distance = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

3. **Total time run in a week:**
   - Total time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours

4. **Total distance run in a week:**
   - Total distance = 60 miles

5. **Average speed:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Average speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to first find her walking and running speeds, and then calculate the distances she covers while running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana's skipping speed is given as 3 miles per hour.
   - Her running speed is half of her skipping speed.
   \[
   \text{Running speed} = \frac{3 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed.
   \[
   \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1.5 \text{ miles per hour}}{4} = 0.375 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time available is 6 hours.
   - She spends one-third of the time running.
   \[
   \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - She spends two-thirds of the time walking.
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   \[
   \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   \[
   \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 0.375 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ miles}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the throwing distance with the sapphire gemstone:**
   - Polly's normal throwing distance without the gemstone is 400 feet.
   - With the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.
   - Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
     \[
     400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the safe distance outside the dragon's reach:**
   - The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet.
   - To ensure Polly is outside the dragon's reach, she needs to stand at least 1000 feet away from the dragon.
   - Since Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet, she can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit it.

3. **Determine the additional distance outside the dragon's reach:**
   - The maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin is 1200 feet.
   - The dragon's reach is 1000 feet.
   - Therefore, the additional distance outside the dragon's reach is:
     \[
     1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of calories in the entire 300g bag of chips. Since the bag has 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day after consuming 1800 calories. If the daily calorie target is 2000 calories, then the remaining calories are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of the bag of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories. Since the entire 300g bag contains 1250 calories, the number of grams that can be consumed per calorie is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

Therefore, the number of grams that can be consumed with 200 calories is:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \) articles.
  \[
  \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
  \]
  So, on Tuesday, she wrote:
  \[
  5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, she wrote:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

- The distance to be traveled back is 30 miles.
- The speed on the return trip is 6 miles per hour.
- The time \(T\) to travel back is given by:
  \[
  T = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours}
  \]

Thus, the time it takes Tom to get back is \(\boxed{5}\) hours."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:
\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. The remaining weight to be removed is:
\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys need to be removed to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide 7.5 by \( \frac{1}{2} \):
\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys."
"First, let's calculate the revenue earned on Thursday.

- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each:
  \[
  6 \times 60 = 360 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  4 \times 40 = 160 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Total revenue on Thursday:
  \[
  360 + 160 = 520 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue earned on Friday.

- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires, so the revenue from truck tires is:
  \[
  0 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Total revenue on Friday:
  \[
  480 + 0 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue. The higher revenue day is Thursday, with $520, and Friday, with $480.

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
\[
520 - 480 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the mechanic earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more on Thursday."

8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

The total amount of water initially was 24 liters. To find out how much water is left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:

\[
24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the amount of water left is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"To determine how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary arithmetic operations step by step.

1. **Initial number of stickers:**
   Charlie starts with 10 stickers.

2. **Stickers bought from the store:**

"First, let's calculate Alex's weight. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Grace's weight is 125 pounds.

So, 4 times Grace's weight is:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds} \]

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than this amount, so:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, their combined weights are:
\[ \boxed{623} \]"
"To find the total number of thorns, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses.
2. Calculate the total number of thorns based on the total number of roses.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses.**

Dan plants 3 rose bushes, and each rose bush has 25 roses. Therefore, the total number of roses is:
\[ 3 \text{ rose bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of thorns.**

Each rose has 8 thorns. Therefore, the total number of thorns is:
\[ 75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns} \]

So, the total number of thorns is:
\[
\boxed{600}

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the number of games the team won is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing.
2. Determine the number of vacation blocks he has per year.
3. Multiply the number of years by the number of vacation blocks per year to find the total number of blocks.

First, we calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing. He started vacationing at age 23 and is now 34. Therefore, the number of years he has been vacationing is:
\[ 34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years} \]

Next, we know that Gene goes on 4 vacations each year. So, the number of vacation blocks he has per year is 4. Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks is:
\[ 11 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ blocks/year} = 44 \text{ blocks} \]

Thus, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is:
\[
\boxed{44}

"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of rings for each of the three alarms and then sum them up.

1. **First alarm:**
   - The first alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second alarm:**
   - The second alarm rang for three times as long as the first alarm.
   - Since the first alarm rang 4 times, the second alarm rang \(3 \times 4 = 12\) times.

3. **Third alarm:**
   - The third alarm rang for half as long as the second alarm.
   - Since the second alarm rang 12 times, the third alarm rang \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) times.

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald combined is 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold \(\boxed{8000}\) copies."
"First, let's determine how many guests are expected to actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, this means that 3/4 of the invited guests will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends. The number of guests expected to attend is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12
\]

Next, we need to calculate the number of gift bags required. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest. Therefore, the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[
0.75 \times 12 = 9

"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adults and the children.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad that the adults will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
\text{Total for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ pounds/adult} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) pounds.
- There are 5 children.

\[
\text{Total for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ pounds/child} = 25 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we add the amounts for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad needed:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ pounds} + 25 \text{ pounds} = 225 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."

"To determine Jackson's age, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the four kids step by step.

1. Let's denote the ages of Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James as \( A \), \( J \), \( C \), and \( M \) respectively.
2. We know from the problem that:
   - James is 10 years old, so \( M = 10 \).
   - James is 1 year younger than Corey, so \( C = M + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \).
   - Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so \( A = J + 5 \).
   - Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so \( A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \).

Now, we can use the information about Amy's age to find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
Since \( A = 9 \), we substitute 9 for \( A \):
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
To find \( J \), we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
\[ J = 9 - 5 = 4 \]

Thus, Jackson is \(\boxed{4}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Since Lee now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. If Gerald's speed improved by 10%, his new time will be 90% of his original time. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times 0.90 = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, which includes rabbits, dogs, and cats. Let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. **Number of Dogs:**
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 60
   \]

2. **Number of Cats:**
   According to the problem, there are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Combined Number of Dogs and Cats:**
   \[
   \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Number of Rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
   \]

5. **Total Number of Pets:**
   The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
   \]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[
\boxed{348}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

The total number of students is 200. Given that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Next, we find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

We are told that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[
\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[
\text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40
\]

Thus, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"First, we need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[
\text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, Harry slept \(\boxed{3}\) more hours than James."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes before processing.

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before processing**: Since the sauce made is 32 ounces and it is half the volume of the tomatoes, the volume of the tomatoes before processing is:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes in 4 cans is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of tomatoes Freda used is:

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
- 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
- Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be calculated by adding the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes, and then subtracting the 5 cars that took an exit. This total should equal the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has before giving any away. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, the total number of potted plants she has initially is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary decides to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

After giving away these 40 plants, the number of potted plants she will have left is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Mary also received 18 new potted plants from her plant nursery. Adding these to the remaining plants gives:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box and then calculate its inner volume. Finally, we will multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Substituting the inner dimensions:
     \[
     V = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
     \[

Thus, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\) cubic inches."
"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to account for the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week and subtract the known durations.

First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on the other days:
- **Monday and Tuesday**: 1 hour each night.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]
- **Thursday**: 1 hour and a 30-minute show.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
  \]
- **Friday**: 2 hours.
  \[
  2 \text{ hours}
  \]

Next, we sum the hours from Monday, Thursday, and Friday:
\[
2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week. Therefore, the hours watched on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the known hours from the total:
\[
7 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we need to find how many 30-minute episodes make up 1.5 hours:
\[
\frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes}
\]

Thus, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
2x + 15 - 5 = 110
\]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
2x + 10 = 110
\]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[
2x = 100
\]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[
x = 50
\]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas.**

The price per gallon is $3.00. Therefore, the cost for 10 gallons is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons.**

The cashback is $0.20 per gallon. Therefore, the cashback for 10 gallons is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the total cashback from the total cost.**

The final cost after the cashback is:
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the final cost of 10 gallons of gas after the cashback reward is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total number of roll-ups Beatrice had is calculated as:
  \[
  2 \times 24 = 48
  \]

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total number of roll-ups Marcell had is calculated as:
  \[
  3 \times 14 = 42
  \]

Next, we find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice combined:
\[
48 + 42 = 90
\]

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten by each person, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 64 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 64 \times \frac{20}{16} = 64 \times 1.25 = 80 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat:**
   \[
   \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water that enters the boat over the 80 feet:**
   \[
   \text{Total water} = 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} = 16 \text{ liters}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water that the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total amount of sugar and water used. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total parts of the mixture are \(7 + 13 = 20\) parts.

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. This total corresponds to the 20 parts in the ratio. To find the value of one part, we divide the total amount by the total number of parts:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

Since the amount of sugar used corresponds to 7 parts of the ratio, we can find the total amount of sugar by multiplying the value of one part by 7:
\[
\text{Amount of sugar} = 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday:**
   Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday each day.
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours per day}
   \]
   Therefore, for both Tuesday and Wednesday:
   \[
   6 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:**
   Sadie slept 1 hour more than the 6 hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   \[
   6 + 1 = 7 \text{ hours per day}
   \]
   Therefore, for the remaining 4 days:

"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts based on her running speeds.

1. **First 3 hours:**
   - Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in the first 3 hours: 
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Remaining 4 hours:**
   - After the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in the remaining 4 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Total distance:**
   - Adding the distances from both parts:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}
     \]

"First, we need to determine how many letters Jennie put stamps on. She put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters that needed stamps. We calculate this as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters. These 20 letters are now part of the pile of already-stamped letters. We know that after she put stamps on these 20 letters, the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30. Therefore, the number of letters that were already in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie added the 20 new ones is:

\[
30 - 20 = 10

"Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

Initially, Julia had \( x \) spoons from the package she bought. Her husband then gave her a package of 5 spoons, so the total number of spoons she had at that point was:
\[ x + 5 \]

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons left after using 3 spoons is:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 \]

According to the problem, after using 3 spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by subtracting 2 from both sides:
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is \(\boxed{10}\)."

The number of questions Mark completed in the first test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions and he completed 40 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Next, let's analyze the second test:
- The test consisted of 100 questions.
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions Mark completed in the second test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions and he completed 30 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Thus, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[
\boxed{105}

"To find the number of pink gumballs, we start by defining the relationship given in the problem. Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that the number of blue gumballs \( B \) is 12. Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]

Now, we perform the multiplication and addition:
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars are available. We know the total number of cars and the number of automatic and manual cars.

1. Total number of cars: 20
2. Number of automatic cars: 12
3. Number of manual cars: 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of the total number of cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the number of each type of bee:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B = 2Q \) into the equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ W + B + Q = 4Q + 2Q + Q = 7Q = 700. \]

Solving for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400. \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."
"First, let's determine how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we calculate:

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we calculate:

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the non-food items are the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. The milk and eggs are considered food items.

The cost of the non-food items is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

The total cost of the non-food items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the food items (milk and eggs):
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

The total cost of the food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items including tax to get the total cost:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of clients Kim will have. He currently has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so the total number of clients will be:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total expenses for the bleach and cloths. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle and the cost of cloths is $5 per pack. Therefore, the cost for one client is:

\[ 2 \text{ bottles} \times \$2/\text{bottle} + 1 \text{ pack} \times \$5/\text{pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \]

Since Kim will have 8 clients, the total expenses will be:

\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times \$9/\text{client} = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare per year:**
   - John has 10 hectares.
   - There are 100 pineapples per hectare.
   - Therefore, the total number of pineapples per hectare per year is:
     \[
     100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 1 \text{ hectare} = 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of harvests per year:**
   - John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of harvests per year is:
     \[
     \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested per year:**
   - Each hectare yields 100 pineapples per harvest.
   - John has 10 hectares.
   - Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest for all hectares is:
     \[
     100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest}
     \]
   - Since there are 4 harvests per year, the total number of pineapples harvested in a year is:
     \[
     1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year}
     \]

Thus, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:
\[
\boxed{4000}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: 30 bees

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15\) bees

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: \(2 \times 30 = 60\) bees

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: All the bees that left in the first 6 hours and the next 6 hours, minus those that had already returned in the previous 6 hours.
   - Bees that left in the first 6 hours and the next 6 hours: \(30 + 60 = 90\) bees
   - Bees that had already returned in the previous 6 hours: 15 bees
   - Therefore, the number of bees returning in the last 6 hours: \(90 - 15 = 75\) bees

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Steve takes less time to get home, he is the winner. The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting for the loser (Tim) for \(\boxed{4}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the number of tires Shawnda inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we sum the total number of tires inflated:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost in cents is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar):
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's work backwards from the end to the beginning:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon stole \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). Therefore, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate their 9 fries, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate its 7 fries, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate his 14 fries, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

Thus, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on classes each week:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
  - He has 3 classes each day.
  - Each class is 1 hour long.
  - Therefore, the total hours for these three days is:
    \[
    3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
    \]

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
  - He has 2 classes each day.
  - Each class is 2 hours long.
  - Therefore, the total hours for these two days is:
    \[
    2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
    \]

Next, we add the hours from all five days to find the total weekly hours:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester (16 weeks):
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
\boxed{272}

"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches and then convert the total length to feet.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \( 300 \times 4 = 1200 \) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Convert the length of each baguette to inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches): \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) inches.
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \( 60 \times 24 = 1440 \) inches.

Next, we sum the total lengths in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches (rolls)} + 720 \text{ inches (croissants)} + 1440 \text{ inches (baguettes)} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, convert the total length from inches to feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
\[ \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is:
\[

   \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. The football field is 100 yards long, and Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Therefore, the distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 2 \times 100 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back), and she does this 34 times. Therefore, the distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 2 \times 40 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distances they run is:

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( P_0 = 20 \) dollars
   - Increase rate: 20% every two months

2. **Express the increase rate as a decimal:**
   - 20% = 0.20

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   - Number of two-month periods = \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\)

4. **Use the formula for compound interest to find the final price:**
   - The formula for the final price after \( n \) periods of increase is:
     \[
     P_n = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n
     \]
   - Here, \( P_0 = 20 \), \( r = 0.20 \), and \( n = 18 \).

5. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
   \]
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

6. **Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):**
   - Using a calculator:
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366
     \]

7. **Multiply the result by the original price:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. **Calculate the lost income from doing taxes herself:**
   - Jackie loses $35 per hour for 3 hours.
   - Lost income = \( 35 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \)
   - Lost income = \( 105 \, \text{dollars} \)

2. **Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.
   - Difference in cost = Lost income - Accountant's fee
   - Difference in cost = \( 105 \, \text{dollars} - 90 \, \text{dollars} \)
   - Difference in cost = \( 15 \, \text{dollars} \)

Therefore, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have \(\boxed{15}\) dollars more."
"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she is purchasing and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- CD burner: €102
- Printer: €102

Next, we sum these costs:
\[
1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 + 102
\]

We can add these step by step:
\[
1090 + 157 = 1247
\]
\[
1247 + 74 = 1321
\]
\[
1321 + 102 = 1423
\]
\[
1423 + 102 = 1525
\]

The total cost of the items is €1525. Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
\[
1500 - 1525 = -25
\]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Elvira will be €25 over her budget. Therefore, she will not have any money left for her clothing, and in fact, she will need to find an additional €25 to cover the total cost.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-25}
\]"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, the total number of eggs needed is:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
   \[
   S = 2B
   \]
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   B + S + 4 = 28
   \]
   Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
   \[
   B + S = 24
   \]

Now we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
B + 2B = 24
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3B = 24
\]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[
B = 8
\]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[
S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

So, Seth is \(\boxed{16}\) years old."
"First, let's identify the amount of money Ethel has, which is $8. According to the problem, Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. We can express this relationship with the following steps:

1. Calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16
   \]

2. Add $2 to the result from step 1 to find out how much money Jimmy has:
   \[
   16 + 2 = 18
   \]

So, Jimmy has \(\boxed{18}\) dollars."
"To determine how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to break down his walking schedule:

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - Pancho walks 20 miles each day.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Total miles walked on weekdays: \( 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Pancho walks 10 miles each day.
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - Total miles walked on weekends: \( 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Total miles walked in a week:**
   - Sum of miles walked on weekdays and weekends: \( 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the hat:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the hat} = \$25
   \]

2. **Cost of the jacket:**
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times \$25 = \$75
   \]

3. **Cost of the pants:**
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket.
   \[
   \text{Average cost} = \frac{\text{Cost of the hat} + \text{Cost of the jacket}}{2} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = \$50
   \]

4. **Total cost of the uniform:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the hat} + \text{Cost of the jacket} + \text{Cost of the pants} = 25 + 75 + 50 = \$150
   \]

Thus, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[
\boxed{150}
\]"
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each type of invertebrate and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders:**

   - Legs per spider: 8
   - Total legs from spiders: \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \)

2. **Insects:**
   - Number of insects: 90
   - Legs per insect: 6
   - Total legs from insects: \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \)

3. **Rare mutant invertebrates:**
   - Number of rare mutant invertebrates: 3
   - Legs per rare mutant invertebrate: 10
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is \(\boxed{1210}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of the four birds based on the given relationships and then find their total age.

1. **Determine the age of Sally Thirtytwo:**
   - Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Sally Four:**
   - Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
   - Therefore, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

3. **Determine the age of Granny Red:**
   - Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
   - Since Sally Four is 8 years old, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of Sally Two:**
   - Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
   - Since Granny Red is 16 years old, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

5. **Calculate the total age of the four birds:**
   - Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years
   - Sally Four: 8 years
   - Granny Red: 16 years
   - Sally Two: 19 years

   Adding these ages together:
   \[
   8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 41

"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make for all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12 (the number of months in a year):

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{18000}
\]"
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time spent on peeling and cutting each potato and then multiply by the number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to find the total time for peeling and cutting all the potatoes.

### Peeling Time Calculation
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes: \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \)

### Cutting Time Calculation
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes: \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \)

Convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \)

### Total Time Calculation
- Total time for peeling: 90 minutes
- Total time for cutting: 5 minutes
- Total prep time: \( 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \)

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[
\boxed{95 \text{ minutes}}
\]"
"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let \( C \) be their total cost.
   - Profit is calculated as: 
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C
     \]
   - Rearrange to find the total revenue:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = C + 25
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost:**
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons of lemonade they made.
   - The cost per gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is:
     \[
     3 + 2 = 5 \text{ dollars per gallon}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for \( G \) gallons is:
     \[
     C = 5G
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue in terms of \( G \):**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, the revenue from one gallon is:
     \[
     20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars per gallon}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total revenue for \( G \) gallons is:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 10G
     \]

4. **Set up the equation and solve for \( G \):**
   - Substitute the expressions for total revenue and total cost into the profit equation:
     \[
     10G = 5G + 25
     \]
   - Subtract \( 5G \) from both sides:
     \[
     5G = 25
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5:
     \[
     G = 5
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
     \[
     5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."

   - Let the number of girls on the Chinese team be \( G \).
   - The total number of Chinese participants is the sum of boys and girls: \( 60 + G = 160 \)

3. **Solve for \( G \):**
   \[
   60 + G = 160
   \]
   \[
   G = 160 - 60
   \]
   \[
   G = 100

   \]

2. **Car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total spent on rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   1500 + 2000 = 3500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   6000 - 3500 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Donation to charity:**
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Remaining amount after donation:**
   \[
   2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Amount given to daughter:**
   \[
   200 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of crabs Bo has.
2. Use Bo's number of crabs to find out how many crabs Monic has.
3. Use Monic's number of crabs to find out how many crabs Rani has.
4. Sum the number of crabs each person has.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as \( B \). So, \( B = 40 \).

Next, we need to find out how many crabs Monic has. According to the problem, Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Let's denote the number of crabs Monic has as \( M \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ M = B - 4 \]
Substituting the value of \( B \):
\[ M = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many crabs Rani has. The problem states that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Let's denote the number of crabs Rani has as \( R \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ R = M + 10 \]
Substituting the value of \( M \):
\[ R = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Finally, we need to find the total number of crabs the three have together. We do this by summing the number of crabs each person has:
\[ \text{Total} = B + M + R \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Total} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is \(\boxed{122}\)."
"To determine how much Lloyd earned over the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate his earnings for the first week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the first week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours worked} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate his earnings for the second week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the second week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours worked} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both weeks to find the total earnings:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings for the first week} + \text{Earnings for the second week} = 50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned \(\boxed{130}\) dollars for the first two weeks."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we start by calculating the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes. Given that the total number of students who voted is 80, we can find the number of votes the winner received by calculating:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

This means the winner received 60 votes. Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. Let the number of white carnations be \( w \).
2. According to the problem, the number of pink calla lilies is 200, which is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   5w = 200
   \]
3. Solving for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
   \]
   So, the number of white carnations is 40.
4. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is:
   \[
   4w = 4 \times 40 = 160
   \]

Thus, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{160}\) red roses by 5 pm."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine Jean's age given the relationships between Jean's, Mark's, and Jan's ages.

1. **Identify Jan's age:**
   Jan is 30 years old.

2. **Express Mark's age in terms of Jan's age:**
   Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, two years ago, Mark was \(14 + 5 = 19\).

3. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   Since two years have passed, Mark's current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

4. **Determine Jean's age:**
   Jean is two years older than Mark.

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time for the well-rounded team.**

Each member of the well-rounded team runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time is:
\[
4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team.**

The less well-rounded team's times are as follows:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time for the less well-rounded team is:
\[
60 + 57 + 54 + 51
\]

We can add these times step by step:
\[
60 + 57 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 54 = 171
\]
\[
171 + 51 = 222
\]

So, the total time for the less well-rounded team is 222 seconds.

**Step 3: Determine the difference in time between the two teams.**

The difference in time is:
\[
222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then find the difference between these probabilities, expressed as a percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:

\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in probabilities

Now, we find the difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:

\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]

### Step 4: Convert the difference to a percentage

To express the difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
\]

### Final Answer

\[
\boxed{25\%}

1. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces of straw}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits is 20.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed among all the small rodents is 160.
   - Subtract the pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total:
     \[
     160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces (hamsters)} - 20 \text{ pieces (rabbits)} = 90 \text{ pieces of straw}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of rats and the number of pieces of straw each rat receives:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats.
   - The total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is:
     \[
     6r = 90
     \]
   - Solve for \( r \):
     \[
     r = \frac{90}{6} = 15
     \]

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - The total number of rats is 15, so:
     \[
     3n = 15
     \]
   - Solve for \( n \):
     \[
     n = \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the compounded interest over these months. The initial amount Mandy owes is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%.

The formula for the amount after \( n \) months with a monthly interest rate \( r \) is:
\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount after \( n \) months,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate,
- \( n \) is the number of months.

Here, \( P = 100 \), \( r = 0.02 \), and \( n = 3 \).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]

Next, we calculate \( (1.02)^3 \):
\[ (1.02)^3 = 1.02 \times 1.02 \times 1.02 \approx 1.061208 \]

So,
\[ A \approx 100 \times 1.061208 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict is:
\[ \boxed{106.12} \]"

\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The total profit from selling \( x \) bags is given as $400. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 8:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the number of bags the trader sold is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each of them paid:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, the amount each of them paid is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine how many peaches John collects, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends collecting peaches.
2. Determine how many peaches he collects per minute.

First, we know that John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total number of minutes as follows:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly requirement of insects for the flock.
2. Convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for a flock of ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly requirement by 7:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. Therefore, the net increase in the number of trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Number of trees left**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

Thus, the number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are:
     \[
     18 - 6 = 12
     \]
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out on the yard.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is:
     \[
     12 + 18 = 30
     \]
   - The number of white flamingos is still 6.

4. **Finding the Difference:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is:
     \[
     30 - 6 = 24
     \]

Thus, at noon on Sunday, there were \(\boxed{24}\) more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has in total.

1. **Initial Number of Cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards Collected in the First Month:**
   She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Cards Collected in the Second Month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

4. **Cards Collected in the Third Month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

5. **Total Number of Cards:**
   Now, we sum up all the cards she had initially and the cards she collected over the three months.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday:**
   - Rose bought 4 cakes.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday.
   - Number of cakes on Tuesday = \(3 \times 4 = 12\).

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
   - Number of cakes on Wednesday = \(5 \times 12 = 60\).

Now, we sum the number of cakes bought over the three days:
- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

Total number of cakes = \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\).

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each cup. Let's break down the information given and solve it step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Let the cost of one cup be \( x \).
   - Twenty dozen cups mean \( 20 \times 12 = 240 \) cups.
   - The total cost for 240 cups is \( 240x \).

3. **Set up the relationship between the cost of cups and plates:**
   - According to the problem, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:

   \]

Thus, the cost of each cup is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and the shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn. She earns $4 each time, so her total earnings from mowing the lawn are \(4x\) dollars.
- Sara already has $10 saved, so her total savings before mowing the lawn are \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars.

We need to find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes. The total amount of money Sara needs is $70. Therefore, we set up the following equation:
\[30 + 4x = 70\]

To solve for \(x\), we first subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
\[4x = 40\]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[x = 10\]

So, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's define the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as \( w = r + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has \( \boxed{4} \) red chickens."

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons and in the small pool as \( S \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that currently, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

So, Lori will have to work \(\boxed{44}\) hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed. 

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to determine the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned to find the remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of roses in the vase.
2. Calculate the number of dahlias in the vase.
3. Add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers.

Step 1: Identify the number of roses.
The problem states there are 4 roses in the vase.

Step 2: Calculate the number of dahlias.
The problem states there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Since there are 4 roses, the number of dahlias is:
\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Step 3: Add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers.
The total number of flowers is the sum of the roses and the dahlias:
\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. **Harriet's Age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Zack's Age:**
   Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, Zack's age is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Adrian's Age:**
   Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. Therefore, Adrian's age is:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years.

1. **Harriet's Age in Three Years:**
   \[
   \text{Harriet's age in three years} = 21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Zack's Age in Three Years:**
   \[
   \text{Zack's age in three years} = 42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Adrian's Age in Three Years:**
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age in three years} = 63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years old}
   \]

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years.

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years}}{3}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:

\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine how many points Jojo scored, we need to first calculate the points scored by each of the other three students: Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna.

1. **Naomi's Points:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Points:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. First, we calculate half of Naomi's points:
   \[
   \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   Then, we add 10 to this value:
   \[
   34 + 10 = 44
   \]
   So, Yuri scored 44 points.

3. **Brianna's Points:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Therefore, we add 17 to Naomi's points:
   \[
   68 + 17 = 85
   \]
   So, Brianna scored 85 points.

4. **Total Points:**
   The total points scored by all four students is 251. We can verify this by summing the points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 = 197
   \]
   To find Jojo's points, we subtract the total points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total:
   \[
   251 - 197 = 54
   \]

Thus, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent solving puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on Sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one Sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 Sudoku puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on Sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is:

"To find the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then add the two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.

\[
\text{Cost for Carlos} = 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.

\[
\text{Cost for Benji} = 18 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for Carlos} + \text{Cost for Benji} = 90 \, \text{dollars} + 90 \, \text{dollars} = 180 \, \text{dollars}

"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of Pokemon card James has after the changes:

- **Fire type**: 30 (unchanged)
- **Grass type**: 20 + 14 = 34
- **Water type**: 40 - 8 = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has now:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

Now, we need to find the probability that a randomly picked card is a water type. This is given by the ratio of the number of water type cards to the total number of cards, expressed as a percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:
\[ 33 \]

2. **Extra meat**: $2.00
3. **Extra cheese**: $1.00
4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **2 sauces**: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. **Upgrade for chips and a drink**: $3.00

First, we add up all the additional costs:
\[ 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 7.50 \]

Now, we add the base burrito cost to the total of the additional costs:
\[ 6.50 + 7.50 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total:

"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, their combined rate is \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time it takes them to complete the puzzle is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm.
2. Determine the number of watermelons remaining after she took the ready ones home.
3. Calculate how many of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later.
4. Determine the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest initially.**

The farm produced 120 baby watermelons, and 30% of them were ready for harvest.
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]
So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm.

**Step 2: Determine the number of watermelons remaining after she took the ready ones home.**

Subtract the number of ready watermelons from the total number of watermelons.
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]
So, 84 watermelons remained after Ashlyn took the ready ones home.

**Step 3: Calculate how many of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later.**

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]
So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later.

**Step 4: Determine the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.**

Subtract the number of ready watermelons from the remaining watermelons.
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]
So, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine the total cost Mark pays for the fleet of cars, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars:**
   Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**
   The tax rate is 10%, so the tax on the cars is:
   \[
   \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total registration fee:**
   The registration fee for each car is $1,000, and there are 12 cars.
   \[
   \text{Total registration fee} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs together:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25 = 75

Thus, the total number of insects in the garden is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"To determine how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we start with the total number of penguins, which is 36. According to the problem, one-third of the penguins jump in and swim in the ocean, and another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. We need to calculate the number of penguins that are no longer sunbathing and then subtract this from the total number of penguins.

First, we calculate one-third of 36:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins jump in and swim in the ocean. Another 12 penguins go inside the cave to eat their dinner. Therefore, the total number of penguins that are no longer sunbathing is:
\[
12 + 12 = 24
\]
To find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that are no longer sunbathing from the total number of penguins:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   Ram buys 25 pens. These 25 pens are full and can be used to make new pens by mixing their ink.

2. **First Cycle of Mixing:**
   - Ram uses 25 full pens to mix the ink.
   - From these 25 pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new full pens.
   - After making these 5 new pens, he has 5 empty pens left.

3. **Second Cycle of Mixing:**
   - Now, Ram has 5 empty pens from the first cycle and 5 new full pens from the first cycle, making a total of 10 pens.
   - From these 10 pens, he can make \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \) new full pens.
   - After making these 2 new pens, he has 2 empty pens left.

4. **Third Cycle of Mixing:**
   - Now, Ram has 2 empty pens from the second cycle and 2 new full pens from the second cycle, making a total of 4 pens.
   - From these 4 pens, he can make \( \frac{4}{5} = 0 \) full pens (since 4 is less than 5, he cannot make a full pen).

5. **Total Pens Calculation:**
   - Initially, Ram had 25 pens.
   - After the first cycle, he added 5 new pens, making the total \( 25 + 5 = 30 \) pens.
   - After the second cycle, he added 2 new pens, making the total \( 30 + 2 = 32 \) pens.
   - After the third cycle, he did not add any new pens.

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike still has after he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals and he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he now has:

\[5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals}\]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is:

\[3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters/pen pal} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 30 \text{ pages}\]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages in a week. The time it takes for Mike to write one page is 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing in a week is:

\[30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes}\]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours}\]

So, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[\boxed{3}\]"
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day over 30 days:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final number of minutes Jason has left is:

\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries Griffin had at each stage and how many fries Ginger gave him.

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:**
   \[
   24 \text{ fries}
   \]

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   \[
   5 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After Kyle took 5 fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19 \text{ fries}
   \]

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After Billy took 10 fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin. After receiving \( x \) fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   9 + x \text{ fries}
   \]

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken:
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x \text{ fries}
   \]

6. **Final number of fries Griffin had:**
   We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin \(\boxed{20}\) fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

To find \( f \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \(\boxed{7}\)."

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of pennies in the stack.
2. Convert the number of pennies to dollars.

First, we calculate the number of pennies in the stack. The stack contains two-thirds of the 9,300 pennies in the cup. So, we perform the following calculation:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

To simplify this, we can divide 9300 by 3 and then multiply by 2:

\[
9300 \div 3 = 3100
\]
\[
3100 \times 2 = 6200
\]

So, the stack contains 6200 pennies. Since there are 100 pennies in a dollar, we convert the number of pennies to dollars by dividing by 100:

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the selling price, the transfer fees, the brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total additional costs:**
   The total additional costs are the sum of the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.
   \[
   \text{Total additional costs} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   The net proceeds are the selling price minus the total additional costs and the remaining loan amount.
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000
   \]

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are \(\boxed{118000}\)."
"To determine the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken, we need to break down the problem into several steps and calculate the time for each step.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Time taken: 20 minutes

2. **Heating the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees:**
   - The time taken is 40% longer than the time to heat from room temperature to 300 degrees.

"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary bought, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag contains 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag:
   \[
   300 + 12 = 312
   \]
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[
300 + 312 + 150 = 762
\]

Thus, the total number of M&Ms Mary bought is:
\[
\boxed{762}

"To determine the total number of windows between the houses, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:
     \[
     3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows per bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}
     \]
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:
     \[
     2 \text{ houses} \times 6 \text{ windows per house} = 12 \text{ windows}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of additional windows in each house:**
   - Each house has 4 additional windows.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
     \[
     2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows per house} = 8 \text{ windows}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of windows:**
   - Add the number of windows in the bedrooms to the number of additional windows:
     \[
     12 \text{ windows (bedrooms)} + 8 \text{ windows (additional)} = 20 \text{ windows}
     \]

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the change the mother receives, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased. The items and their respective costs are:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

We add these amounts together to find the total cost:

\[
4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35
\]

First, add the cost of the cocoa and the laundry:

\[
4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65
\]

Next, add the cost of the pasta to this sum:

\[
13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00
\]

The total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[
20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00
\]

Thus, the change the cashier gives back is:

\[
\boxed{5.00}

"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we need to break down the total number of stitches and allocate them according to the given information.

1. **Total number of stitches for the sweater:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches} = 1800
   \]

2. **Stitches for the body of the sweater:**
   \[
   \text{Body stitches} = 900
   \]

3. **Stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body.
   \[
   \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

4. **Stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

5. **Stitches for the sleeves:**
   Let \( S \) be the number of stitches for one sleeve. Since there are two sleeves, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is \( 2S \).

6. **Sum of all stitches:**
   The sum of the stitches for the body, collar, rosette, and sleeves should equal the total number of stitches.
   \[
   900 + 90 + 180 + 2S = 1800
   \]

7. **Solve for \( S \):**
   Combine the known values:
   \[
   1170 + 2S = 1800
   \]
   Subtract 1170 from both sides:
   \[
   2S = 1800 - 1170
   \]
   \[
   2S = 630
   \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[
   S = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

Thus, each sleeve takes \(\boxed{315}\) stitches."
"To determine how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then sum these amounts.

"First, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the small holes. Since it takes him 3 minutes to dig one small hole, for 30 small holes, the time spent is:
\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the large holes. Since it takes him 10 minutes to dig one large hole, for 15 large holes, the time spent is:
\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both small and large holes to get the total time in minutes:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, we substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( S \):
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides to solve for \( 3S \):
\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3 to find \( S \):
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently \(\boxed{6}\) years old."

\]

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is \(\boxed{7}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can set up the following equation for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. Since there are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. Since there are 60 mambas and each mamba has 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

3. Add the totals for all three individuals to get the overall total.

First, let's determine the number of stories each person wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that number in the second week:
  \[
  20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ stories}
  \]
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that number in the second week:
  \[
  40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ stories}
  \]
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that number in the second week:
  \[
  60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ stories}
  \]

Next, we sum the total number of stories each person wrote over the two weeks:
- Alani's total:
  \[
  20 + 40 = 60 \text{ stories}
  \]
- Braylen's total:
  \[
  40 + 80 = 120 \text{ stories}

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and the dimes gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop that costs 55 cents. We subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money Kelly has:

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the 76-star flag, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of stars (76) to find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows.
3. Divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows.

Let's start with the first step:

The three rows of 8 stars contain:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

The two rows of 6 stars contain:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the first five rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

Next, we subtract this number from the total number of stars to find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Now, we divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows:

"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The formula to calculate time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at 30 miles per hour and covers the same distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the slow lane car to cover this distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate the number of medals Izzy has as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we find the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals of Ali and Izzy} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Let's denote the total number of medals given out for counting as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since there are 8 packets and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get. With 4 adults and each getting 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars each child will get is:
\[ \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]

So, each child will get \(\boxed{2}\) chocolate bars."
"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Susan works:**
   - Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.
   - She pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is \(3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Convert the working time into minutes:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, \(2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes}\).

3. **Determine how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:**
   - \(150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals}\).

4. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval.

"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

1. **Mike's points**: Mike has 21 points.
2. **Jim's points**: Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
3. **Tony's points**: Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to check if each player has over 20 points to see if they get an extra point in the fourth round:

1. **Mike**: Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
2. **Jim**: Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim's total remains 18 points.
3. **Tony**: Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players after the fourth round:

\[
22 \text{ (Mike)} + 18 \text{ (Jim)} + 43 \text{ (Tony)} = 83
\]

Thus, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{83}\)."
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges.

Now, we find the total number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will originally bought 15 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of washed oranges from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Thus, the number of oranges left unwashed is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily rice consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - Each person eats rice at lunch and dinner, so each person consumes \(0.2 \, \text{kg} \times 2 = 0.4 \, \text{kg}\) per day.
   - For 5 members, the total daily consumption is \(0.4 \, \text{kg} \times 5 = 2 \, \text{kg}\).

2. **Calculate the total weekly rice consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly consumption is \(2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{kg}\).

3. **Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - The total amount of rice is 42 kg.
   - The weekly consumption is 14 kg.
   - The number of weeks the rice will last is \(\frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}\).

Thus, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Monday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Tuesday: 15 crates.
- Wednesday: 12 crates.
- Thursday: 18 crates.
- Friday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Saturday: 20 crates.
- Sunday: 20 crates.

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Sunday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 + 20 = 85 \]

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 85 = 35 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by \(\boxed{35}\) crates from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. Let's break down the process step by step.

1. **Initial Bid:**
   Carmen starts with the opening bid of $200.

2. **Bids by Other Participants:**
   There are 3 other people who each bid once. Since the bids rise by $50 each time, the bids by the other participants will be:
   - First other participant: $200 + $50 = $250
   - Second other participant: $250 + $50 = $300
   - Third other participant: $300 + $50 = $350

3. **Carmen's Bids:**
   Carmen bids after each of the 3 other participants. Therefore, her bids will be:
   - After the first other participant: $350 + $50 = $400
   - After the second other participant: $400 + $50 = $450
   - After the third other participant: $450 + $50 = $500

4. **Total Cost:**
   The total cost of the desk is the sum of all the bids Carmen makes, including the opening bid:
   \[
   200 + 400 + 450 + 500
   \]

5. **Calculation:**
   \[
   200 + 400 = 600
   \]
   \[
   600 + 450 = 1050
   \]
   \[
   1050 + 500 = 1550
   \]

Thus, the total amount Carmen spends on the desk is \(\boxed{1550}\) dollars."
"To determine how much John pays annually for the driving service, we need to break down the costs into several components and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the daily distance traveled:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, and he has to go there and back each day.
   - Daily distance = \(30 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 60 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Calculate the weekly distance traveled:**
   - John goes to work 5 days a week.
   - Weekly distance = \(60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ miles/week}\).

3. **Calculate the annual distance traveled:**
   - John works 50 weeks a year.
   - Annual distance = \(300 \text{ miles/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year}\).

4. **Calculate the cost per mile:**
   - John is charged $2 per mile.
   - Annual cost for miles = \(15000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars/year}\).

5. **Calculate the monthly bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month.
   - Annual bonus = \(150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year}\).

6. **Calculate the total annual cost:**
   - Total annual cost = Annual cost for miles + Annual bonus
   - Total annual cost = \(30000 \text{ dollars/year} + 1800 \text{ dollars/year} = 31800 \text{ dollars/year}\).

Therefore, the total amount John pays annually for the driving service is:
\[
\boxed{31800}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total amount of time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. According to the problem, on Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes and on Monday he exercised for 16 minutes. Therefore, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday is:

\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how long Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday. The problem states that on Tuesday, he wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time from Monday and Sunday by 2:

\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal is:

\[
\boxed{78}
\]"
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding and printing process. Each piece of paper is folded in half, and when unfolded, it will have 4 pages: the left back, the left front, the right front, and the right back.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the number of pages per piece of paper**: Each piece of paper, when folded and unfolded, will have 4 pages.
2. **Calculate the number of pieces of paper needed**: Since the tabloid has 32 pages and each piece of paper provides 4 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages per piece of paper.
   \[
   \frac{32}{4} = 8
   \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the amount left after spending on rides is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annika has left is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the current year.
   - According to the problem, \( x = 45 \).
   - The number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold in the current year, so it is \( 2x = 2 \times 45 = 90 \).

2. **Determine the number of books sold in the third year:**
   - Let \( y \) be the number of books sold in the third year.
   - The total number of books sold over the three years is the total number of books minus the number of unsold books.
   - Total books: 250
   - Unsold books: 50
   - Total sold books: \( 250 - 50 = 200 \)
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the third year is \( 200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65 \).

3. **Determine the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - The total number of books sold over the three years is 200.
   - The number of books sold in the first year is 90.
   - The number of books sold in the third year is 65.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is \( 200 - (90 + 65) = 200 - 155 = 45 \).

4. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - Number of books sold in the second year: 45.
   - Total money earned in the second year: \( 45 \times 20 = 900 \).

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{900}\)."
"First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage. Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of:

\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ hours/week} \]

At a rate of $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

\[ 50 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of weeks in April. April typically has 4 weeks. Therefore, Watson's total earnings for April are:

\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$3200 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3200}

"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40
\]

Next, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales.

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning sales} = 60 - 40 = 20
\]

Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of the remaining 20 loaves.

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate the weekly weight loss for Joey as follows:

\[
\text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
\]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds per week. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Therefore, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, which is the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks.

Since Sandy loses weight at a rate that allows her to lose 2 pounds per week, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds as follows:

\[
\text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks}
\]

Thus, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the savings from buying the ice cream and the milk separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
\[ 4 \times 0.5 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount saved is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Calculate the number of extra arms:**
   - Arms grow every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times a person will grow an extra arm is:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Calculate the number of extra legs:**
   - Legs grow every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times a person will grow an extra leg is:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Calculate the total number of new limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ (arms)} + 3 \text{ (legs)} = 8 \text{ (limbs)}
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause the person to grow a total of \(\boxed{8}\) new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each:
\[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the suitcases. Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each:
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times the cost of a business suit is:
\[ 5 \times 100 = 500 \]
Adding $700 to this amount gives the cost of the flight ticket:
\[ 500 + 700 = 1200 \]

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the total amount he can spend on the suits, suitcases, and gifts is:
\[ 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \]

Now, we sum the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket to find out how much he has already spent:
\[ 600 + 150 + 1200 = 2000 \]

To find out how much Theo has left to spend on gifts, we subtract the total amount spent on the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket from the amount he can spend:
\[ 4000 - 2000 = 2000 \]

Thus, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Identify the number of people and their egg consumption:**
   - There are 5 people in the family.
   - Three people eat 3 eggs each day.
   - The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

2. **Calculate the daily egg consumption:**
   - The three people who eat 3 eggs each day will consume:
     \[
     3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - The two people who eat 2 eggs each day will consume:
     \[
     2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total daily egg consumption is:
     \[
     9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the weekly egg consumption:**
   - Since they eat eggs every day, the weekly consumption is:
     \[
     13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs}
     \]

Thus, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"To determine Trent's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know Quinn's age is 30.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Therefore, we can calculate Trent's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Thus, Trent is \(\boxed{32}\) years old."
"Let's start by defining the variables and using the information given in the problem.

1. Let \( N \) be Noah's current age.
2. Cera's current age is 46 years.
3. Six years ago, Cera's age was \( 46 - 6 = 40 \) years.
4. Six years ago, Noah's age was \( N - 6 \) years.
5. According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   N - 6 = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   Solving for \( N \):
   \[
   N = 20 + 6 = 26
   \]
   So, Noah's current age is 26 years.

6. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Noah's age six years ago was 20, so the population six years ago was:
   \[
   3000 \times 20 = 60000
   \]
7. The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is:
   \[
   60000 \times 2 = 120000
   \]

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot 3D + 2 \cdot \frac{D}{2} = 2 \cdot 105 \]
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited to her party.

- She invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is:
\[12 + 12 = 24\]

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those who had previous commitments.

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. So, the number of people with previous commitments is:
\[\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\]

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\]

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited to find out how many people actually show up:
\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is:
\[\boxed{14}\]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Marbles bought from Johanna:**
   Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.

2. **Initial marbles in the store:**
   The store already had 50 marbles.

3. **Total marbles before receiving from his father:**
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70 \text{ marbles}
   \]

4. **Marbles given by his father:**
   His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles from Johanna:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ marbles}
   \]

5. **Total marbles after receiving from his father:**
   \[
   70 + 8 = 78 \text{ marbles}

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   - The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet with a depth of 5 feet.
   - The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
     \]
   - Substituting the given dimensions:
     \[
     V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool:**
   - The cost to fill the pool is given as $0.10 per cubic foot.
   - The total cost \( C \) is calculated by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot:
     \[
     C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. **Number of Girls:**
   The classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

2. **Number of Nongendered Children:**
   The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

3. **Total Number of Children:**
   To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children.
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Thus, the total number of children in the classroom is \(\boxed{123}\)."

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \), which means \( P = \frac{W}{3} \).
3. Given \( W = 45 \), we substitute this value into the equation:
   \[
   P = \frac{45}{3} = 15
   \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( \boxed{15} \)."
"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of people at the beginning of the party.
2. Calculate the number of people who left after an hour.
3. Determine the number of women who left.
4. Calculate the number of women who stayed at the party.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of people at the beginning of the party.**

The total number of people is the sum of the number of men and women:
\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of people who left after an hour.**

Since \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the total number of people left, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of women who left.**

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Since the total number of men at the beginning was 25, the number of men who left is:
\[ 25 - 22 = 3 \]

Since 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of women who stayed at the party.**

The number of women who stayed is the total number of women minus the number of women who left:
\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

So, the number of women left at the party is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[
\frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs:

\[
2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils that Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = 26 \]

Since the number of loose pencils is 2, we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

To find the number of pencils in the boxes, we subtract 2 from 26:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

So, Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils.

Next, we know that Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together, we add the number of pencils Jam has to the number of pencils Meg has:

\[ \text{Total number of pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold the same number of pencils as the 24 pencils in Jam's boxes, each box can hold 24 pencils. To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{24} = 3 \]

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes added:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   \[
   \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weakening from the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   \[
   \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening from the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.
   \[
   \text{Weakening from cream} = 15 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weakening:**
   Add the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream.
   \[
   \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the trade ratio and the outcome of the trades.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

Since each new record requires 2 old records, for 7 new records, the total number of old records given up is:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Thus, the 5 people brought in a total of \(\boxed{14}\) old records."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers, their respective monthly salaries, and then calculate the total monthly payment to all programmers.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees.
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is the remaining employees after accounting for the junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

3. **Determine the monthly salary of senior programmers:**
   - Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Monthly salary of senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
   \]

4. **Calculate the total monthly payment to junior programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
   \]

5. **Calculate the total monthly payment to senior programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
   \]

6. **Calculate the total monthly payment to all programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many lollipops Oscar has at the end.

1. **Initial number of lollipops:**
   Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

2. **Lollipops eaten on the way to school:**
   Oscar eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]
   So, he has 22 lollipops left.

3. **Lollipops given to friends:**
   Oscar gives 14 lollipops to his friends.
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
   So, he has 8 lollipops left.

4. **Lollipops bought on the way home:**
   Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave 14 lollipops to his friends, he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
   So, he now has:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
   lollipops.

5. **Lollipops eaten later:**
   Oscar eats 3 more lollipops that night and 2 more in the morning. So, he eats a total of:
   \[
   3 + 2 = 5
   \]
   lollipops.
   Therefore, the number of lollipops left is:
   \[
   36 - 5 = 31
   \]

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the number of percentage points that need to be charged. The phone is currently at 60%, so it needs to be charged by an additional 40 percentage points (100% - 60% = 40%).

The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to find out how many minutes it will take to charge 40 percentage points, we multiply 40 by 3 minutes:

\[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide 120 minutes by 60:

\[ \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, we start with the number of lollipops Erin initially has, which is 7. Her mother gives her an additional 10 lollipops. So, we add these together:

\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \]

Next, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. We subtract these 3 lollipops from the total she has:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of lollipops Erin has left is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. Therefore, the number of $1 rewards they earned is:

\[
\frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars off}
\]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used the $4 off from their rewards. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards were $4, the coupon took:

\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars off}
\]

Now, we calculate the total discount applied to the $43 purchase:

\[
43 - 4 - 8 = 31
\]

Thus, the customer paid:

\[
\boxed{31}

"To determine which job pays more net income, we need to calculate the net pay for both Job A and Job B.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual pay before tax: \( 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \) dollars
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars

**Job B:**
- Annual pay before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \) dollars
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: \( 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \) dollars

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
\[ 32,400 - 24,000 = 8,400 \]

Therefore, Nick will make \(\boxed{8400}\) dollars more at the job with the higher net pay rate."
"First, we need to determine the number of ruined castles in Scotland. Given that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins, we calculate the number of ruined castles as follows:

\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. Therefore, we calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles as follows:

\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]

Thus, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is \(\boxed{44}\)."

- Richard (assuming the question meant Richard, not RJ) has 5 guns.
- Richard (again, assuming the same person) has 5 guns.

Adding these together:

\[ 8 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 28 \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of guns equally among the four individuals:

\[ \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, if they share the guns equally, each of them would have:

\[ \boxed{7} \] guns."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers.
- Therefore, for 8 batches, he needs \( 30 \times 8 = 240 \) ounces of sugar.

Next, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge.
- Therefore, for 1 batch, he needs \( 70 \) ounces of sugar.

Now, add the amounts of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = \( 240 + 70 = 310 \) ounces.

Thus, the total amount of sugar Mason needs is \(\boxed{310}\) ounces."
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each.

\[ \text{Initial value} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. Therefore, the new price per share after the first year is:

\[ \text{New price per share} = \$8 + (0.50 \times \$8) = \$8 + \$4 = \$12 \]

Now, we calculate the value of the 8 shares after the first year:

\[ \text{Value after first year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the second year is:

\[ \text{New price per share} = \$12 - (0.25 \times \$12) = \$12 - \$3 = \$9 \]

Now, we calculate the value of the 8 shares after the second year:

\[ \text{Value after second year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"First, let's determine how many hot dogs each person ate.

1. Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
2. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. Therefore, Thomas ate:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]
3. John ate half the amount Thomas ate. Therefore, John ate:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. We subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:
\[
3 - 2 = 1
\]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. 

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Since the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the larger groups, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students in the class is 200, and the class is split into three groups. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."

     H = 2C
     \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( H = 2C \) into the first equation:
     \[
     C + 2C = 60
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     3C = 60
     \]
   - Solve for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
     \]
   - Now, find \( H \):
     \[
     H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Number of Legs:**
   - Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs.

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. **Pink Frog**: 50 pounds
2. **Blue Beetle**: Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. **Green Toad**: Similarly, the green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. **Yellow Snake**: The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Therefore, the yellow snake weighs:
   \[
   50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]
5. **Red Bird**: The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. Therefore, the red bird weighs:
   \[
   50 - 20 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself, which weighs 20 pounds.

The total weight of the animals is:
\[
50 \text{ (pink frog)} + 50 \text{ (blue beetle)} + 50 \text{ (green toad)} + 60 \text{ (yellow snake)} + 30 \text{ (red bird)} = 260 \text{ pounds}

"To determine the percentage increase in daily earnings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily earnings from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from silos.
3. Determine the increase in daily earnings.
4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the original daily earnings.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily earnings from tractors.**

The factory sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor.
\[
\text{Daily earnings from tractors} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings from silos.**

The factory now sells 5 silos a day and makes $220 per silo.
\[
\text{Daily earnings from silos} = 5 \times 220 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the increase in daily earnings.**

\[
\text{Increase in daily earnings} = \text{Daily earnings from silos} - \text{Daily earnings from tractors} = 1100 - 1000 = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase.**

The percentage increase is calculated based on the original daily earnings from tractors.
\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in daily earnings}}{\text{Daily earnings from tractors}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
\]

Thus, the factory is making \(\boxed{10\%}\) more per day now."

   - Duration: 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes)

4. **Museum tour on Thursday:**
   - Duration: Half the duration of the cooking class
   - Calculation: \( \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \)

5. **Errands on Friday:**
   - Duration: 2 hours

Now, we sum up all the durations:

\[
1 \text{ hour} + 3 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours}
\]

Adding these together:

\[
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. The school asked for twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies. Since they asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies, the number of plant pots needed for the roses is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots required:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:
\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine how much Andrea saved, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total amount of money Andrea had initially.
2. Subtract the amount she spent on the sweater.
3. Subtract the amount she gave to her brother.
4. The result will be the amount she saved.

Let's go through the calculations step by step:

1. Andrea initially had $36.
2. She spent $11 on a sweater. So, the remaining amount after buying the sweater is:
   \[
   36 - 11 = 25
   \]
3. She then gave her brother $4. So, the remaining amount after giving her brother $4 is:
   \[
   25 - 4 = 21
   \]

Therefore, the amount Andrea saved is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"First, let's break down the time John spent on each activity:

1. **Boating**: John spends 6 hours boating.
2. **Swimming**: He spends half the time he spends boating swimming, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.
3. **Watching Shows**: He watches 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so he spends \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours watching shows.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
\[
6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours}
\]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time John spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[
0.30T = 15
\]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[
T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours}
\]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[
0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the time John spent sightseeing is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add her initial savings to the earnings from both jobs to find out how much money she has in total:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the phone is $400. To find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount of money she has from the cost of the phone:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the height of the shortest tree.
2. Calculate the height of the second tree.
3. Find the combined height of the shortest and second trees.
4. Determine the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees.

Let's start with the height of the shortest tree:
\[ \text{Height of the shortest tree} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the height of the second tree:
\[ \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we find the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ \text{Combined height} = 6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet} \]

Finally, we determine the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height:
\[ \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 \text{ feet} = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height of the tallest tree is:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities and then see how many friends can be included within her $90 budget.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends:**
   - A round of mini-golf costs $5.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of friends Morgan can invite. Including Morgan, the total number of people is \( n + 1 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for mini-golf is \( 5 \times (n + 1) \).

2. **Cost of arcade tokens:**
   - Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens for herself.
   - Therefore, the total cost for arcade tokens is $5.

3. **Cost of go-karts:**
   - Each go-kart ride costs $10.
   - Morgan and her friends can ride the go-karts twice each.
   - Therefore, the total cost for go-karts is \( 10 \times 2 \times (n + 1) = 20 \times (n + 1) \).

4. **Total cost equation:**
   - The total cost for all activities is the sum of the costs for mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts.
   - Therefore, the total cost is:
     \[
     5 \times (n + 1) + 5 + 20 \times (n + 1)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     5(n + 1) + 5 + 20(n + 1) = 5n + 5 + 5 + 20n + 20 = 25n + 30
     \]

5. **Set up the budget constraint:**
   - Morgan's budget is $90.
   - Therefore, we set up the inequality:
     \[
     25n + 30 \leq 90
     \]

6. **Solve for \( n \):**
   - Subtract 30 from both sides:
     \[
     25n \leq 60
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 25:
     \[
     n \leq \frac{60}{25} = 2.4
     \]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number (you can't invite a fraction of a friend), the maximum number of friends Morgan can invite is 2.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. Therefore, the total cost of lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa has left after buying the lollipops each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the amount she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} - 1 \text{ dollar/day} = 4 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she will save:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after 5 days is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Billy has after buying the candy:**
   - Billy starts with $10.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy he buys.
   - The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the cost of \( x \) pounds of candy is \( 1.5x \) dollars.
   - After buying the candy, the amount of money left is \( 10 - 1.5x \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the amount of money spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy takes half of his remaining money to buy gumballs.
   - He spends this money on gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05.
   - He buys 40 gumballs, so the total cost of the gumballs is \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, half of his remaining money is $2, which means his remaining money is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.
   - So, \( 10 - 1.5x = 4 \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   10 - 1.5x = 4
   \]
   \[
   10 - 4 = 1.5x
   \]
   \[
   6 = 1.5x
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{6}{1.5} = 4
   \]

So, Billy bought \(\boxed{4}\) pounds of candy."
"Let's denote the age of Carver's son as \( x \) years.

According to the problem, Carver just turned 45 years old, and this age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[
45 = 2x - 5
\]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[
45 + 5 = 2x
\]
\[
50 = 2x
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[
x = \frac{50}{2}
\]
\[
x = 25
\]

Therefore, Carver's son is \(\boxed{25}\) years old."
"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(100 + 75 - 50 = 125\) miles (since it travels 50 miles less than the combined distance of 175 miles).

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it takes to travel 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \]

Therefore, the train needs service every 20 days. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. According to the problem, a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:
\[
3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing required:
\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the current points of Sara and Erin.
2. Determine Erin's points before the recent score.

First, we know that after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara. Sara's current points are 8. Therefore, Erin's current points can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin's current points are 24 and she just scored 14 points, we can find out how many points she had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her current points:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of points Erin had before is:

"To determine how much milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Identify the number of sheep that produce 1 kg of milk and the number that produce 2 kg of milk.
   - Mary has 30 sheep in total.
   - Half of the sheep produce 1 kg of milk, so \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep produce 1 kg of milk.
   - The other half of the sheep produce 2 kg of milk, so \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep produce 2 kg of milk.

2. Calculate the total milk produced by the sheep that produce 1 kg of milk.
   - Each of the 15 sheep produces 1 kg of milk, so the total milk from these sheep is \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg.

3. Calculate the total milk produced by the sheep that produce 2 kg of milk.
   - Each of the 15 sheep produces 2 kg of milk, so the total milk from these sheep is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg.

4. Add the milk produced by both groups of sheep to find the total daily milk collection.

   - Apples picked on Wednesday: 24
   - Total number of apples picked:
     \[
     14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \text{ apples}
     \]

Thus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of socks Lindsay has washed. Since 1 pair of socks consists of 2 socks, washing 10 pairs means she has washed \(10 \times 2 = 20\) socks from pairs. Additionally, she has washed 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is:

\[20 + 15 = 35\]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. If she has washed 35 socks, the number of socks she has missed is:

\[50 - 35 = 15\]

So, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Rachel had after Janet gave her some:

So, Rachel has 21 cookies left."
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest on the loan. The interest rate is 10% per year, and the loan period is five months. Since the interest rate is annual, we need to find the interest for five months. The interest for one year (12 months) on a $3,650 loan at 10% is:

\[ \text{Annual Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 = 365 \]

The interest for five months is:

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = \frac{5}{12} \times 365 = \frac{5 \times 365}{12} = \frac{1825}{12} \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Now, we need to find out how much she has to pay per month. Since she has to pay this amount equally over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's hiking speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

\[
\text{Distance Cho hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's hiking speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

\[
\text{Distance Chloe hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance Cho hiked} - \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km}
\]

Thus, Cho hiked \(\boxed{67}\) kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Axel has 50 silver pesos. Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos. Since Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

- The total number of silver pesos they have together is \(50 + 100 = 150\).
- The total number of gold pesos they have together is \(80 + 120 = 200\).

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together.

\[
150 + 200 = 350
\]

Thus, the total number of pesos they have together is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the total cost. Millie spends $18 on supplies. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ \$18 \]

The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups. The number of hours is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:
\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Thus, the profit Millie makes per hour is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how much land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can follow these steps:

1. Let the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had be \( x \) hectares.
2. According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.
3. We know that the amount of land left is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation by isolating \( x \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
   \]
5. Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
   \]

So, the amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had is \(\boxed{32}\) hectares."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26
\]

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, on the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13
\]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

Let's add them step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400. Next, we divide this sum by the number of tests, which is 5, to find the average:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

- Each eraser costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost of 6 erasers is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

Next, calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- Therefore, the cost of 8 pencils is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

Now, add the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils to find the total cost:
- The total cost is \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

Thus, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. According to the problem, he delivers \( \frac{1}{3} \) as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. Since he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson, the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find the total number of messages delivered by adding the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

Thus, the total number of messages James delivers is:

\[
\boxed{88}

"To determine how much money David saves, we need to compare the cost of buying ride tickets individually versus buying a ride bracelet.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha, who buys individual ride tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets.
- There are 9 rides.
- Each ticket costs $2.

The total number of tickets Dasha needs is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ tickets/ride} = 18 \text{ tickets} \]

The total cost for Dasha's tickets is:
\[ 18 \text{ tickets} \times \$2/\text{ticket} = \$36 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

The total cost for David's ride bracelet is:
\[ \$30 \]

Now, we compare the costs:
- Dasha's total cost: \$36
- David's total cost: \$30

The amount of money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of individual tickets is:
\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, and the total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

First, let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles can be expressed as:
\[
5x + 6x = 165
\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[
11x = 165
\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[
x = \frac{165}{11} = 15
\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[
90 - 75 = 15
\]

Thus, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before any discounts.

- Netflix costs $10 per month.
- Hulu costs $10 per month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 per month.

So, the total cost for these three services before any discounts is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we need to determine the discount Tim gets by bundling these services. The discount is 20%, so we calculate 20% of $30:
\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Tim's original cable subscription cost $60 per month. By switching to the streaming services, his new monthly cost is $24. The amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable subscription is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"First, let's break down the time Carol spends on each activity:

1. **Writing a song**: 4 hours
2. **Recording**: Half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. **Editing**: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)

Next, we calculate the total work time by summing up the time spent on each activity:
\[
4 \text{ hours (writing)} + 2 \text{ hours (recording)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (editing)} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we need to find what percentage of the total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total work time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[
\left( \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{1.5}{7.5} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

Now, convert the fraction to a percentage:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100\% = 20\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:
\[
\boxed{20\%}

"First, let's determine the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours a day, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, he will use the air conditioner for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The new daily energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"

Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new number of cannolis is:
\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the new number of corns.**

Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 more cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]
So, the new number of corns is:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \]

**Step 4: Find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis.**

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is:
\[ 100 + 100 = 200 \]

Thus, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total steps Elliott has already taken:**
   - He finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school.
   - He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
   - After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

2. **Determine the number of steps taken before the jog:**
   - Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, the number of steps he had taken before the jog is:
     \[
     10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
     \]

3. **Calculate the steps taken during the jog:**
   - The steps taken before the jog include the steps to and from school and the short walk with his friend.
   - The steps to and from school are half of 10,000:
     \[
     \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
     \]
   - Adding the 1,000 steps from the short walk with his friend:
     \[
     5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
     \]
   - The remaining steps taken before the jog are:
     \[
     8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
     \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[
\boxed{2000}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, the total time he has before he needs to leave is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, we can now determine how many minutes early he will be:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment per employee in May: \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars
   - Total payment for all employees in May: \( 600 \times 40 = 24000 \) dollars

2. **Calculate the number of employees remaining after June:**
   - Number of employees who left in June: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment per employee in June: \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars
   - Total payment for all employees in June: \( 600 \times 30 = 18000 \) dollars

4. **Calculate the total payment for both months:**
   - Total payment for May: $24000
   - Total payment for June: $18000
   - Total payment for both months: \( 24000 + 18000 = 42000 \) dollars

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \(\boxed{42000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means that for 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since the second pound is half off).

The cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, each costing $0.25:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, we add up all the expenses:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the final amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the second pack of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice that amount:
\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the two packs of fireworks before the discount:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on the total cost of the two packs. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:
\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the two packs to find the discounted price:
\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted price:
\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:
\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days:**
   Shannon eats 2 cookies each night. Over 30 days, the total number of cookies she eats is:
   \[
   2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Convert the total number of cookies into dozens:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we need to convert 60 cookies into dozens:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of madeleine cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of candles that are more dangerous:**
   - Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles are more dangerous and have a higher risk of exploding.
   - If she makes 50,000 candles, the number of more dangerous candles is:
     \[
     50,000 \times 0.01 = 500
     \]

2. **Determine the number of more dangerous candles that also have a defect:**
   - 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
   - Therefore, the number of more dangerous candles that smell like wet dog is:
     \[
     500 \times 0.05 = 25
     \]

3. **Determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode:**
   - Since the problem does not specify that the defect (smelling like wet dog) affects the probability of exploding, we assume that the defect does not change the probability of exploding for these candles.
   - Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is the same as the number of more dangerous candles that have the defect, which is 25.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picks.

First, let's find the discount price of one blouse. The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. This means each blouse is now 70% of its original price (since 100% - 30% = 70%).

The discount price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses. Since each blouse costs $14 after the discount, the total cost for 4 blouses is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the number of apples Joanne gathered from each type of tree:
- From the tallest trees, Joanne gathered 30 apples.
- From the shortest trees, Joanne gathered half of 30 apples, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Let the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees be \( x \).

Next, we calculate the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from each type of tree:
- From the tallest trees, her sister gathered twice as many as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- From the shortest trees, her sister gathered three times as many as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Her sister did not gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of apples as follows:
\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 150 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

Thus, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides, we get:
\[
d = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we will break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the distance for each segment of the trip.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: 
     \[
     200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}
     \]

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days:
     \[
     0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}
     \]

3. **Next day (5th day):**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the 5th day: 
     \[
     0 \text{ km}
     \]

4. **Second week (6th to 14th day):**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week:
     \[
     300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}
     \]

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments of the trip:
\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

Thus, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[
\boxed{3140}
\]"
"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Peter's Locker Size:**
   Peter's locker is given as 5 cubic inches.

2. **Zack's Locker Size:**
   Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, we can express Zack's locker size in terms of Peter's locker size:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times \text{Peter's locker}
   \]
   Substituting the size of Peter's locker:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Timothy's Locker Size:**
   Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can express Timothy's locker size in terms of Zack's locker size:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times \text{Zack's locker}
   \]
   Substituting the size of Zack's locker:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"First, we determine the elevation of the comb after it fell from Stanley's pocket. Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the elevation of the comb is:

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of the comb. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find the difference in elevation between Oliver and the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:

\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from the two banks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the amount of money given by the first bank.
2. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
3. Add the amounts from the banks to his initial capital.

First, the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue's total capital now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cats**: There were 50 cats on the rock.

2. **Cats carried away by boats**: Four boats came and each carried away 5 cats.
   \[
   4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cats}
   \]
   So, the number of cats left after the boats carried some away is:
   \[
   50 - 20 = 30 \text{ cats}
   \]

3. **Cats that ran after a mouse**: Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats}
   \]
   So, the number of cats left on the rock is:
   \[
   30 - 18 = 12 \text{ cats}
   \]

Therefore, the final number of cats left on the rock is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months) at $14 per month:**
   \[
   10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs from each period:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$140 = \$284
\]

Thus, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{284}

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). We know \( T = 28 \) and \( J = 22 \).

The savings from the jogger jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price. Let the sale price of the jogger jeans be \( J_s \) and the sale price of the tattered jeans be \( T_s \). The savings from the jogger jeans is:
\[ J - J_s \]
The savings from the tattered jeans is:
\[ T - T_s \]

According to the problem, Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
And the savings from the tattered jeans is:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

So, the sale price of the jogger jeans is:
\[ J_s = J - 2 = 22 - 2 = 20 \]
And the sale price of the tattered jeans is:
\[ T_s = T - 4 = 28 - 4 = 24 \]

The problem asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original price of the jogger jeans is $22, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28. Therefore, the difference in their original prices is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

Thus, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is \(\boxed{570}\)."
"To determine how many birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bird feeders:**
   Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others.
   \[
   3 + 3 = 6 \text{ bird feeders}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:**
   - Store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each.
   - Lillian's homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones.
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30 \text{ birds per homemade feeder}
   \]

3. **Assume the distribution of feeders:**
   Since the problem does not specify the exact number of each type of feeder, we assume an equal distribution for simplicity. Therefore, there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders.

4. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:**
   \[
   3 \text{ feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds}

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see \(\boxed{150}\) birds in her garden each day."
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel:**
   The bagel costs $4.

2. **Cost of the soup:**
   The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. First, we calculate 25% of the bagel's cost:
   \[
   0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5

Thus, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the ticket:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the ticket} = \$100
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of money Kenny has after buying the ticket:**
   \[
   \text{Money left after buying the ticket} = \$50
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny made from selling the cards:**
   \[
   \text{Total money made} = \text{Cost of the ticket} + \text{Money left} = \$100 + \$50 = \$150
   \]

4. **Determine the price per card:**
   \[
   \text{Price per card} = \$1.5
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of cards Kenny sold:**
   \[
   \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Price per card}} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100
   \]

6. **Understand that Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and sells the rest:**
   \[
   \text{Number of cards kept} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total number of cards}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of cards sold} = \text{Total number of cards} - \text{Number of cards kept}
   \]

7. **Set up the equation using the number of cards sold:**
   \[
   100 = \text{Total number of cards} - \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total number of cards}
   \]

8. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   100 = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total number of cards}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of hotdogs prepared:**
   - The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - These 18 guests each get 2 hotdogs, so the caterer prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for the first round.

2. **Calculate the total number of guests and their hotdog requirements:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed for a second hotdog for all guests is \( 40 \times 1 = 40 \) hotdogs (since each guest wants one more hotdog).

3. **Determine the shortfall in hotdogs:**
   - The caterer prepared 36 hotdogs initially.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed for the second round is 40.
   - The shortfall in hotdogs is \( 40 - 36 = 4 \) hotdogs.

4. **Calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog:**
   - Since 4 hotdogs are short, 4 guests will not get a second hotdog.

Thus, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' name. Indras has 6 letters in her name.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. According to the problem, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. We start by calculating half of the letters in Indras' name:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Now, we add 4 to this result to find the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

So, her sister's name has 7 letters.

To find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

Thus, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[
\boxed{13}

120 + 20 + 25 = 165
\]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[
0.80 \times 165 = 132
\]

Therefore, the final amount for Charlotte's order is:
\[
\boxed{132}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- Money saved: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs to buy the items:

Amount needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Amount needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
\]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
\]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much gasoline each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed in gallons. Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container holds:

\[ 3 \text{ gallons} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons to pints. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. Therefore, \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of money George had left after buying the chips:**
   - George spent $5 in total.
   - He had 1% of his money left after buying the chips.
   - Therefore, 99% of his money was spent on the chips and candy bars.

2. **Calculate 1% of $5:**
   \[
   1\% \text{ of } 5 = \frac{1}{100} \times 5 = 0.05 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate 99% of $5:**
   \[
   99\% \text{ of } 5 = \frac{99}{100} \times 5 = 4.95 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine the cost of the 3 bags of chips:**
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, which is $0.40.
   - Therefore, the cost of 3 bags of chips is:
   \[
   3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the amount of money spent on candy bars:**
   - The total amount spent on chips and candy bars is $4.95.
   - The amount spent on chips is $1.20.
   - Therefore, the amount spent on candy bars is:
   \[
   4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Determine the number of candy bars George bought:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75.
   - Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:
   \[
   \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5
   \]

So, George bought \(\boxed{5}\) candy bars."
"First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray originally had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Next, we need to divide these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide 20 by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of Ray's friends received \(\boxed{5}\) lollipops."
"First, we determine the weight of each piece of cake. Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces, the weight of each piece is:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece}
\]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so they together have:

\[
2.5 \text{ ounces} + 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces}
\]

The total weight of the cake initially was 20 ounces. After Rory and her mom each take a piece, the remaining weight of the cake is:

\[
20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the weight of the remaining cake is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"First, let's determine the total amount of onions Antoine needs. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he needs:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for 4 pounds is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to get to the theater first, we need to calculate the total travel time for both Wayne and Bernadette and then account for the 5-minute difference Bernadette wants to maintain.

1. **Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne's travel time to the theater is given as 4 minutes.

2. **Bernadette's travel time:**
   - Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time = \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.

3. **Difference in travel time:**
   - The difference in travel time between Bernadette and Wayne is \(16 - 4 = 12\) minutes.

4. **Adjusting for the 5-minute head start:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - Therefore, Bernadette needs to leave 12 + 5 = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

Thus, Bernadette should leave \(\boxed{17}\) minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first."
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the length from yards to feet:**
   - Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
     \[
     3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the width of the room:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. So, we can solve for the width:
     \[
     360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width}
     \]
     \[
     \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the room:**
   - The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, the perimeter of the room is \(\boxed{98}\) feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, we can calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought as follows:

\[
1 \text{ pack of red beads} + 2 \text{ packs of clear beads} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Similarly, we can calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought as follows:

\[
3 \text{ packs of blue beads} + 4 \text{ packs of red beads} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth. We do this by subtracting the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:

\[
140 - 60 = 80
\]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{80}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the final temperature of the house.

1. **Initial Temperature:**
   The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Baking:**
   Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   \[
   \text{Temperature increase} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial temperature:
   \[
   \text{Temperature after baking} = 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Temperature Decrease from Opening the Window:**
   Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   \[
   \text{Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 3 \text{ intervals}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Temperature decrease} = 3 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
   \[
   \text{Final temperature} = 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Thus, the final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. Therefore, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. Therefore, the time James took for the bike ride is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. According to the problem, Jon won by 10 minutes, so the total time for James is 10 minutes more than Jon's time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. The horse eats \(\frac{1}{2}\) a bail of hay per mile, so for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail per mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost of the hay is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars per bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

The change Michael receives after buying the hay is:
\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{dollars} - 24 \, \text{dollars} = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog can be made with 50 eggs, given that each glass requires 5 eggs. We divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass: \(50 \div 5 = 10\) glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, we need to determine how many trays can be filled with 10 glasses. We divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold: \(10 \div 5 = 2\) trays.

Therefore, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is \(\boxed{2}\)."

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's new totals to determine by how many points Joey is winning.

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

So, Joey is now winning by \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per sneaker:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of sneakers}} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from the flash sale:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} \times \text{Price per sneaker at flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} = \text{Total number of sneakers} - \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} = 48 - 17 = 31
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} \times \text{Price per sneaker to department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from flash sale} + \text{Revenue from department store} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 576 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate the profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

If you buy the super ticket for $20 and get one popcorn with a soda for $1 extra, the total cost is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

If you buy a regular movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price, the total cost is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \text{ dollars} \]

According to the problem, you ended up saving $2 by not buying the super ticket. Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket and popcorn and soda is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket:
\[ 15 + P = 21 - 2 \]
\[ 15 + P = 19 \]

To find the regular price of the popcorn, we solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 19 - 15 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, we need to determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can find the cost per balloon by dividing the total cost by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Bentley wants to fill 170 balloons at the new price. To find the total cost for 170 balloons, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = 170 \times 60 + 170 \times 5
\]

Calculating each term separately:

\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]
\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]

Adding these results together:

\[
10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

Thus, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then use the formula for average speed:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]

First, calculate the distance traveled at each speed:

1. For the first part of the trip:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. For the second part of the trip:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Next, add the distances to find the total distance:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
\]

Now, add the times to find the total time:
\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
\]

Finally, calculate the average speed:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
\]

The car's average speed during the trip is \(\boxed{50}\) mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she will have:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of her 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[
\boxed{6400}

3. Add the two amounts together to get the total number of apples eaten by both in 30 days.

First, let's calculate the number of apples Marin eats in 30 days:
\[ \text{Apples eaten by Marin in 30 days} = 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of apples Nancy eats in 30 days:
\[ \text{Apples eaten by Nancy in 30 days} = 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we add the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:
\[ \text{Total apples eaten in 30 days} = 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

Therefore, the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of one raised bed:**
   Each raised bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall.
   \[
   \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total volume of all 10 raised beds:**
   \[
   \text{Total volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of bags of potting soil needed:**
   Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags}

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow cards. The problem states that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we sum the number of red, green, and yellow cards to find the total number of cards:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

Thus, the total number of cards is:

\[ \boxed{78} \]"

   - Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots.
   - Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.
   - Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7.

3. **Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:**
   - The percentage is given by the formula: \(\left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100\).
   - Substituting the values, we get: \(\left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100\).

4. **Perform the division and multiplication:**
   - \(\frac{7}{20} = 0.35\).
   - \(0.35 \times 100 = 35\).

Therefore, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = \( 42 \times 75 = 3150 \) pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = \( 20 \times 65 = 1300 \) pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - The farmer buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
\[
3150 \text{ (hay)} + 1300 \text{ (oats)} + 48 \text{ (carrots)} + 2 \text{ (sugar cubes)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation.

- The length of the shark is 10 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the shark's length in inches is:
  \[
  10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
  \[
  2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches}
  \]

Next, we need to find what percentage the combined length of the remoras is of the shark's body length. The formula to find the percentage is:
\[
\left( \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \right) \times 100
\]
Here, the ""part"" is the combined length of the remoras (12 inches), and the ""whole"" is the length of the shark (120 inches). So we have:
\[
\left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\%

"To determine how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (the number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (the number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (the number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)
- The total number of kids in the class is 32.

First, we need to find the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:

\[
|D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P|
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
|D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic to either or both from the total number of kids in the class:

Therefore, they need to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. According to the problem, Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. Since Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. The maximum capacity of each player is 100 songs. Therefore, the number of additional songs Gabriel can add is:

\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

And the number of additional songs Luri can add is:

\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of additional songs Luri can add from the number of additional songs Gabriel can add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Thus, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his. The final answer is:

"First, we need to determine how much more money the child needs to save to buy the toy car. The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining $8 if he saves $2 each day. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child \(\boxed{4}\) days to save the remaining amount of money."
"To determine how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the trays, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total capacity of the trays.
2. Subtract the total number of eggs from the total capacity of the trays to find out how many eggs won't be placed.

First, we calculate the total capacity of the trays. Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays:
\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we subtract the total number of eggs from the total capacity of the trays to find out how many eggs won't be placed:
\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the trays is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

3. Add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

First, the cost of the small pizza is given as $8.

Next, the cost of the family-size pizza is 3 times the cost of the small pizza. Therefore, we calculate the cost of the family-size pizza as follows:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:
\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Thus, the total amount Sally spends is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"To determine the cost per razor after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Therefore, 2 packs cost \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.

2. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale:**
   - Since the sale is ""buy one get one free,"" Heather only needs to pay for 1 pack to get 2 packs.
   - So, the cost for 2 packs after the sale is $4.00 (the cost of 1 pack).

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon from the $4.00 cost.
   - The cost after the coupon is \(4 - 2 = 2\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total number of razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Therefore, 2 packs contain \(2 \times 4 = 8\) razors.

5. **Calculate the cost per razor:**
   - The total cost after all discounts is $2.00.
   - The total number of razors is 8.
   - The cost per razor is \(\frac{2}{8} = 0.25\) dollars.

6. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, 0.25 dollars = \(0.25 \times 100 = 25\) cents.

Thus, the cost per individual razor, in cents, after the discount is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to identify the height of the shortest cheerleader, as she will be at the top of the pyramid. According to the problem, 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. Therefore, the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The height of the human pyramid is simply the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches. To convert this height into feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches. Thus, we divide 60 inches by 12:

\[
\frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the height of the human pyramid is \(\boxed{5}\) feet."

"To determine Angela's current age, let's break down the information given:

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Since Brett's current age is 14, three times this age is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

Therefore, Angela is currently \(\boxed{38}\) years old."
"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the cost for both the morning and afternoon rides and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning each day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives 14 mornings.

\[
\text{Total cost for morning rides} = 14 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ dollars/day} = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon each day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives 14 afternoons.

\[
\text{Total cost for afternoon rides} = 14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ dollars/day} = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the total costs for both morning and afternoon rides:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 84 \text{ dollars} + 28 \text{ dollars} = 112 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:

"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:
\[
5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:
\[
50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges}
\]

Now, we find the total number of oranges both Brianne and Ashley brought together:
\[
50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges}
\]

To determine how many greek orange pies they can make, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges required for one pie. Each pie needs 3 oranges:
\[
\frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( n \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25n \)

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

To solve for \( n \), we first isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[
200 = 25n - 5n
\]
\[
200 = 20n
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[
n = \frac{200}{20}
\]
\[
n = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Lily as \( L \), and by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together, they collected 43 insects: \( L + D + B = 43 \).
2. Lily found 7 more than David: \( L = D + 7 \).
3. David found half of what Bodhi found: \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) or equivalently \( B = 2D \).

We can substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation. From \( L = D + 7 \) and \( B = 2D \), we substitute these into \( L + D + B = 43 \):

\[
(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
4D + 7 = 43
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[
4D = 36
\]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[
D = 9
\]

Now that we know \( D = 9 \), we can find \( L \) and \( B \):

\[
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]
\[
B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

So, the number of insects Lily found is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, the amount of yarn Mariah used is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. The amount of yarn her grandma used is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

Therefore, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:
\[

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Given that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, we can calculate the width of the rug as follows:

\[
\text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. We already know the width of the rug is 8 feet, so we can calculate twice the width of the rug:

\[
2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we add 2 feet to this value to find the length of the couch:

\[
\text{Length of the couch} = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the length of the couch is:

\[
\boxed{18}

"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, consisting of two packs of strawberry gum, one pack of grape gum, and one pack of green apple gum. The cost of the grape gum is $2, and the cost of the green apple gum is half the cost of the grape gum, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost of the gum is given as $7. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:

\[
2x + 2 + 1 = 7
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[
2x + 3 = 7
\]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[
2x = 4

\[
x = 2
\]

Thus, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood. The 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks, while the 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood}
\]
If he buys 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood, he will get:
\[
6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces of 2 x 8 wood}
\]
If he buys 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he will get:
\[
4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Comparing the two options, buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood gives him more sticks (1600 sticks) than buying 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood (1200 sticks). Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is:
\[
\boxed{1600}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of legs among Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, the total number of legs is:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$4.40 \text{ per day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$4.40 \text{ per day} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Next, we compare this cost to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20.00. The savings from buying the weekly bus pass is the difference between the cost without the pass and the cost with the pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to verify the number of cows in the zoo based on the information that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo would have:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to verify the number of sheep on the farm based on the information that the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm would have:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo. The farm has:
\[ 30 \text{ cows} + 10 \text{ sheep} = 40 \text{ animals} \]
The zoo has:
\[ 60 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ sheep} = 80 \text{ animals} \]

Adding the total number of animals from both the farm and the zoo, we get:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

Thus, the total number of animals is:
\[
\boxed{120}

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by analyzing the information given:

1. Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
2. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( O \) and the number of potatoes she bought as \( P \).

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Therefore, we can write the following equations based on the information provided:

\[
4O = 12 \quad \text{(number of onions)}
\]
\[
4P = 4 \quad \text{(number of potatoes)}
\]

Next, we solve these equations for \( O \) and \( P \):

\[
O = \frac{12}{4} = 3
\]
\[
P = \frac{4}{4} = 1
\]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these quantities together:

\[
3 + 1 = 4
\]

Thus, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:

\[
\boxed{4}

   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal:**
   Today is December 31st, and his birthday is July 19th. We need to count the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

   - From December 31st to December 31st: 0 days
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July up to July 19th: 19 days

   Adding these together:
   \[
   0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total number of calories by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day}

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is \(\boxed{90000}\)."

5. **Socks**: Each pair of socks requires 2 skeins.

First, we sum the skeins needed for one set of winter wear:
\[
2 \text{ (hat)} + 4 \text{ (scarf)} + 12 \text{ (sweater)} + 1 \text{ (mittens)} + 2 \text{ (socks)} = 21 \text{ skeins}
\]

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, we multiply the total number of skeins needed for one set by 3:
\[
21 \text{ skeins/set} \times 3 \text{ sets} = 63 \text{ skeins}
\]

Thus, the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs to buy is:
\[
\boxed{63}

"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

1. **Tony**: Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
2. **Bobby**: Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony. Therefore, Bobby can pick:
   \[
   6 - 1 = 5 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]
3. **Kathy**: Kathy can pick twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby. Therefore, Kathy can pick:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]
4. **Ricky**: Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy. Therefore, Ricky can pick:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]

Next, we sum the number of quarts each person can pick per hour to find the total:

\[
6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29 \text{ quarts per hour}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is:

"To determine how many loaves of bread the bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery had left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of loaves baked.
2. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning.
3. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.
4. Add the number of loaves returned by the grocery store.

Let's go through the calculations step by step:

1. The total number of loaves baked is 200.
2. The number of loaves sold in the morning is 93. So, the number of loaves left after the morning sales is:
   \[
   200 - 93 = 107
   \]
3. The number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 39. So, the number of loaves left after the afternoon sales is:
   \[
   107 - 39 = 68
   \]
4. The grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. So, the number of loaves left after adding the returned loaves is:
   \[
   68 + 6 = 74
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread they had left is \(\boxed{74}\)."
"To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum these values.

First, we calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in each row.
- Therefore, the number of rows of red tulips is:
  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ red tulips/row}} = 6 \text{ rows}
  \]

Next, we calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in each row.
- Therefore, the number of rows of blue tulips is:
  \[
  \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ blue tulips/row}} = 3 \text{ rows}
  \]

Finally, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
\[
6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows}
\]

Thus, the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant is:

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

1. **Current Daily Consumption:**
   \[
   12 \text{ kilowatts per hour}
   \]

2. **Current Weekly Consumption:**
   \[
   12 \text{ kilowatts per hour} \times 24 \text{ hours per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 12 \times 24 \times 7 = 2016 \text{ kilowatts per week}
   \]

3. **Current Weekly Cost:**
   \[
   2016 \text{ kilowatts} \times \$1.50 \text{ per kilowatt} = 2016 \times 1.50 = \$3024
   \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

4. **New Daily Consumption:**
   \[
   12 \text{ kilowatts per hour} + 2 \text{ kilowatts per hour} = 14 \text{ kilowatts per hour}
   \]

5. **New Weekly Consumption:**
   \[
   14 \text{ kilowatts per hour} \times 24 \text{ hours per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 14 \times 24 \times 7 = 2352 \text{ kilowatts per week}
   \]

6. **New Weekly Cost:**
   \[
   2352 \text{ kilowatts} \times \$1.50 \text{ per kilowatt} = 2352 \times 1.50 = \$3528
   \]

Finally, let's find the difference between the two weekly costs.

7. **Difference in Weekly Cost:**
   \[
   \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days for half a house means 10 days for a whole house).

The rate of one person painting a house is therefore \( \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \).

Now, if 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be 5 times the rate of one person. So, the combined rate of 5 people is \( \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \).

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. To find out how many hours it would take, we need to convert days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days is equal to \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \) hours.

Therefore, the number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"Let's start by defining the variables and using the information given in the problem.

1. Let \( O_s \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has.
2. Let \( O_c \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has.
3. Let \( J_s \) be the number of sofas Jenna has.
4. Let \( J_c \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( O_s = 20 \).
- Ophelia and Jenna each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( O_s = O_c - 2 \) and \( J_s = J_c - 2 \).
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( J_c = 3O_c \).

First, we can find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[ O_s = O_c - 2 \]
\[ 20 = O_c - 2 \]
\[ O_c = 22 \]

Next, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ J_c = 3O_c \]
\[ J_c = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ J_c = 66 \]

Now, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has:
\[ J_s = J_c - 2 \]
\[ J_s = 66 - 2 \]
\[ J_s = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = O_s + J_s = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = O_c + J_c = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final answer is:
\[

"First, let's determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Cost of CD} = 48 - 4 = 44
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

\[
\text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\text{Total amount without headphone set}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} = \frac{48}{4} = 12
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

1. **Weeks with 4 hours of workout:**
   - Josh worked out for 4 hours each week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours and 6 hours.
   - He worked out for 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks and 6 hours for 1 week.
   - Therefore, the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours is \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\) weeks.
   - Total hours for these 5 weeks: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.

2. **Weeks with 5 hours of workout:**
   - He worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks.
   - Total hours for these 2 weeks: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

3. **Week with 6 hours of workout:**
   - He worked out for 6 hours for 1 week.
   - Total hours for this 1 week: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

Now, we sum up the total hours from all the weeks:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of passengers:**
   \[
   \text{Initial passengers} = 48
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - 5 times as many passengers as those who got off get on the bus.
     \[
     5 \times 8 = 40
     \]
   - Calculate the number of passengers after the first stop:
     \[
     48 - 8 + 40 = 80

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[ 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 \]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find out how many years separate Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:
\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Let the cost of one monitor be \( M \). Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the total cost for the monitors is \( 2M \).

The total cost for the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + \text{Cost of the monitors} + \text{Cost of the printer} = 2400 \]
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

To find the cost of one monitor, we solve for \( M \):

\[ 2M = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2M = 600 \]
\[ M = \frac{600}{2} \]
\[ M = 300 \]

Thus, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"To determine how many seashells each girl brought, we start by identifying the number of seashells each boy brought, which is given as 60 seashells.

Next, we need to calculate the number of seashells each girl brought. According to the problem, each girl brought an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by a boy plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Let's denote the number of seashells each boy brought as \( B \) and the number of seashells each girl brought as \( G \).

Given:
\[ B = 60 \]

The number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ G = B + 4B \]

Substituting the value of \( B \):
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

Thus, each girl brought \(\boxed{300}\) seashells."
"First, we determine how many candies George originally had. Since George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, we can set up the following equation to find the original number of candies George had:

Next, we know that Nick had twice as many candies as George originally had. Therefore, we calculate the number of candies Nick had as follows:

\[ \text{Number of candies Nick had} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Thus, the number of candies Nick has is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine Anne's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Alyana's age.
2. Use Alyana's age to find Anne's age.

\[
\text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6
\]

Next, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. Therefore, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:
\[
\text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8
\]

Thus, Anne is \(\boxed{8}\) years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is:
   \[
   50 \text{ mm} - 5 \text{ mm} = 45 \text{ mm}
   \]
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \text{ mm} = 62 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm} = 188 \text{ mm}
\]

Thus, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we start by noting that April has 30 days. Therefore, the first half of April consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the next 15 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April. Consequently, in the second half of April, he saves \( 2x \) each day.

The total savings for the first half of April is:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings for the second half of April is:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

Elvis's total savings for the month of April is the sum of his savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

Since \( x \) is the amount saved each day in the first half of April, the amount saved each day in the second half of April is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Thus, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit Verna bought.

1. **Cost of apples:**
   \[
   3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50 \text{ per apple} = 3 \times 1.50 = \$4.50
   \]

2. **Cost of oranges:**
   \[
   5 \text{ oranges} \times \$0.80 \text{ per orange} = 5 \times 0.80 = \$4.00
   \]

3. **Cost of peaches:**
   \[
   6 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.75 \text{ per peach} = 6 \times 0.75 = \$4.50

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as follows:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"To determine how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day.
2. Multiply the daily distance by the number of days he works in a week.

First, we know that Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day. Therefore, the total distance he walks in one day is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles he walks in a week. Since he works 5 days a week, we multiply the daily distance by 5:
\[ 6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ miles/week} \]

   \]

2. **Determine how many more toys Jonathan needs:**
   - Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach 400 toys.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has.
   - Therefore, \( x + 2 = 400 \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]
   \[
   x = 400 - 2
   \]
   \[
   x = 398
   \]

Thus, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The cost of five notebooks: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- The cost of two pens: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- The cost of one calculator: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- The cost of one geometry set: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount means Daniel pays 90% of the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.90 = 27.00\]

Therefore, the amount Daniel has to spend on all the items he wants to buy is:
\[
\boxed{27.00}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item Carly ordered:

1. **Hamburgers:**
   - Number of hamburgers: 5
   - Cost per hamburger: $4
   - Total cost for hamburgers: \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) dollars

2. **Potato fries:**
   - Number of packs of potato fries: 10
   - Cost per pack: $0.30
   - Total cost for potato fries: \( 10 \times 0.30 = 3 \) dollars

3. **Fruit drinks:**
   - Number of cans of fruit drinks: 5
   - Cost per can: $2
   - Total cost for fruit drinks: \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) dollars

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
20 \text{ (hamburgers)} + 3 \text{ (potato fries)} + 10 \text{ (fruit drinks)} = 33 \text{ dollars}
\]

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so we need to find the change she receives:
\[
50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the change Carly gets back is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned from her sales, we need to break down her earnings into two parts: the commission from the first $1000 in sales and the commission from the sales over $1000.

1. **Calculate the commission from the first $1000 in sales:**
   - The commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission from the first $1000 = \( 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the commission from the sales over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is \( 2500 - 1000 = 1500 \) dollars.
   - The commission rate for sales over $1000 is 10%.
   - Commission from the sales over $1000 = \( 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from the first $1000 + Commission from the sales over $1000
   - Total commission = \( 300 + 150 = 450 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Antonella earned is \(\boxed{450}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of water bottles Bill already has. He has 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. Therefore, the total number of bottles he initially has is:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles per case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of water bottles required for his 70 guests, with each guest getting 2 bottles. The total number of bottles needed is:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles per guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles required:

\[ 140 \text{ bottles needed} - 48 \text{ bottles he has} = 92 \text{ additional bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy is:

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water. Since it takes him 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, we can calculate the time it takes in warm water as follows:

\[ 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a week.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. Therefore, his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

John wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him to save this amount, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take John \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save $80."
"To determine the total cost of the lunch, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the foot-long fish sub is given as $40.
2. The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. Therefore, we calculate the cost of the cold-cut combo sub as follows:
   \[
   3 \times 40 = 120
   \]
3. Now, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost:
   \[
   40 + 120 = 160
   \]

Thus, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break the problem into smaller steps.

1. Determine the number of buttons with four holes.
   - The total number of buttons is 21.
   - The number of buttons with two holes is 7.
   - Therefore, the number of buttons with four holes is \(21 - 7 = 14\).

2. Calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with two holes.
   - Each of the 7 buttons has 2 holes.
   - So, the total number of holes from these buttons is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

3. Calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with four holes.
   - Each of the 14 buttons has 4 holes.
   - So, the total number of holes from these buttons is \(14 \times 4 = 56\).

4. Add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes.
   - The total number of holes is \(14 + 56 = 70\).

Thus, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"First, let's determine the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we calculate:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we find the size of Peter's locker, which is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker:

"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily. The daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups. Since Octavia drinks half the recommended amount, she drinks:

\[
\frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we calculate how many cups of coffee Juan drinks daily. Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so he drinks:

\[
10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

\[
20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups}
\]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \(\boxed{16}\) cups."

- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- The total number of rodents is \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Thus, the total number of rodents in the pet shop is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob based on the information given.

1. **Weight of Susan:**
   - Mark weighs 150 pounds.
   - Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.
   \[
   \text{Weight of Susan} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Weight of Bob:**
   - Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.
   \[
   \text{Weight of Bob} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Mark} + \text{Weight of Susan} + \text{Weight of Bob}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends (3):
\[
\text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle from the ground to the sun after it has moved 10 hours, given that it moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour from the tip of the pyramid.

1. **Initial Angle**: The initial angle from the ground to the sun is the same as the angle of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees.

2. **Rate of Movement**: The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

3. **Total Movement**: Over 10 hours, the sun will move:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **Final Angle**: The final angle from the ground to the sun will be the initial angle plus the total movement:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is:
\[

"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. Therefore, the age of the younger son is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs one candle per year, the total number of candles required is:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so the number of packs required is:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total amount James spends on candles is:

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. We know that she read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in the first week. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the reading rate is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \]

Using this rate, we can calculate the number of pages she read in 105 minutes:
\[ \text{Pages read in the first week} = 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} = 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, we are given that she read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we can find the total number of pages she read in two weeks by adding the pages read in the first week and the second week:
\[ \text{Total pages read in two weeks} = 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Since Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\text{Sandwiches eaten by Cody} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, we calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Since Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\text{Sandwiches eaten by Trevor} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we find the total number of sandwiches eaten by both Cody and Trevor:

\[
\text{Total sandwiches eaten} = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches to find out how many sandwiches are left:

\[
\text{Sandwiches left} = 12 - 7 = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \). According to the problem, Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so we have:
\[ S = 44 \]

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be:
\[ S + 7 = 44 + 7 = 51 \]

At that time, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, in 7 years, his nephew's age will be:
\[ N + 7 \]

We can set up the following equation based on the information given:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently \(\boxed{10}\) years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00.
   - Therefore, for three teeth, the total amount is:
     \[
     3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Since the previous three teeth each received $1.00, half of that amount is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, for two teeth, the total amount is:
     \[
     2 \times 0.50 = 1 \text{ dollar}
     \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
\boxed{9.00}

"To determine the total number of goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna, we start by using the information given in the problem.

1. **Richie's Goals:**
   Richie scored 80 goals.

2. **Mark's Goals:**
   Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can express Mark's goals as:
   \[
   \text{Mark's goals} = \text{Richie's goals} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]

3. **Anna's Goals:**
   Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can express Anna's goals as:
   \[
   \text{Anna's goals} = \text{Richie's goals} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]

4. **Total Goals:**
   To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we sum their individual goals:
   \[
   \text{Total goals} = \text{Richie's goals} + \text{Mark's goals} + \text{Anna's goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
   \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:

Therefore, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's denote the starting value of the number train as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 20 \).

The steps given in the problem can be broken down as follows:

1. Take the starting value \( x \) and add half of it.
2. Divide the result by 5.
3. Multiply the result by the starting value minus 12.

Let's go through these steps one by one.

1. Calculate half of the starting value:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

2. Add this value to the starting value:
   \[
   x + \frac{x}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

3. Divide the result by 5:
   \[
   \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

4. Multiply this result by the starting value minus 12:
   \[
   6 \times (x - 12) = 6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48
   \]

So, the final value of the number train is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]"

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. The actual temperature is 468 when Maggie sets it to 450. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the actual temperature is 4% higher than the set temperature. To find the set temperature that will result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to determine the set temperature \( x \) such that the actual temperature is 104% of \( x \):

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then sum them up.

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
   - 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes is \(60 + 30 = 90\) minutes.

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
   - 2 hours is equal to \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes is \(120 + 5 = 125\) minutes.

3. Adding the durations of both movies:
   \[
   90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is \(\boxed{215}\) minutes."
"To determine the value of Juan's house, we start by noting that Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house. This means that Juan's house costs 70% of the price of Herb's house.

First, we calculate 70% of the price of Herb's house:
\[
0.70 \times 76000 = 53200
\]
So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

Next, we find the combined value of both houses by adding the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house:
\[
76000 + 53200 = 129200
\]

Thus, the value of the two houses combined is:
\[
\boxed{129200}
\]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. Since a dozen is 12, Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Therefore, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought by Judy and her friend: \(12 + 40 = 52\)
- Total dishes brought by Judy and her friend: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

\[52 + 68 = 120\]

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per contact when buying 2 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

**Jill's Work:**
- Saturday: 2 hours

- Saturday: Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours
- Sunday: Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
- Total hours worked by John: \(4 + 3 = 7\) hours

Next, we calculate the total earnings for both John and Jill.

**Jill's Earnings:**
- Hourly rate: $10
- Total hours worked: 3 hours
- Total earnings: \(3 \times 10 = 30\) dollars

**John's Earnings:**
- Hourly rate: $10
- Total hours worked: 7 hours
- Total earnings: \(7 \times 10 = 70\) dollars

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

**Difference in Earnings:**
- John's earnings: 70 dollars
- Jill's earnings: 30 dollars
- Difference: \(70 - 30 = 40\) dollars

Thus, John earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories}\)

Next, we add the calories burned from both activities to find the total calories burned:
\[1000 \text{ calories} + 600 \text{ calories} = 1600 \text{ calories}\]

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how much water she needs to drink, we set up the following proportion:
\[
\frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{160000 \text{ ml} \cdot \text{calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = 800 \text{ ml}
\]

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink \(\boxed{800}\) ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. So, we can write the equation:
\[
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
3B = 4500
\]
Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[
B = 1500
\]
Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. The number of red jelly beans is:
\[
0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485
\]
The number of green jelly beans is:
\[
1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515
\]
To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[
1515 - 1485 = 30
\]
Thus, the number of green jelly beans is 30 more than the number of red jelly beans. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"First, let's identify the three measurements of Jared's typing speed:
1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: \(52 + 5 = 57\) WPM

Next, we calculate the average of these three measurements. The formula for the average of three numbers is:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of the numbers}}{\text{Number of measurements}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

First, we find the sum of the numbers:
\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Now, we divide the sum by the number of measurements (3):
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52

"Let's denote the smallest angle by \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the measures of the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[
\boxed{90}

"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. The speed \( v \) of the plane can be calculated using the formula:

\[ v = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed. Using the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]

we substitute the distance and speed:

\[ \text{time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional \(\boxed{5}\) hours to travel 2000 miles."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Ruiz in one hour} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we first find out how many pounds Marissa makes in two hours:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Marissa in two hours} = 120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds Marissa makes in one hour by dividing 90 by 2:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Marissa in one hour} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours. Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Ruiz in 12 hours} = 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Marissa in 12 hours} = 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts together gives the total amount of chocolates made by both Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total chocolates made} = 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

**Step 1: Calculate earnings from the first four hours.**
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- He sold lemonade for 4 hours.

First, calculate the total number of cups sold in the first four hours:
\[
15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, calculate the total earnings from these 60 cups:
\[
60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30.00
\]

**Step 2: Calculate earnings from the next two hours.**
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- He sold lemonade for 2 hours.

First, calculate the total number of cups sold in the next two hours:
\[
10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, calculate the total earnings from these 20 cups:
\[
20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12.00
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for the 6 hours.**
Add the earnings from the first four hours and the next two hours:
\[
\$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is:
\[
\boxed{42}
\]"
"To determine how many years before the tires need to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per mile for one tire:**
   \[
   \text{Rotations per mile} = 725
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month for one tire:**
   \[
   \text{Rotations per month} = 725 \times 400 = 290,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year for one tire:**
   \[
   \text{Rotations per year} = 290,000 \times 12 = 3,480,000
   \]

4. **Determine how many years it takes for one tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations:**
   \[
   \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000}{3,480,000} = 3
   \]

Therefore, the tires will need to be replaced after \(\boxed{3}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washings per pump:**
   - The jumbo bottle of shampoo gives 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.
   - Therefore, the number of washings per pump is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost per washing:**
   - The jumbo bottle costs $24.00.
   - The total number of washings is 120.
   - Therefore, the cost per washing is:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
     \]

3. **Determine the cost per pump:**
   - Since each pump provides 60 washings, the cost per pump is:
     \[
     0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \times 60 \text{ washings per pump} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
     \]

4. **Convert the cost per pump to cents:**
   - There are 100 cents in a dollar.
   - Therefore, the cost per pump in cents is:
     \[
     12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"First, let's calculate the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt originally costs $25 with a 30% discount. The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts originally cost $35. Since there is no discount mentioned for the shorts, the price remains $35.

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the outfit is $52.50, which is more than $50, Joe does not have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, the problem as stated is not feasible with the given budget. However, if we assume the problem is asking for the remaining money if Joe could somehow manage to buy the items (which he can't with the given budget), the calculation would be:
\[ 50 - 52.50 = -2.50 \]

Since Joe cannot afford the items, the practical answer is that he will be short by $2.50. But if we strictly follow the problem's request for the remaining money, the answer would be:
\[ \boxed{-2.50} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week:**

   - There are 7 days in a week.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants:**
   - It takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.
   - Juan needs to make 28 dozen croissants.
   \[
   28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make 28 dozen croissants."
"To determine how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street.
2. Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street.
3. Find the difference between the cost to repave Lewis' street and Monica's street.

First, let's calculate the cost to repave Monica's street. Monica's street is 150 meters long, and it costs $194 per meter to repave it. Therefore, the cost to repave Monica's street is:
\[
150 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 29100 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, and it costs $194 per meter to repave it. Therefore, the cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[
490 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 95060 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find the difference between the cost to repave Lewis' street and Monica's street:
\[
95060 \text{ dollars} - 29100 \text{ dollars} = 65960 \text{ dollars}
\]

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts and calculate the cost step by step.

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   John receives an initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Duration of Research:**
   The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
   \]
   Therefore, the research lasts for 50 months in total.

3. **Cost for the First 5 Months:**
   The cost for the first 5 months is given as $100,000.

4. **Cost for the Remaining 45 Months:**
   After the first 5 months, each subsequent month costs 50% more than the previous month. We need to calculate the cost for each of these 45 months.

   Let's denote the cost for the \( n \)-th month after the first 5 months as \( C_n \). The cost for the first of these 45 months (6th month) is:
   \[
   C_1 = 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000
   \]
   The cost for the second month (7th month) is:
   \[
   C_2 = 150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000
   \]
   The cost for the third month (8th month) is:
   \[
   C_3 = 225,000 \times 1.5 = 337,500
   \]
   This pattern continues, with each month's cost being 1.5 times the previous month's cost.

   The cost for the \( n \)-th month can be expressed as:
   \[
   C_n = 100,000 \times (1.5)^n
   \]

5. **Sum of the Costs for the Remaining 45 Months:**
   We need to find the sum of the costs for the 45 months starting from the 6th month. This is a geometric series with the first term \( a = 150,000 \) and common ratio \( r = 1.5 \).

   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series is given by:
   \[
   S = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}
   \]
   Here, \( n = 45 \), \( a = 150,000 \), and \( r = 1.5 \):
   \[
   S = 150,000 \frac{(1.5)^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1}
   \]
   Simplifying the denominator:
   \[
   S = 150,000 \frac{(1.5)^{45} - 1}{0.5}
   \]
   \[
   S = 300,000 \left( (1.5)^{45} - 1 \right)
   \]

6. **Calculating \( (1.5)^{45} \):**
   Using a calculator:
   \[
   (1.5)^{45} \approx 1,162,261.467
   \]

7. **Sum of the Costs for the Remaining 45 Months:**
   \[
   S \approx 300,000 \left( 1,162,261.467 - 1 \right)
   \]
   \[
   S \approx 300,000 \times 1,162,260.467
   \]
   \[
   S \approx 348,678,140.1
   \]

8. **Total Cost of Research:**
   Adding the initial 5 months' cost to the cost of the remaining 45 months:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 100,000 + 348,678,140.1
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} \approx 348,778,140.1
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is:
\[
\boxed{348,778,140.1}

"To determine the total amount of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to calculate the amount of meat each player ate and then sum these amounts.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the beef tips is:
   \[
   8 \text{ tips} \times 1 \text{ ounce per tip} = 8 \text{ ounces}
   \]
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the weight of the steak is:
   \[
   16 \text{ ounces}
   \]
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the amounts of meat consumed by the first three players:
\[
6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is:
\[
\boxed{30}

2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. With 1000 members, the total number of posts per day is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:
\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts in March is:
\[ \boxed{93000} \]"
"To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of water used per week.
2. Determine the total amount of water used per year.
3. Calculate the cost of the water used per year.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water used per week.**
Gary does laundry twice a week, and each load uses 20 gallons of water.
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 40 \text{ gallons/week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of water used per year.**

The cost of one gallon of water is $0.15.
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, the amount Gary spends on water for laundry in a year is \(\boxed{312}\)."
"To determine how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item she bought and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of the aquarium:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the aquarium} = \$10.00
   \]

2. **Cost of the rocks:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 2 bags of rocks} = 2 \times \$2.50 = \$5.00
   \]

3. **Cost of the coral:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 3 pieces of coral} = 3 \times \$2.00 = \$6.00
   \]

4. **Cost of the fish:**

   \]

5. **Cost of the fish food:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of fish food} = \$2.00
   \]

Now, we sum all these costs to find the total amount spent:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$10.00 + \$5.00 + \$6.00 + \$10.00 + \$2.00
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
\$10.00 + \$5.00 = \$15.00
\]
\[
\$15.00 + \$6.00 = \$21.00
\]
\[
\$21.00 + \$10.00 = \$31.00

"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it grew to \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

In the third week, it grew an additional 4 inches, so it became \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches tall.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day. Since he sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, the total amount of meat he sells in one day is:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the 750 kg of meat from Bill's bull. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince \(\boxed{5}\) days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. Given that there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, the total number of seats is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

After the administrators have taken their seats, the number of remaining seats is:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. Therefore, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. To find the number of seats occupied by the students, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Thus, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s:**
   - Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb/s by 1000 to get the speed in Mb/s.
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
   \]

2. **Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h:**
   - There are 3600 seconds in an hour (since \(60 \text{ seconds/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds/hour}\)).
   - Multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h.
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h}

"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each day for the remaining four days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
     \[
     6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}

"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The requirement to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. So, we need to find out how much more Adam needs to grow to reach 4 feet:

\[ \text{Height needed to grow} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the height he needs to grow from feet to inches:

\[ \text{Height needed to grow in inches} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches, given that he grows 2 inches per year:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, the number of years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars:**
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total profit:**
   The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

"To determine how many men can stay upright on the wave, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of riders who can stay upright.
2. Determine how many of those riders are women.
3. Subtract the number of women who can stay upright from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright. So, we calculate:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \]
This means 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women. So, we calculate:
\[ 0.60 \times 25 = 15 \]
This means 15 women can stay upright.

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women who can stay upright from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   \[
   3 \text{ halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ halves}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs required:**
   - 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Convert the number of eggs to dozens:**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen}
   \]

Thus, Lori will need \(\boxed{2}\) dozen eggs."

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the entire 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

First, we calculate the total number of days required to read the book:
\[
\text{Total pages} = 200
\]
\[
\text{Pages per day} = 10
\]
\[
\text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20
\]

Mike needs 20 days to read the entire book. The assignment is to be completed within 30 days. Therefore, we need to find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading:
\[
\text{Days before the deadline} = 30 - 20 = 10
\]

Thus, Mike will finish his reading \(\boxed{10}\) days before the deadline."
"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   \[
   \text{Initial cost} = \$150,000
   \]

2. **Monthly Hanger Rental Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly hanger rental} = \$5000
   \]

3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly fuel cost} = 2 \times \text{Monthly hanger rental} = 2 \times \$5000 = \$10,000
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Maintenance Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly maintenance} = \text{Monthly hanger rental} + \text{Monthly fuel cost} = \$5000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000
   \]

5. **Total Annual Maintenance Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total annual maintenance} = \text{Total monthly maintenance} \times 12 = \$15,000 \times 12 = \$180,000
   \]

6. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Initial cost} + \text{Total annual maintenance} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{330000}

"To determine the total cooking time for all the food, we need to calculate the individual cooking times for rice, beans, and pork, and then sum them up.

1. **Cooking time for rice:**
   \[
   \text{Time for rice} = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Cooking time for pork:**
   It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.
   \[
   \text{Time for pork} = \text{Time for rice} + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Cooking time for beans:**
   Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   \[
   \text{Combined time for pork and rice} = \text{Time for pork} + \text{Time for rice} = 50 + 30 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time for beans} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Combined time for pork and rice} = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total cooking time:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time for rice} + \text{Time for pork} + \text{Time for beans} = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is:
\[
\boxed{120}

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts compared to a mixture of \( \frac{1}{5} \) pound almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture:
- The cost of \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- The cost of \( \frac{1}{5} \) pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

Thus, the mixture of \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts costs \( \boxed{3} \) dollars more than the mixture of \( \frac{1}{5} \) pound almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

To verify, we can substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( G \):
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Now, let's check the number of legs:
- Sheep: \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs
- Geese: \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) legs
- Total legs: \( 60 + 10 = 70 \)

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate:

\[ 5 + 0.20 \times 5 = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Therefore, he buys 7 pounds of coffee. The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:

\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Additionally, Roger buys a donut for $2. So, the total cost for the coffee and the donut is:

\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{44}
\]"

4. Add the costs of the chips, fried chicken, and soda to find the total cost of these items:
   \[
   \$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00
   \]

5. Subtract the total cost of the chips, fried chicken, and soda from the total amount Gus spent to find the cost of the apple pie:
   \[
   \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
   \]

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is \(\boxed{7}\)."

The total number of newspapers delivered in a day is 600. The number of newspapers delivered to District A is 198, and to District C is 209. Let's denote the number of newspapers delivered to District B as \( x \).

The equation to find \( x \) is:
\[ 600 = 198 + x + 209 \]

First, we add the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C:
\[ 198 + 209 = 407 \]

Now, we subtract this sum from the total number of newspapers:
\[ x = 600 - 407 \]
\[ x = 193 \]

So, the number of newspapers delivered to District B is \(\boxed{193}\)."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of class hours:**
   - The class meets 4 times a week.
   - Each session lasts 2 hours.
   - The class runs for 6 weeks.

   \[
   \text{Total class hours} = 4 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} \times 6 \text{ weeks}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total class hours} = 4 \times 2 \times 6 = 48 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine how many recipes John learns per hour:**
   - John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time.

   \[
   \text{Number of recipes per hour} = \frac{1 \text{ recipe}}{1.5 \text{ hours}} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ recipes/hour}

Therefore, the total number of recipes John learns is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. The rest of the teachers are math teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:
\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add together the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:
\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out how much each person would have if they shared the total money equally, we divide the total money by 3:
\[
\text{Money per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, if they decided to add together their money and share it equally, each person would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."

"To determine how many good days were left in the month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of days and the given mood distribution:**
   - Total days: 30
   - Good days: 12
   - Bad days: 8
   - Neutral days: The rest

2. **Calculate the number of neutral days:**
   - Total days = Good days + Bad days + Neutral days
   - 30 = 12 + 8 + Neutral days
   - Neutral days = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10

3. **Verify the initial mood distribution:**
   - First 8 days: Good
   - Next 8 days: Bad
   - Following 8 days: Neutral
   - This accounts for 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 days, which matches the total of 30 days minus the remaining 6 days.

4. **Account for the next three days:**
   - Next 3 days: Good, Neutral, Good
   - This adds 2 more good days to the count.

5. **Update the count of good days:**

\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has \(\boxed{9}\) books."
"First, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach this height, we subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow an additional 360 inches, we divide the required growth by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to a height of 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the total number of toys James needs.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - When he returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so the number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for 24 dogs.

3. **After Buying More Toys:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - When he returns again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he still has enough toys for 21 dogs.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - Initially, James needed 12 toys.
   - Then he needed 12 more toys.
   - The total number of toys he bought is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Thus, the total number of toys James needs is \(\boxed{24}\)."

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight exceeds the maximum load by:
\[ \boxed{20 \, \text{kg}} \]"
"Let's start by defining the number of cookies each person has in terms of variables and given information.

1. Let \( K \) be the number of cookies Katarina has.
2. Let \( M \) be the number of cookies Max has.
3. Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
4. Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we know:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: \( K = M - 5 \).
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: \( M = C + 12 \).
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: \( S = M + 23 \).
- Katarina has 68 cookies: \( K = 68 \).

First, substitute \( K = 68 \) into the equation \( K = M - 5 \):
\[
68 = M - 5
\]
Solving for \( M \):
\[
M = 68 + 5 = 73
\]

Next, substitute \( M = 73 \) into the equation \( M = C + 12 \):
\[
73 = C + 12
\]
Solving for \( C \):
\[
C = 73 - 12 = 61
\]

Then, substitute \( M = 73 \) into the equation \( S = M + 23 \):
\[
S = 73 + 23 = 96
\]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: \( K = 68 \)
- Max: \( M = 73 \)

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

First, combine the terms involving \( x \):

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, isolate \( 1.5x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{80}

"To determine how long it took Chris to mow his lawn by mowing half in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we need to calculate the time taken for each half separately and then sum them up.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode. Since it takes 1 hour (60 minutes) to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode, it will take half of that time to mow half the lawn:
\[
\text{Time in turtle mode} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode, it will take half of that time to mow half the lawn:
\[
\text{Time in rabbit mode} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we add the time taken in both modes to find the total time:
\[
\text{Total time} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"

   - The price per kilo of apples is $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of apples is:
     \[
     1 \text{ kilo} \times 4 \text{ dollars/kilo} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas.
   - The price per kilo of bananas is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost of bananas is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times 2 \text{ dollars/kilo} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of oranges:**

"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of this twin would be \( x + 7 \).

The other triplet is \( x \) years old, and the other twin is also \( x + 7 \) years old. The combined ages of all four individuals are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
x + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[
4x + 14 = 44
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

\[
4x + 14 - 14 = 44 - 14
\]

\[
4x = 30
\]

\[
x = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]

So, the younger triplet is 7.5 years old. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the triplet, is:

\[
x + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5
\]

Thus, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{14.5}\)."
"First, let's convert the total time John has before he has to eat dinner into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend on his homework. He has:
- 20 minutes of math homework
- 40 minutes of reading homework
- 20 minutes of history homework

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has left for a nap:
\[ 180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes John has to nap is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that the total cost of four candies is part of the $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40. Since Manolo bought five lollipops, the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

The cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong, we calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + 20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person has saved after 10 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months in 10 years is:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of coins Rong has saved in 10 years:

\[ \text{Rong's total savings} = 20 \times 120 = 2400 \]

Similarly, we calculate the total number of coins Neil has saved in 10 years:

\[ \text{Neil's total savings} = 28 \times 120 = 3360 \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total number of coins they have after 10 years:

\[ \text{Total coins} = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the cost of the heartworm check be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the total bill can be expressed as:
\[ 40 + x \]
And the heartworm check is 60% of this total bill:
\[ x = 0.6 \times (40 + x) \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 0.6 \times (40 + x) \]
\[ x = 24 + 0.6x \]
\[ x - 0.6x = 24 \]
\[ 0.4x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, the cost of the heartworm check is $60. Now, we can find the total bill:
\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:

"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of one banana. We know that one apple costs $0.50 and one banana costs twice as much as one apple. Therefore, the cost of one banana is:
\[ 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange. We know that one orange costs three times as much as one banana. Therefore, the cost of one orange is:
\[ 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the total cost of the bananas in the crate. Since there are 5 bananas in the crate, the total cost of the bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1.00 = 5.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we find the total cost of the apples in the crate. Since there are 12 apples in the crate, the total cost of the apples is:

"To determine the total number of square feet in Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Number of red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Number of blue squares} = \text{Number of red squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Number of green squares} = \text{Number of blue squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Number of white squares} = \text{Number of green squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Next, we sum the number of all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[
\text{Total number of squares} = \text{Number of red squares} + \text{Number of blue squares} + \text{Number of green squares} + \text{Number of white squares}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares:
\[
\text{Total area} = 68 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter is:
\[

"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. According to the problem, the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[
\text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant:

\[
\text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48
\]

Now, we need to determine the total number of chairs required for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of chairs needed is:

\[
\text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57
\]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:

\[
\text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total current chairs} = 57 - 48 = 9
\]

Thus, Mia needs to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"First, let's determine the number of bucks in the field. Since 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, we calculate:

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. We know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]

So, the number of 8 point bucks is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Betty's Points (Recheck):**
   We already calculated Betty's points as 65, so this is consistent.

5. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Next, we sum up the points collected by all students:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points}
\]
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Substituting the known values for Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, we get:

  \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for both types of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream:
  \[
  50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
  \]
- For vanilla ice cream:
  \[
  12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Finally, we sum the total production of both types of ice cream:
\[
2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is:
\[
\boxed{3000}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

1. **Croissants:**
   \[
   5 \text{ croissants} \times \$3.00 \text{ per croissant} = 5 \times 3 = \$15.00
   \]

2. **Cinnamon Rolls:**
   \[
   4 \text{ cinnamon rolls} \times \$2.50 \text{ per cinnamon roll} = 4 \times 2.50 = \$10.00
   \]

3. **Mini Quiches:**
   \[
   3 \text{ mini quiches} \times \$4.00 \text{ per mini quiche} = 3 \times 4 = \$12.00
   \]

4. **Blueberry Muffins:**
   \[
   13 \text{ blueberry muffins} \times \$1.00 \text{ per blueberry muffin} = 13 \times 1 = \$13.00
   \]

Next, we sum up the costs of all the items:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount on his total purchase. To find the discount amount:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times 50 = \$5.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00
\]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's determine how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, the total number of scoops Erin can get is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy each eat in two weeks.

Two weeks consist of 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Initially, both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, the amount of candy each has left is:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Ginger} \]
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Amy} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, after two weeks, Amy has \(\boxed{14}\) more pieces of candy than Ginger."
"First, we need to determine the area that Mr. Boarden wants to cover. He wants to cover two thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom. We calculate this as follows:

\[
\text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ square feet}
\]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 square feet, the number of mosaic tiles required is:

\[
\text{Number of mosaic tiles} = 24 \times 24 = 576
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{576}

"To determine how much James saved by picking his own blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store.

First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries:
- The initial cost to go picking is $20.
- The cost per pound is $1.5.
- James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.

The cost for the blueberries themselves is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the initial cost to go picking:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries at the store:
- The cost per pound at the store is $2.5.

The total cost at the store is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, we find the difference between the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and the cost of picking them:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

Therefore, James saved:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"First, let's determine the original price of each computer. The company had $700 planned for each computer. Since the price of each computer was 10% higher than planned, the new price per computer is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{New price per computer} = 700 + 0.10 \times 700 = 700 \times 1.10 = 770 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 500 \times 770 = 385000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

\[ \boxed{385000} \]"
"To determine the total number of calories in John's omelet, we need to calculate the calories from each component and then sum them up.

1. **Eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg contains 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs: \( 6 \times 75 = 450 \) calories.

2. **Cheese:**
   - John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Cheese contains 120 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from cheese: \( 2 \times 120 = 240 \) calories.

3. **Ham:**
   - John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz.
   - Ham contains 40 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from ham: \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \) calories.

Now, we sum the calories from all components:
\[ 450 \text{ (eggs)} + 240 \text{ (cheese)} + 80 \text{ (ham)} = 770 \text{ calories} \]

Thus, the total number of calories in the omelet is:
\[

"To determine how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes of cereal bought this week.
2. Compare this to the number of boxes bought last week.
3. Find the difference between the two quantities.

First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of cereal bought this week:
- Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch.
- Castle bought 5 boxes of Fruit Loops.
- Therefore, the total number of boxes bought this week is \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we know from the problem statement that Castle bought 4 boxes of cereal last week.

Now, we find the difference between the number of boxes bought this week and last week:
- The number of boxes bought this week is 8.
- The number of boxes bought last week is 4.
- The difference is \(8 - 4 = 4\).

So, Castle bought \(\boxed{4}\) more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for each minute separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps per minute when her arms are not raised. When her arms are not raised, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. Therefore, the total number of taps per minute in this state is:
\[ 300 + 250 = 550 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Next, let's calculate the taps per minute when her arms are raised. When her arms are raised, she taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute. Therefore, the total number of taps per minute in this state is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Now, we know that Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised for 2 minutes and not raised for the remaining 3 minutes. Therefore, the total number of taps is the sum of the taps during the 3 minutes her arms are not raised and the 2 minutes her arms are raised:
\[ 3 \times 550 + 2 \times 400 \]

Calculating each part separately:
\[ 3 \times 550 = 1650 \]
\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Adding these together gives:
\[ 1650 + 800 = 2450 \]

Thus, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:
\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to compare the total cost of having the city fix it (which is $450) with the total cost of Ron fixing it himself.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself:
1. The cost of the asphalt: \(3 \text{ buckets} \times \$25 \text{ per bucket} = \$75\)
2. The fine for unauthorized road maintenance: \$120

Adding these together, the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole is:
\[
\$75 + \$120 = \$195
\]

Next, we compare this cost to the cost of having the city fix the pothole, which is \$450. The amount of money Ron saves by fixing it himself is:
\[
\$450 - \$195 = \$255
\]

Thus, the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole is \(\boxed{255}\)."
"To determine the number of chairs left in the restaurant, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of normal chairs left after some were sent for repair.
2. Calculate the number of baby chairs left after some were sent for repair.
3. Add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to get the total number of chairs left.

First, let's find out how many normal chairs are left:
- Initially, there are 170 normal chairs.
- 20 normal chairs were sent for repair.
- Therefore, the number of normal chairs left is \(170 - 20 = 150\).

Next, let's find out how many baby chairs are left:
- Initially, there are 23 baby chairs.
- 13 baby chairs were sent for repair.
- Therefore, the number of baby chairs left is \(23 - 13 = 10\).

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to get the total number of chairs left:
- The total number of chairs left is \(150 + 10 = 160\).

Thus, the number of chairs the restaurant has left is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:
\[ 5 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
Since three people ate 8 slices each, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends. Each of these two people ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
Since two people ate 9 slices each, the total number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages, and the dog can do this in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the cat's time.

\[
\text{Time for the dog} = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by the number of animals.

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for the cat} + \text{Time for the dog}}{2} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes from feet and inches to just inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes by \( x \) inches. Then we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these 16 cars is:
\[
16 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these 24 cars is:
\[
24 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars:
\[
64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[
\boxed{112}

"To determine what percent of Candy's spools are blue, we first need to find the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

1. Calculate the total number of spools:
   \[
   15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} + 40 \text{ (light green)} + 50 \text{ (dark green)} = 150 \text{ spools}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of blue spools:
   \[
   15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} = 60 \text{ blue spools}
   \]

3. Determine the percentage of blue spools:
   \[
   \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
   \]

So, the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000

2. **People who voted by midday (12:00)**:
   - By midday, \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by midday: \(\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000\)

3. **Remaining people after midday**:
   - Number of people remaining: \(5000 - 2000 = 3000\)

4. **People who voted by 16:00**:
   - By 16:00, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000\)

5. **Remaining people who had not voted by 16:00**:
   - Number of people remaining: \(3000 - 2000 = 1000\)

Thus, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is \(\boxed{1000}\)."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the number of pieces per pack.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days. Since Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum are required. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces needed by the number of pieces per pack:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need \(\boxed{8}\) packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of smores needed:**
   - **Kids:** 9 kids each want 2 smores.
     \[
     9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores}
     \]
   - **Adults:** 6 adults each want 1 smore.
     \[
     6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores}
     \]
   - **Total smores needed:**
     \[
     18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores}
     \]

2. **Determine how many smores can be made from one box of graham crackers:**
   - Each sleeve makes 8 smores.
   - There are 3 sleeves in a box.
     \[
     3 \text{ sleeves per box} \times 8 \text{ smores per sleeve} = 24 \text{ smores per box}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**
   - Since one box can make 24 smores and we need 24 smores:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ smores needed}}{24 \text{ smores per box}} = 1 \text{ box}
     \]

Thus, the number of boxes of graham crackers needed is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We do this by adding their individual ages together:

\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"To determine how much money each of Greg and his 3 younger siblings received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total amount of money found.
2. Determine the total number of people who will share the money.
3. Divide the total amount of money by the total number of people.

The total amount of money found is $20. Greg has 3 younger siblings, so the total number of people sharing the money is Greg plus his 3 siblings, which is 4 people.

Now, we divide the total amount of money by the number of people:

\[
\frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

So, each person gets $5. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's determine the weight of each book:

- Cindy's math books weigh 2 pounds each. Since the problem does not specify the number of math books, we will assume she has 1 math book for simplicity, unless otherwise stated. Therefore, the weight of the math book is 2 pounds.
- Cindy's science books weigh 2 pounds each. Similarly, we will assume she has 1 science book, so the weight of the science book is 2 pounds.
- Cindy's French book weighs 4 pounds.
- Cindy's English book weighs 3 pounds.
- Cindy's history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since the English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the books:

\[
2 \text{ (math book)} + 2 \text{ (science book)} + 4 \text{ (French book)} + 3 \text{ (English book)} + 6 \text{ (history book)}
\]

Adding these together:

\[
2 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17

Thus, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is \(\boxed{17}\) pounds."
"First, let's determine the number of votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we calculate:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we first find 50% of candidate A's votes and then add that to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{50% of candidate A's votes} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Thus, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we calculate Beck's apples as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's apples} = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, the number of apples each has changes. Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

   7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   \[
   8 \text{ small cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Next, we sum the total amount of water used:
\[
12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how many ounces he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:
\[
32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces}
\]

Therefore, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Alice and Clara have, and then find the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has.

1. **Determine the number of books Steven has:**
   - Clara has two times as many books as Steven.
   - Clara has 20 books.
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.
   - Therefore, \( 2S = 20 \).
   - Solving for \( S \):
     \[
     S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
     \]
   - Steven has 10 books.

2. **Determine the number of books Alice has:**
   - Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
   - Steven has 10 books.
   - Let \( A \) represent the number of books Alice has.
   - Therefore, \( A = 10 + 6 \).
   - Solving for \( A \):
     \[
     A = 16
     \]
   - Alice has 16 books.

3. **Determine how many more books Clara has than Alice:**
   - Clara has 20 books.
   - Alice has 16 books.
   - The difference in the number of books is:
     \[
     20 - 16 = 4
     \]

Thus, Clara has \(\boxed{4}\) more books than Alice."
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money she spent is:

\[
\boxed{98}

So, 4 birds were scared away. This means the number of birds remaining after the stone was thrown is:

\[
12 - 4 = 8
\]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:

\[
8 + 20 = 28
\]

Thus, the final number of birds in the backyard is:

\[
\boxed{28}
\]"
"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students in each class:**
   Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of girls in each class:**
   We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, we calculate 40% of 40:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of boys in each class:**
   Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the number of boys is:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24

"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred for buying the packs of magic cards. He bought 3 packs at $1800 each:

\[
3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

Next, we need to determine the total value of the cards he received. Mark received 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000. Additionally, there are 30 more cards, each worth an average of $50. The total value of these 30 cards is:

\[
30 \times 50 = 1500
\]

Adding the values of all the cards together, we get:

\[
4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
\]

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[
6500 - 5400 = 1100
\]

Thus, the profit Mark made is:

\[
\boxed{1100}

\]

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars by choosing the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find the daily savings. The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each and now buys them for $0.40 each. The difference in price per tomato is:
\[ 0.50 - 0.40 = 0.10 \text{ dollars per tomato} \]

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so the daily savings are:
\[ 500 \times 0.10 = 50 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the vendor saves in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings are:
\[ 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Carl has. We know that Sean has 56 marbles and Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Carl has as follows:

\[
\text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224
\]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. We know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Cal has as follows:

\[
\text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 2 \times 56 = 112
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined. We do this by adding the number of marbles Carl has to the number of marbles Cal has:

\[
\text{Total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336

"First, we determine how many students are in each of the six groups when fifty-four students are divided equally among them. This is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{54}{6} = 9
\]

So, each of the six groups has 9 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for each of the 12 groups if the activity requires 12 groups. Let \( x \) be the number of students per group in the 12 groups. Since the total number of students remains 54, we have:

\[
12x = 54
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5
\]

This means each of the 12 groups would need 4.5 students. However, since we cannot have half a student, we need to determine how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups of equal size from the 54 students.

We already have 6 groups, so the number of additional groups needed is:

\[
12 - 6 = 6
\]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during one week:
- During weekdays (5 days), 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends (2 days), 100 chairs are rented each day.

The total number of chairs rented in one week is:
\[ 5 \times 60 + 2 \times 100 = 300 + 200 = 500 \]

Next, we calculate the number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
\[ 4 \times 500 = 2000 \]

Since we need to find the total for two 4-week months, we multiply the number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bananas Gunther has in the end.

1. **Initial number of bananas:**
   Gunther starts with 48 bananas.
   \[
   \text{Initial bananas} = 48
   \]

2. **Arnold steals half of the bananas:**
   Arnold steals half of the 48 bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, the number of bananas left with Gunther is:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24
   \]

3. **Gunther adds 25 more bananas:**
   Gunther adds 25 bananas to the remaining 24 bananas.
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49
   \]

4. **Arnold steals 12 bananas:**
   Arnold steals 12 bananas from the 49 bananas.
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37
   \]

5. **Gunther adds 6 more bananas:**
   Gunther adds 6 more bananas to the 37 bananas.
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43
   \]

So, the final number of bananas Gunther has is:

"First, let's calculate the monthly share for each roommate:

Total monthly electricity bill = $100
Number of roommates = 4

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly electricity bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

Next, we calculate the annual share for each roommate:

Number of months in a year = 12

Annual share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * Number of months in a year
Annual share per roommate = $25 * 12
Annual share per roommate = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent.

- **Glasses**: Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, the total number of glasses is:
  \[
  8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
  \]

- **Plates**: Jeff sent 4 dozen plates. Similarly, the total number of plates is:
  \[
  4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates}
  \]

Next, we need to account for the items that were broken.

- **Broken glasses**: 10 glasses were broken.
- **Broken plates**: 6 plates were broken.

Now, we subtract the broken items from the initial amounts to find out how many glasses and plates are left.

- **Remaining glasses**:
  \[
  96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses}
  \]

- **Remaining plates**:
  \[
  48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates}
  \]

Finally, we add the remaining glasses and plates to get the total number of items Jeff has now.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers are worth 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be traded for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of a large button, so 27 small buttons are worth \(\frac{27}{3} = 9\) large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers and \(40 + 9 = 49\) large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 49 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 49 = 24.5\). Since the number of stickers must be an integer, we assume she trades 24 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 24 large stickers are worth 24 large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(49 - 24 = 25\) large stickers and \(49 + 24 = 73\) large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 25 large stickers left, and each large sticker is worth three small stickers, so 25 large stickers are worth \(25 \times 3 = 75\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 75 small stickers are worth 75 small buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(73 + 75 = 148\) large buttons and 0 small stickers.

5. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 148 large buttons.
   - The total number of buttons is 148.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{148}

   Joey played 2 matches on Monday.

2. **Matches played on Friday:**
   Joey played 1 match on Friday.

3. **Matches played on Saturday:**
   Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ matches}
   \]

Now, we sum the matches played on each day:
\[
2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \text{ matches}
\]

Thus, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is:
\[
\boxed{7}

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is given as 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into this expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order.

1. **Extra-Small (XS) Shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.
   \[
   \text{XS} = 11
   \]

2. **Small (S) Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   \[
   \text{S} = 2 \times \text{XS} = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

3. **Medium (M) Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   \[
   \text{M} = \text{S} - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18
   \]

4. **Large (L) Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   \[
   \text{L} = \frac{\text{M}}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]

5. **Extra-Large (XL) Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   \[
   \text{XL} = \text{L} + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15
   \]

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed:
\[
\text{Total} = \text{XS} + \text{S} + \text{M} + \text{L} + \text{XL} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15
\]

Calculating the total:
\[
11 + 22 = 33
\]
\[
33 + 18 = 51
\]
\[
51 + 9 = 60
\]
\[
60 + 15 = 75
\]

Thus, the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order is:
\[
\boxed{75}

"First, let's determine how many people think horse #2 will win the race. Given that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win. The total number of people is 50, so the remaining number of people is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Of these remaining 40 people, 60% think horse #7 will win. We calculate this as follows:

\[ 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people this is, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining 40 people:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

\[
70 + 45 = 115
\]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more money Jayden needs to buy the camera, we subtract the total amount of money Jayden has from the cost of the camera:

\[
200 - 115 = 85
\]

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles (since the first house needs half of what the second house needs).
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles (since the third house needs double the first house).

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles. Substituting \( x = 50 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need \(\boxed{100}\) cases of shingles."

"First, let's determine how many pears George has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pears} = 200 + (0.45 \times 200) \]

\[ \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 90 \]

\[ \text{Number of pears} = 290 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = \text{Number of bananas} + \text{Number of pears} \]

\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = 200 + 290 \]

\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = 490 \]

So, George has a total of 490 fruits."

"First, let's determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Since Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Ahmed read:

\[ \text{Number of books Ahmed read} = \frac{\text{Number of books Ezra read}}{2} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Next, we need to account for the additional books Ezra decided to read. Ezra read 150 more books, so the total number of books Ezra has read is:

\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we can find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed by adding the number of books each has read:

\[ \text{Total number of books read} = \text{Number of books Ezra read} + \text{Number of books Ahmed read} = 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Thus, the total number of books they have read altogether is:

\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To determine how much Tanya earned over the two days, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday.**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours on Monday.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns:
  \[
  5 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 75 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5:
  \[
  75 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate Tanya's earnings for Wednesday.**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours on Wednesday.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns:
  \[
  2 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Since she teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she does not earn the additional $5.

**Step 3: Sum the earnings from both days.**
- Earnings from Monday: $80
- Earnings from Wednesday: $30
- Total earnings:
  \[
  80 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Thus, Tanya earned a total of \(\boxed{110}\) dollars for these two days of teaching."

"To determine the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked separately, and then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance hiked. The family hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. The driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so half of this speed is:
\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour}
\]
Thus, the hiking speed is:
\[
25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour}
\]
The distance hiked is:
\[
1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles per hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance driven. The total time spent traveling is 6 hours, and 1.5 hours were spent hiking, so the time spent driving is:
\[
6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours}
\]
The distance driven is:
\[
4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles per hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
\]

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[
225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance to the vacation spot is:
\[
\boxed{255}

"Let's define the variables for the quantities involved:
- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of berries Ava collects.
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \)

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the expressions for \( A_e \), \( A_b \), and \( A_t \) into the score for Ava, we get:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is:

"To determine how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the total.

1. **Calculate the number of rides on the usual days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days.
   - Number of rides on usual days = \(3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}\).

2. **Calculate the number of rides on the special days:**
   - On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual time, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) rides per day.
   - Number of rides on special days = \(6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}\).

3. **Calculate the total number of rides in a week:**
   - Total rides = Rides on usual days + Rides on special days = \(15 + 12 = 27\).

Thus, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
Rearranging terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \), we get:
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]
We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:
\[ O + W = 17 \]
Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]
Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
Subtract 17 from both sides:
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
Divide both sides by -3:
\[ W = 4 \]
Now substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):
\[ O = 17 - 4 \]
\[ O = 13 \]
So, Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

She also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Carrie spent. She spent \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount spent on the quarters is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final number of people on the train is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month.
2. Determine the total value of these bottle caps.

First, we know that Damien finds 10 bottle caps each day. Over a 30-day month, the total number of bottle caps he finds is:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps} \]

Next, we know that each bottle cap is worth $0.25. Therefore, the total value of 300 bottle caps is:
\[ 300 \text{ bottle caps} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/bottle cap} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month is:
\[
\boxed{75}

"To determine how much Jamie was paid for working 11 hours on Tuesday, we need to break down her earnings into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Calculate the regular hours and their pay:**
   Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. She worked 8 regular hours.
   \[
   \text{Regular pay} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160
   \]

2. **Calculate the overtime hours and their pay:**
   Jamie worked a total of 11 hours, so the number of overtime hours is:
   \[
   11 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
   The overtime rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate. Therefore, the overtime rate is:
   \[
   1.5 \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$30/\text{hour}
   \]
   The pay for the overtime hours is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90
   \]

3. **Calculate the total pay:**
   The total pay is the sum of the regular pay and the overtime pay:
   \[
   \text{Total pay} = \$160 + \$90 = \$250
   \]

Thus, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work that day."
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of female lions.
2. Calculate the number of male lions.
3. Identify the number of lion cubs.
4. Sum the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs.

First, we know there are 12 female lions.

Next, we calculate the number of male lions. The problem states that there are half as many male lions as female lions. Therefore, the number of male lions is:
\[
\frac{12}{2} = 6
\]

We are also given that there are 14 lion cubs.

Now, we sum the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs:
\[
12 + 6 + 14 = 32
\]

Thus, the total number of lions in the enclosure is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised at 25% off.

To find the discount amount:
\[
\text{Discount} = 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[
\text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30
\]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price from the amount he paid:
\[
\text{Change} = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Mike will have left over is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.
2. Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
3. Compute the total monthly salary for all employees.
4. Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months to get the total amount paid over three months.

**Step 1: Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.**

The initial number of employees is 200. After hiring 60 new employees, the total number of employees is:
\[ 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 3: Compute the total monthly salary for all employees.**

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary for 260 employees is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months to get the total amount paid over three months.**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ \boxed{3120000} \]"
"To determine the total time Carrie's choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the time for each song and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total time for singing ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and they will sing it twice.
- Therefore, the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is:
  \[
  150 \text{ seconds/song} \times 2 \text{ songs} = 300 \text{ seconds}
  \]

Next, we calculate the time for singing ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and they will sing it once.
- Therefore, the total time for ""Jingle Bells"" is:
  \[
  240 \text{ seconds}
  \]

Now, we sum the times for both songs to find the total caroling time:
\[
300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time they will be caroling is:
\[

"First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at different points in time:

1. **Billy's starting hourly wage:**
   \[
   \text{Starting wage} = \$10 \text{ per hour}
   \]

2. **After 2 months, Billy's wage is increased by $0.50:**
   \[
   \text{Wage after 2 months} = 10 + 0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
   \]

3. **On his first anniversary, Billy's wage is increased by $1.00:**
   \[
   \text{Wage on first anniversary} = 10.50 + 1.00 = \$11.50 \text{ per hour}
   \]

Next, we calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours of work at his final wage:
\[
\text{Earnings for Billy} = 11.50 \times 20 = \$230
\]

Now, let's determine Sally's starting hourly wage:
\[
\text{Sally's starting wage} = 10 + 0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
\]

Sally works the same number of hours as Billy:
\[
\text{Earnings for Sally} = 10.50 \times 20 = \$210
\]

Finally, we find the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally:
\[
\text{Difference in earnings} = 230 - 210 = \$20
\]

Thus, Billy earns \(\boxed{20}\) dollars more than Sally."

"First, let's determine how many points Nikita scored. According to the problem, Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. Pierson scored 278 points.

To find half of Pierson's points:
\[
\frac{278}{2} = 139
\]

Next, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's points:
\[
139 + 11 = 150
\]

Now, we need to find the total points scored by both Pierson and Nikita. We add Pierson's points to Nikita's points:
\[
278 + 150 = 428
\]

Thus, the total number of points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[
\boxed{428}

"To determine the total number of trees planted at the end of the reforestation campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- Each class has 25 students.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(25 \times 40 = 1000\).
- Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is 1000.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \(3 \times 40 = 120\).
- Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is \(120 \times 2 = 240\).

Now, we sum the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers:
- The total number of trees planted is \(1000 + 240 = 1240\).

Thus, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is \(\boxed{1240}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Adding these together gives:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by \( 14 + x \):
\[ x = 0.30 (14 + x) \]

Next, distribute the 0.30 on the right side:
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy \(\boxed{6}\) stuffed goats."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks (14 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the first 2 weeks} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours she plays in the second part of her schedule. She plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week (7 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the second week} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we add the hours from both parts of her schedule to find the total hours she has played so far.

\[ \text{Total hours played} = 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours.

\[ \text{Hours still needed} = 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: \(60\) miles per hour
   - Time: \(2\) hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: \(70\) miles per hour
   - Time: \(2\) hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Determine the separation between the two cars:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: \(140\) miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: \(120\) miles
   - Separation = Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car
   \[
   \text{Separation} = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, the number of miles that will separate the two cars after 2 hours is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials before the premium is added. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. Therefore, the total cost of the materials is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials. A 30% premium means that James pays an additional 30% of $900. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original cost of the materials to find the total amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

Therefore, the total amount James paid is:

\[
\boxed{1170}

3. **Calculate the number of fifth-graders who passed:**
   The pass rate for fifth graders is twice the pass rate of fourth graders. The pass rate for fourth graders is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \text{ or } 40\%
   \]
   Therefore, the pass rate for fifth graders is:
   \[
   2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \text{ or } 80\%
   \]
   The number of fifth-graders who passed is:
   \[
   0.8 \times 400 = 320
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of students who passed:**
   \[
   340 \text{ (third-graders)} + 40 \text{ (fourth-graders)} + 320 \text{ (fifth-graders)} = 680

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:

"To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of branches climbed during the week:**
   - Felix charges $0.25 per branch.
   - He made $105 during the week.
   - Therefore, the total number of branches climbed is:
     \[
     \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Charge per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
     \]

2. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{105}{0.25} = 105 \div 0.25 = 105 \times 4 = 420
   \]
   So, Felix climbed 420 branches during the week.

3. **Calculate the average number of branches climbed per day:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the average number of branches climbed per day is:
     \[
     \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7}
     \]

4. **Perform the division:**

Thus, Felix climbed an average of \(\boxed{60}\) branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

1. **First batch of flowers:**
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. **Second batch of flowers:**
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. **Third batch of flowers:**
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. **Fourth batch of flowers:**
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Next, we sum these totals to find the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

Rose drops 1 flower from each batch. We need to determine the number of petals on these dropped flowers:
- 1 flower from the first batch: 5 petals
- 1 flower from the second batch: 6 petals
- 1 flower from the third batch: 4 petals
- 1 flower from the fourth batch: 7 petals

Summing the petals of the dropped flowers:
\[
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}
\]

Subtract the petals of the dropped flowers from the total number of petals:
\[
101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals}

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they used:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. Therefore, the total number of marshmallows that are no longer available is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After accounting for the marshmallows used and dropped, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Thus, each kid can have \(\boxed{7}\) S'mores."
"To determine how much money Jack and his friends use, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then convert that into the number of quarters used.

First, let's break down the playing times:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
- Two of Jack's friends can play for half as long as Jack, so each of them can play for \(20 / 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
- One of Jack's friends can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so this friend can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

Next, we calculate the total time each person plays in 4 hours (which is 240 minutes):
- Jack plays for 240 minutes.
- Each of the two friends who play for 10 minutes per quarter plays for 240 minutes, so each of them plays \(240 / 10 = 24\) quarters.
- The friend who plays for 30 minutes per quarter plays for 240 minutes, so this friend plays \(240 / 30 = 8\) quarters.

Now, we calculate the total number of quarters used:
- Jack plays for 240 minutes, so he uses \(240 / 20 = 12\) quarters.
- Each of the two friends who play for 10 minutes per quarter uses 24 quarters, so together they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
- The friend who plays for 30 minutes per quarter uses 8 quarters.

Adding these together, the total number of quarters used is:
\[12 + 48 + 8 = 68\]

Thus, the total amount of money used is \(\boxed{68}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients, which is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
We can divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. To do this, we need to express \( z \) in terms of \( s \) or vice versa. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can solve for \( z \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive and the total must be 10 ounces, we can substitute \( z = 5 - 2s \) back into the equation to ensure it makes sense. However, we only need to find \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can see that if we choose a value for \( s \) that makes \( z \) a positive number, the equation will hold. For example, if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This is a valid solution because all amounts are positive and the total is 10 ounces.

Thus, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats:
\[
3 \text{ goats} \times \$500 \text{ per goat} = 3 \times 500 = \$1500
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows:
\[
2 \text{ cows} \times \$1500 \text{ per cow} = 2 \times 1500 = \$3000
\]

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:
\[
\$1500 + \$3000 = \$4500
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is:
\[
\boxed{4500}

\[ 8 + 40 = 48 \]

Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. To find out how many more cupcakes he needs to buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes required:

\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

Therefore, Paul should buy \(\boxed{15}\) more cupcakes."
"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many cars Joe has initially.
2. Calculate how many cars Joe sells.
3. Calculate how many cars Joe gives away.
4. Subtract the number of cars sold and given away from Joe's initial number of cars to find out how many cars Joe remains with.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Determine how many cars Joe has initially:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   \[
   \text{Number of cars Joe has} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate how many cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   \[
   \text{Number of cars sold} = 0.20 \times 40 = 8
   \]

3. **Calculate how many cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   \[
   \text{Number of cars given away} = 2 \times 8 = 16
   \]

4. **Subtract the number of cars sold and given away from Joe's initial number of cars:**
   \[
   \text{Number of cars Joe remains with} = 40 - 8 - 16 = 16
   \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:
\[

"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the first day in hours.
2. Determine the time Sandy walked on the second day in hours.
3. Calculate the total time walked over the two days in hours.
4. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the time walked on both days to find the total time in hours:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we convert the total time from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total hours by 60:
\[ 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count**: Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. **First Break Count**: During the first break, he counted 20 more cars. Therefore, the total number of cars after the first break is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
3. **Lunch Break Count**: During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35
   \]
   Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards. The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we isolate \( P \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Then, we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick has:

\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, the number of cards Becca has is:

\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each type of egg and then sum them up.

1. **Green Eggs:**
   Cindy had 5 green eggs.

2. **Blue Eggs:**
   Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green ones. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Pink Eggs:**
   Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9
   \]

4. **Yellow Eggs:**
   Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

Thus, the total number of eggs Cindy had is:
\[

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund amount, and then find the net loss.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - The total shipping cost is the sum of the cost per pound and the cost per mile.
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**

     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = 32 \times 0.75 = \$24.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The net loss is the original cost of the book minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = \$32 - \$24 + \$3 = \$11
     \]

Thus, the amount of money Milly will lose is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"To determine how much chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the production for each of the first three weeks and then use the total monthly production to find the fourth week's production.

1. **First Week Production:**
   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

2. **Second Week Production:**
   Boris produces half as much as the first week. Therefore, the production for the second week is:
   \[
   \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week Production:**
   Boris produces three times as much as the first week. Therefore, the production for the third week is:
   \[
   3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   Adding the production from the first three weeks:
   \[
   8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Fourth Week Production:**
   The total monthly production is 50,000 bars. Therefore, the production for the fourth week is:

"To determine how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then sum these times.

1. **Time spent writing songs:**
   Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs. Over four weeks, the total time spent writing songs is:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup. First, we convert the weekly time into hours:
   \[
   15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 90 \text{ minutes/week}
   \]
   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 90 minutes to hours:
   \[
   90 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours/week}
   \]
   Over four weeks, the total time spent doing makeup is:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Time spent recording videos:**
   Britany records 18 4-minute videos each week. First, we calculate the total time spent recording videos each week:
   \[
   18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
   \]
   Converting this to hours:
   \[
   72 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1.2 \text{ hours/week}
   \]
   Over four weeks, the total time spent recording videos is:
   \[
   1.2 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4.8 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total time spent on TikTok in a month:**
   Adding up all the times:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours (writing songs)} + 6 \text{ hours (makeup)} + 4.8 \text{ hours (recording videos)} = 18.8 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks is:

"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. We know that Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. We know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

So, the amount of money Roy has is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway, given their speed relative to that of the kangaroos.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, the total distance \(D\) can be expressed as:
\[ D = 3 \times \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 18 \]
Let the speed of one kangaroo be \(v\). Then the distance \(D\) is:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Next, we need to find the speed of the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

Now, we need to find the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance \(D = 54v\). Let the time taken by the four turtles be \(t\). The distance traveled by the four turtles is:
\[ D = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} \times t = 2v \times t \]
Since the distance \(D\) is the same, we can set the two expressions for \(D\) equal to each other:
\[ 54v = 2v \times t \]
We can cancel \(v\) from both sides of the equation (assuming \(v \neq 0\)):
\[ 54 = 2t \]
Solving for \(t\), we get:
\[ t = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is \(\boxed{27}\) hours."
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we start by defining the number of dishes each person makes based on the information given.

1. **Kora's Dishes:**
   Kora made 20 dishes.
   \[
   \text{Kora's dishes} = 20
   \]

2. **Rory's Dishes:**
   Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora.
   \[
   \text{Rory's dishes} = \text{Kora's dishes} + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Jada's Dishes:**
   Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory.
   \[
   \text{Jada's dishes} = 2 \times \text{Rory's dishes} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

4. **Total Dishes:**
   To find the total number of dishes made by all three, we sum the dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora.
   \[
   \text{Total dishes} = \text{Jada's dishes} + \text{Rory's dishes} + \text{Kora's dishes} = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140

"First, let's determine the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces with his 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, with 3 cows, the total milk production is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk he needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the desired production:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many more cows are required to produce the additional 10 liters of milk:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs \(\boxed{2}\) more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day."

"To determine how much change Thea received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman.
2. Subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount of money given.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman. She gave four $20 bills, so we multiply 4 by 20:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount of money given. The hat cost $70, so we subtract 70 from 80:
\[ 80 - 70 = 10 \]

Therefore, the change Thea received is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig initially has. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he starts with:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Adding these together:

\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 180 \)."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the given information and categorize the students accordingly.

1. **Students good at math only**: 5 students
2. **Students good at English only**: 8 students
3. **Students good at both math and English**: The rest of the students

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. We know the total number of students in the class is 20.

\[
\text{Number of students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only})
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Number of students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7
\]

Next, we find the total number of students who are good at math. This includes those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

\[
\text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total students good at math} = 5 + 7 = 12
\]

Thus, the number of students good at math is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such groups can fit into the 2-hour concert duration, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group takes:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

So, the total time for one group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission. The intermission is 10 minutes. The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
\[ 120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we divide the available time by the time each group takes to find out how many groups can perform:
\[ \frac{110}{10} = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**
   \[
   P = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the annual interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original amount per year. Therefore, the annual interest rate is:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total interest over 3 years:**
   Since the interest is simple, it is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = P \times r \times t
   \]
   where \( t \) is the time in years. Here, \( t = 3 \):
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   300 \times 225 = 67500
   \]
   \[
   67500 \times 3 = 202500
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount after 3 years:**
   The total amount is the sum of the principal and the total interest:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 202500 = 202800
   \]

Thus, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[
\boxed{202800}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons, and then find the difference between these two quantities.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars:
- The total number of white shirts is 40.
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

Next, let's find the number of floral shirts with no buttons:
- The total number of floral shirts is 50.
- 20 of the floral shirts have buttons, so the number of floral shirts with no buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:
- The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30.
- The number of white shirts with no collars is 20.
- The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Thus, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 10 more than the number of white shirts with no collars. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer will use to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year:**
   James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year.
   \[
   \text{Total pairs of shoes per year} = 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year}
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount spent on shoes in a year:**
   James spends $2640 on shoes each year.

3. **Calculate the average cost per pair of shoes:**
   To find the average cost per pair, divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs of shoes.

1. **Calculate the cost of the green food:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
   - Total cost for green food = \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the red food with the discount:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
   - Each basket of red food has a $2 discount.
   - Discount per basket of red food = $2.
   - Total discount for 3 baskets of red food = \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for red food after discount = \( 3 \times 18 - 6 = 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost for green food = $75.
   - Total cost for red food = $48.

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we will calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. **First Year:**
   The town will build 12 homes.

2. **Second Year:**
   The town will build three times the number of homes built in the first year.
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ homes}
   \]

3. **Third Year:**
   The town will build double the total number of homes built in the first two years.
   First, we calculate the total number of homes built in the first two years:
   \[
   12 + 36 = 48 \text{ homes}
   \]
   Then, we double this total:
   \[
   2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ homes}
   \]

4. **Total Number of Homes Built Over Three Years:**
   We sum the homes built each year:

Thus, the total number of homes the town will have built over the next three years is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals involved:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( M = A - 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( A + M + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation:
\[ (B - 3) + (B - 3 - 2) + B + (3B - 1) = 87. \]
Simplify the equation:
\[ (B - 3) + (B - 5) + B + (3B - 1) = 87, \]
\[ B - 3 + B - 5 + B + 3B - 1 = 87, \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87. \]
Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96. \]
Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16. \]

Now, substitute \( B = 16 \) back into the expressions for \( A \) and \( M \):
\[ A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13, \]
\[ M = A - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11. \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for Mr. Jackson's class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate the total number of glue sticks as follows:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure he has enough glue sticks for all the students and has some extra glue sticks left over.

Therefore, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[
\boxed{7}

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and sum them up.

1. **Day 0 (Initial Infection):**
   - Initially, 10 people are infected.

2. **Day 1:**
   - Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
   - New infections on Day 1: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
   - Total infected after Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

3. **Day 2:**
   - Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
   - New infections on Day 2: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
   - Total infected after Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

4. **Day 3:**
   - Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
   - New infections on Day 3: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[
40 \times 20 = 800
\]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[
0.10 \times 800 = 80
\]

Subtracting this amount from Rafaela's total gives Julieta's total tips:

\[
800 - 80 = 720
\]

Now, we need to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta:

\[
800 + 720 = 1520
\]

Thus, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

\[
\boxed{1520}

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. Therefore, in a year (which has 12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge. Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Thus, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the number of banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, the total number of loaves is:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Given that Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can determine the number of silver coins she has.

Let the number of silver coins be \( S \). According to the problem, the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find the number of silver coins, we solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 \]
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 110 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins Gretchen has is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"To determine how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the first day:**
   Tobias ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces.
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
   \]
   So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

2. **Calculate the number of pieces remaining after the first day:**
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36
   \]
   So, 36 pieces remain after the first day.

3. **Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the second day:**
   Tobias ate 10 pieces on the second day.
   \[

"First, let's determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age as follows:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be 24. Since she is currently 8 years old, in \( x \) years, her age will be \( 8 + x \). We set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final answer is:

"First, let's determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means the remaining microphones that can be paired are:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be made from these 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much soup is available and how it can be distributed among Calvin, his wife, and their two children.

1. **Determine the total amount of soup:**
   - The pot can fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls.
   - Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult's bowl.
   - Therefore, the total amount of soup for the adults is \(1 + 1 = 2\) adult's bowls.

2. **Convert the total soup into child's bowls:**
   - Since 4 adult's bowls are equivalent to 8 child's bowls, 1 adult's bowl is equivalent to \( \frac{8}{4} = 2 \) child's bowls.
   - Therefore, 2 adult's bowls are equivalent to \(2 \times 2 = 4\) child's bowls.

3. **Determine the total number of child's bowls needed:**
   - Calvin and his wife will each have 1 adult's bowl, which is equivalent to 2 child's bowls each.
   - Therefore, the total number of child's bowls needed for the adults is \(2 + 2 = 4\) child's bowls.

4. **Calculate the leftover soup in child's bowls:**
   - The pot has enough soup for 8 child's bowls.
   - After the adults have their soup, the leftover soup is \(8 - 4 = 4\) child's bowls.

5. **Determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup:**
   - There are 2 children, and there are 4 child's bowls of leftover soup.
   - Therefore, each child can have \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) bowls of soup.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- William bought 5 notebooks.

\[
\text{Cost of notebooks} = 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.
- William bought 1 ballpen.

\[
\text{Cost of ballpen} = 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
\]

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount William spent is:

\[
\boxed{8.00}

"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we calculate the amount of material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 small mask is:
  \[
  \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask}
  \]
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is:
  \[
  20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
  \]

Next, we calculate the amount of material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 large mask is:
  \[
  \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask}
  \]
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is:
  \[
  8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
  \]

Finally, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks to find the total amount of material required:
\[
10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the total amount of material Jo needs is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"First, let's break down Harold's daily activities and their durations:

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: Harold works 2 hours less than he sleeps. Therefore, the time he spends working is:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. **Walking the dog**: Harold walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
\[
10 \text{ hours (sleeping)} + 8 \text{ hours (working)} + 1 \text{ hour (walking the dog)} = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[
24 \text{ hours} - 19 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine Adam's current age and then find out how old he will be in 8 years.

First, let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \). According to the problem, Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, we have:
\[ D = 60 \]

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = \frac{60}{2} \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be \(\boxed{38}\) years old in 8 years."
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

We can express the size of Farmer Smith's farm as:
\[ 2 \times 200 + 100 \]

Calculating the expression:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \]
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \]

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Next, we need to find the total number of acres for both farms combined. We add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. This can be calculated as:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. Since he completes 40 packages per hour, in 8 hours he completes:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. Therefore, his earnings for the day can be calculated by multiplying the number of packages he completes by his pay rate:

"To determine the number of yellow balloons, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let:
- \( r \) be the number of red balloons.
- \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There are 20 red balloons.

First, we can express the total number of bologna pieces thrown in terms of \( r \) and \( y \):
\[
2r + 3y = 58
\]

We also know the number of red balloons:
\[
r = 20
\]

Substitute \( r = 20 \) into the equation:
\[
2(20) + 3y = 58
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
40 + 3y = 58
\]

Subtract 40 from both sides to isolate the term with \( y \):
\[
3y = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( y \):
\[
y = 6
\]

Thus, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first need to calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in a 30-day month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he drives:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many tune-ups are required for 3000 miles, given that a tune-up is needed every 1000 miles. We do this by dividing the total miles driven by the interval at which tune-ups are needed:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Thus, Jon needs \(\boxed{3}\) tune-ups in that time."
"First, let's determine the number of hours Bruce works each day.

- On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.
- On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Wednesday is:

  \]
- On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Thursday is:
  \[
  10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Next, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Bruce works in these three days is:
\[

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then find out how much each received based on the total allowance.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of the balloons: Since 1 dozen balloons is 12 balloons and they are sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the ice cream: They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the total amount of money spent is $28 and this is the combined allowance of Julia and Nadine, and they were given the same amount of allowance, we can find out how much each received by dividing $28 by 2:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."

"To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   - Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   \[
   \text{Total lollipops sold} = 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was bought for $0.5.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

2. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
3. Calculate the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Calculate the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins.
5. Sum the total calories from both types of pastries.

First, we know that a normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll. Therefore, the calories in one mini cinnamon roll are:
\[
600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \text{ calories}
\]

Next, we know that a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin. Therefore, the calories in one mini blueberry muffin are:
\[
450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \text{ calories}

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled by the bus.**
The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. The formula to calculate distance is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]
For the bus:
\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by the car.**
The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. Using the same formula:
\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the difference in distance traveled.**
To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, the bus traveled \(\boxed{60}\) miles farther than the car."
"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we need to first calculate the total number of toys Sophie already had before adding the bouncy balls. We know the quantities of the building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:

- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

Adding these together gives us the total number of toys before the bouncy balls were added:

\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie's total number of toys after adding the bouncy balls is 62. Let \( x \) represent the number of bouncy balls. We can set up the following equation to find \( x \):

\[ 48 + x = 62 \]

To solve for \( x \), we subtract 48 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 62 - 48 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as follows:
- Let \( P \) be the age of Peter.
- Let \( p \) be the age of Paul.
- Let \( j \) be the age of Jean.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( P + p + j = 100 \)
2. \( p = j + 10 \)
3. \( P = p + j \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( p \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (j + 10) + j = 2j + 10 \]

Now we have \( P \) in terms of \( j \). We can substitute \( P \) and \( p \) in terms of \( j \) into the first equation:
\[ (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100 \]
Simplify the left side:
\[ 2j + 10 + j + 10 + j = 100 \]
\[ 4j + 20 = 100 \]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4j = 80 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ j = 20 \]

Now that we have \( j \), we can find \( p \) and \( P \):
\[ p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = p + j = 30 + 20 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of water balloons each person initially received. Maria invited 4 friends, and each friend, including Maria, received 2 water balloons at the start. Therefore, the total number of water balloons distributed initially is:

\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} + 1 \text{ balloon for Maria} = 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons given is:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

To find the total number of water balloons, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:

\[ 9 \text{ initial balloons} + 15 \text{ additional balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

Thus, the total number of water balloons the girls had is:

\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and the boxes already owned by the charity group.

- Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes, so the total number of donated boxes is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes.
- They already have 10 boxes.

Adding these together, the total number of boxes is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes.

The number of tables required is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already owns 15 tables. Therefore, the number of new tables needed is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \]

So, the number of new tables they need is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance spat by Zoey.
2. Calculate the total distance spat by Sydney.
3. Find the sum of these total distances.
4. Divide the sum by 2 to find the average.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance spat by Zoey.**

Zoey has 40 seeds and each seed is spat 10 feet.
\[
\text{Total distance spat by Zoey} = 40 \times 10 = 400 \text{ feet}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total distance spat by Sydney.**

Sydney has 35 seeds and each seed is spat 12 feet.
\[
\text{Total distance spat by Sydney} = 35 \times 12 = 420 \text{ feet}
\]

**Step 3: Find the sum of these total distances.**

\[
\text{Sum of total distances} = 400 + 420 = 820 \text{ feet}
\]

**Step 4: Divide the sum by 2 to find the average.**

\[
\text{Average total distance spat} = \frac{820}{2} = 410 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the average total distance spat is \(\boxed{410}\) feet."

Therefore, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's determine the total duration of Cameron's stay. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This means he stays from 5 pm to 10 am, which is 17 hours.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For every hour after the 12-hour mark, there is an additional charge of 70 pesos. Since Cameron stays for 17 hours, the number of additional hours is \(17 - 12 = 5\) hours.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is \(5 \times 70 = 350\) pesos. Therefore, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
\[1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos}\]

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, the cost would have been 1600 pesos. The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
\[1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos}\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the hay requirement for each sheep:**
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds.
   - Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds.

2. **Calculate the total hay needed for the goats:**
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds.
   - Total hay for goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

3. **Calculate the total hay needed for the sheep:**
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Each sheep needs 7 pounds.
   - Total hay for sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

4. **Calculate the total hay needed for all the livestock:**
   - Total hay for goats is 75 pounds.
   - Total hay for sheep is 84 pounds.
   - Total hay needed is \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of hay Nate needs is \(\boxed{159}\) pounds."
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so after the deposit, he has:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the pencils, the remaining money John has is:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"To determine the total charge for the job, we need to consider the fixed visit charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Fixed Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: The labor rate is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours).
   \[
   \text{Labor Charge} = 3 \times 35 = 105 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total charge:
\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Fixed Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Cost} = 40 + 105 + 60 = 205
\]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. The amount he was out initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling 5 of the CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To determine how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn \(\boxed{34}\) dollars."
"To determine the total time James took to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum initially} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   James swims at half the initial speed.
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   Add the time taken to swim the initial distance, the rest time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is \(\boxed{17}\) hours."

"To determine Cayley's total commission, we need to calculate the commission from each type of newspaper separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies of the New York Times.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 10\% \times 5 = 0.10 \times 5 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 8\% \times 15 = 0.08 \times 15 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Since Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, we can set up the following equation to find Leo's age:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]

Substituting Marcus's age into the equation:

\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]

To find Leo's age, we solve for Leo's age by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Leo's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

So, Leo is 42 years old. 

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the three individuals is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us the following equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions for \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we know \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \):

\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The paper is stacked such that 100 pages occupy 1 inch.
   - The book is 1.5 inches thick.
   - Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page on each side.

2. **Calculate the total number of pages per inch:**
   Since 100 pages occupy 1 inch, the number of pages per inch is:
   \[
   100 \text{ pages/inch}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:**
   To find the total number of pages in 1.5 inches, we multiply the number of pages per inch by 1.5:
   \[
   100 \text{ pages/inch} \times 1.5 \text{ inches} = 150 \text{ pages}
   \]

4. **Account for both sides of the paper:**
   Since each paper is printed on both sides, each sheet of paper contributes 2 pages to the book. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
   \[
   150 \text{ pages} \times 2 = 300 \text{ pages}
   \]

Thus, the number of pages in the book is:
\[
\boxed{300}

"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he staples is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"

   - Convert 7 hours and 55 minutes to minutes: \( 7 \times 60 + 55 = 475 \) minutes.
   - Subtract the total time awake from the total time from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.: \( 475 - 243 = 232 \) minutes.

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is \(\boxed{232}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial number of occupied beds:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of initially occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \).

2. **Calculate the number of unoccupied beds initially:**
   - Total beds = 1000
   - Initially occupied beds = 200
   - Unoccupied beds initially = 1000 - 200 = 800.

3. **Calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Number of days in 2 weeks = 14.
   - Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 \(\times\) 14 = 700.

4. **Calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:**
   - Initially occupied beds = 200
   - Additional occupied beds due to admissions = 700
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900.

5. **Calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:**
   - Total beds = 1000
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 900
   - Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 1000 - 900 = 100.

**Final Answer:**
The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails, which are not to family, are to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are sent to her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Finally, we need to determine how many of these 3 remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. The problem states that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"First, let's determine Shawna's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old Shawna's father is. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"If Courtney reported 48 people in attendance and Kelly says that Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number of people (since 100% + 20% = 120%).

This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

Performing the division:
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of basketballs based on the given conditions.

Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each:
\[
J + 2J + 4J = 7J
\]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so:
\[
2J = 2
\]

Solving for \( J \):
\[
J = 1
\]

Now, we can find the number of balls carried by each boy:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls is:
\[
7J = 7 \times 1 = 7
\]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

Next, we need to find out how many holes there were at the end of the third day before filling in the two holes:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

According to the problem, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day is 10. Therefore, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \). According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey. Therefore, we can express the number of corn chips Collins received as:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of corn chips. This is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Now, let's perform the addition:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total cost of the tickets for travel. The problem states that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \). According to the problem, Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, and Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon. The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Then, divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon, we can find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:

\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, the number of Pokemon that Stan has caught is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. According to the problem, each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Northward
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we need to determine the net distance traveled southward. The bird initially travels 300 miles south and then travels 36 miles north, and finally 110 miles south.

- Net distance southward: \( 300 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \)

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

\[
\boxed{374}

"To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the total number of brownies she received and consumed.

1. **Initial Batch:**
   Greta made one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. **Office Party:**
   She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. **Surprise Party:**
   Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

4. **Total Brownies Received:**
   Adding all the brownies together:
   \[
   12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (office party)} + 48 \text{ (surprise party)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

5. **Brownies Eaten During the Party:**
   During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   \[
   1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

6. **Brownies Left Over:**
   Subtracting the brownies eaten from the total brownies received:
   \[
   66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies}

"First, let's determine the ages of each family member:

1. **Nani's age**: 8 years old.
2. **Nani's brother's age**: Since Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, we calculate:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. **Nani's sister's age**: Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age:
   \[
   0.25 \times 8 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]
   Therefore, Nani's sister is:
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old}
   \]

Next, we sum the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
\[
8 + 16 + 6 = 30

"To determine the total cost of the phones, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of phones:**
   - John buys phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife.
   - Total number of phones = 1 (John) + 2 (kids) + 1 (wife) = 4 phones.

2. **Determine the price of each phone:**
   - The price of the first two phones is $600 each.
   - Each phone after the first two is half price, so the price of each of the remaining two phones is $600 / 2 = $300.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of the first two phones = 2 * $600 = $1200.
   - Cost of the remaining two phones = 2 * $300 = $600.
   - Total cost = $1200 + $600 = $1800.

Thus, the total amount John paid for the phones is \(\boxed{1800}\)."

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wood slats required is:

\[ \text{Total number of slats} = 2 \times \text{perimeter} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{100}

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister. Since she gave 2 boxes to each:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes (to mom)} + 2 \text{ boxes (to sister)} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining boxes. Calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 8 boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes she kept from the remaining boxes to find out how many boxes she sold:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 2 \text{ boxes} = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box contains 20 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 6 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Thus, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:

"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{x}{2} + 4
\]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[
x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right)
\]

To simplify this expression, we combine like terms:
\[
x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4
\]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the expression, we get:
\[
\frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79
\]

Thus, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[
\boxed{79}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost of the books:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs $25 more to afford the books. Since he earns $5 per hour, we need to determine how many hours he must work to earn $25. We do this by dividing the amount of money he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work \(\boxed{5}\) hours to afford the books."

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother, and then find the sum of these ages.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - He will turn 24 in \(24 - 19 = 5\) years.

2. **Determine the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Let \(D\) be the current age of Emil's dad.
   - In 5 years, Emil's dad will be \(D + 5\) years old.
   - According to the problem, \(24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)\).

3. **Solve for \(D\):**
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   48 = D + 5
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   D = 43
   \]
   So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

4. **Determine the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Let \(B\) be the current age of Emil's brother.
   - In 5 years, Emil's brother will be \(B + 5\) years old.
   - According to the problem, \(24 = 2(B + 5)\).

5. **Solve for \(B\):**
   \[
   24 = 2(B + 5)
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   12 = B + 5
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   B = 7
   \]
   So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

6. **Find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:**
   \[
   43 + 7 = 50
   \]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."

3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

Now, we need to find the total number of beads Adrianne has. We do this by adding the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend:

\[
20 \text{ (from mother)} + 30 \text{ (from sister)} + 40 \text{ (from friend)} = 90
\]

So, the total number of beads Adrianne has is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days:
\[ 3 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} + 6 \text{ (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we determine the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class of 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate 25% of 24:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, we determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:
\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes of their boots and then dividing by 2:
\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Thus, the average size of the shoe worn by the two is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how much money Pat will spend to fill her flower bed with plants, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the plants and the spacing to the same unit:**
   - Each plant grows 12 inches wide. Convert this to feet: 
     \[
     12 \text{ inches} = \frac{12}{12} \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot}
     \]
   - The spacing between each plant is 1.5 feet.

2. **Calculate the total space required for one plant and the space between it and the next plant:**
   - Space for one plant and the space between it and the next plant:
     \[
     1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long. Divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for one plant and the space between it and the next plant:
     \[
     \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants}
     \]
   - Since Pat can only have whole plants, we take the integer part:
     \[
     44 \text{ plants}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants needed:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants. Subtract the number of plants she already has from the total number of plants needed:
     \[
     44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6. Multiply the number of additional plants by the cost per plant:
     \[
     27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

"First, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day. Since Edgar's brother eats \(\frac{1}{2}\) as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of pretzels he eats per day by 7:

\[
\text{Number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63
\]

Thus, Edgar's brother eats \(\boxed{63}\) pretzels in a week."
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of petunias needed.
2. Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed.
3. Determine the cost of the petunias.
4. Determine the cost of the sweet potato vines.
5. Add the costs together to find the total amount spent.

First, let's find the total number of petunias needed. Since each basket requires 3 petunias and there are 5 baskets:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias} \]

Next, let's find the total number of sweet potato vines needed. Since each basket requires 2 sweet potato vines and there are 5 baskets:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ sweet potato vines} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the petunias. Each petunia costs $3.00:
\[ 15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines. Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50:
\[ 10 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the petunias and the cost of the sweet potato vines to find the total amount spent:
\[ \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With the remaining 3 pounds of soil, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, they can plant \(\boxed{3}\) roses."
"First, let's determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for the shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12.

\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Jessica can spend $6,000.00 on shoes in a year.

Now, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00, given that each pair costs $1,000.00.

\[ \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the problem into two parts: peeling the shrimp and sautéing them.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we calculate the time required as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, we need to determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are required and the total time:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes, the total time to sauté 90 shrimp is:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to complete both tasks (peeling and sautéing) is the sum of the time for each task:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is \(\boxed{45}\) minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the final temperature of the room.

1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours.
   - It cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Subsequent Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner is then turned up to high for 4 hours.
   - It cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ degrees/hour} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **Warming Up:**
   - The air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours.
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming during this period: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

4. **Net Change in Temperature:**
   - Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Net change in temperature: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\).

Therefore, the final temperature of the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{14}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley as \( D \).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw Comet Halley for the second time:**
   - According to the problem, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3D \).

3. **Calculate the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Set up the equation for Bill's age at the second sighting:**
   - Let \( B \) be Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Therefore, the age difference between the first and second sighting is \( 3D - B = 75 \).

5. **Express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):**
   - We need to find \( B \). From the problem, we know that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, so \( D = 30 \).

6. **Substitute \( D \) into the equation:**
   - Substitute \( D = 30 \) into the equation \( 3D - B = 75 \):
     \[
     3(30) - B = 75
     \]
     \[
     90 - B = 75
     \]

7. **Solve for \( B \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( B \):
     \[
     B = 90 - 75
     \]
     \[
     B = 15
     \]

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency and count of each type of check he writes.

1. **Electric bill checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of electric bill checks per year is:
     \[
     1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

2. **Gas bill checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of gas bill checks per year is:
     \[
     1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

3. **Church checks:**
   - Buford writes two checks per month to the church.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of church checks per year is:
     \[
     2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

4. **Pest and lawn service checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per quarter to the pest and lawn service.
   - There are 4 quarters in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of pest and lawn service checks per year is:
     \[
     1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52 \text{ checks/year}
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
\boxed{52}

"To determine the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips.
   - These 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips in one day.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's flights:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of flights to France (and also to Germany, since they are split equally).

3. **Set up the equation for the total number of flights:**
   - Flights to Greece: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 \)
   - Flights to France: \( x \)
   - Flights to Germany: \( x \)

   The total number of flights is the sum of these:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 88 + x + x = 88
   \]

4. **Simplify and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 88 + 2x = 88
   \]
   \[
   66 + 2x = 88
   \]
   \[
   2x = 88 - 66
   \]
   \[
   2x = 22
   \]
   \[
   x = 11
   \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl**: Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote's howl**: Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. Therefore, Chikote's howl lasts:
   \[
   2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]
3. **Igneous's howl**: Igneous howls for as long as the combined duration of Tobias's and Chikote's howls. Therefore, Igneous's howl lasts:
   \[
   20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total duration of all three wolves' howls in seconds:
\[
20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[
\frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's determine how much money Adam received from his father. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Adam received $12 from his father. Now, we add the money given by his mother and father to find the total amount of money Adam received:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam's trousers cost $30, and he received $18 from his parents. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from the total cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. Akbar's age \( A = 3 \) years.
2. Alessandro's age \( B = 4 \) years.
3. The total age of the children is 20 years.
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age of the children as:
\[
A + B + H + W = 20
\]

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( B \):
\[
3 + 4 + H + W = 20
\]

Simplifying this equation:
\[
7 + H + W = 20
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate \( H + W \):
\[
H + W = 13
\]

Next, we use the information that Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}
\]

Substituting the total age:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Since Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[
H = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Now, substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[
10 + W = 13
\]

Subtract 10 from both sides to solve for \( W \):
\[
W = 3
\]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund:

- From his neighbors: $500
- From the online fund: $1500

Adding these amounts together gives:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. The ""everyone else"" here refers to the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

So, the lawyer's contribution is:
\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6000} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of cookies brought to the reception. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:
\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:
\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:
\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 2 \text{ (adults)} \times 2x \text{ (slices per adult)} + 4 \text{ (kids)} \times x \text{ (slices per kid)} = 4x + 4x = 8x. \]

The total size of the watermelon is represented by the sum of all the slices, which is \( 8x \). Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), so the fraction of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}. \]

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%. \]

Therefore, each adult gets \(\boxed{25\%}\) of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract this from the nine hours he has available.

First, let's calculate the time spent on inpatient rounds:
- Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients.
- Each inpatient check takes 20 minutes.

\[
9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments:
- Doctor Jones has 10 appointments.
- Each appointment takes 30 minutes.

\[
10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, let's convert the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from minutes to hours:
- 180 minutes is equivalent to:

\[
\frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

- 300 minutes is equivalent to:

\[
\frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[
3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total time spent on these activities from the nine hours available:

\[
9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

Thus, the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready by 5:00 pm, we need to add up the total time required for each step and then subtract this total from 5:00 pm.

1. **Making the cake batter:** 20 minutes
2. **Baking the cake:** 30 minutes
3. **Cooling the cake:** 2 hours (120 minutes)
4. **Frosting the cake:** 10 minutes

First, let's add up the total time required for all the steps:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert 180 minutes into hours:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm to find the latest start time:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is:

"To determine how many chocolate bars are in a box, we start by defining the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars. Peter sold 4.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Thus, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."

"To determine how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:**
   - Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars.
   - Let \( p \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes.
   - We can set up the equation: \( 4p = 64 \).
   - Solving for \( p \):
     \[
     p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
     \]
   - So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

2. **Determine the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha:**
   - Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars.
   - Let \( m \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes.
   - We can set up the equation: \( 7m = 56 \).
   - Solving for \( m \):
     \[
     m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
     \]
   - So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha:**
   - The difference is \( p - m \):
     \[
     p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
     \]

Therefore, Peter has \(\boxed{8}\) more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."

   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of male porcupines:**
   The number of male porcupines is the total population minus the number of female porcupines.
   \[
   \text{Number of male porcupines} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of porcupine babies born each month:**
   Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:
   \[
   \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of porcupine babies born in a year:**
   Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:
   \[
   \text{Number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:**
   The initial population is 50, and after a year, 1440 new porcupines are added.
   \[
   \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

Thus, the number of porcupines in the park after a year is \(\boxed{1490}\)."
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons needed.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The conversion factor is that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
\[ G = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 7.48 \, \text{gallons per cubic foot} = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per gallon} = 1047.20 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each type of stick and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks:**
   - There are 9 red sticks.

2. **Blue Sticks:**
   - The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of blue sticks is:
     \[
     9 + 5 = 14
     \]

3. **Yellow Sticks:**
   - The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is:
     \[
     14 - 3 = 11
     \]

4. **Total Number of Sticks:**
   - Sum the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:
     \[
     9 + 14 + 11 = 34
     \]

Thus, the total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge, accounting for the different rates of charge loss.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

### Step 1: Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours
The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours. Therefore, the charge remaining after 5 hours is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times (0.91)^5 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the charge after the next 3 hours
After the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for the next 3 hours. Therefore, the charge remaining after these 3 hours is:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

### Step 3: Set up the equation based on the final charge
We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( C \)
First, calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

Now, multiply these values together:
\[ 0.624032 \times 0.804357 \approx 0.5018 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ C \times 0.5018 = 0.28 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.5018} \approx 0.5578 \]

### Final Answer
The initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately \( 55.78\% \).

\[
\boxed{55.78\%}

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings:**
   - Hourly wage: $10/hour
   - Hourly tips: $15/hour
   - Total hours worked per week: 40 hours

   \[
   \text{Total weekly earnings} = (\text{Hourly wage} + \text{Hourly tips}) \times \text{Total hours worked per week}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total weekly earnings} = (10 + 15) \times 40 = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount Janet wants to save for the down payment:**
   - Cost of the car: $10,000
   - Percentage to save: 20%

   \[
   \text{Down payment} = \text{Cost of the car} \times \text{Percentage to save}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Down payment} = 10000 \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of weeks needed to save the down payment:**
   - Total weekly earnings: $1000
   - Down payment: $2000

   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total weekly earnings}}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment for the car."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased.

- The cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- The cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- The cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- The cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, we add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount of money he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, let's determine the total number of sweets Anne has. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is:
\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, Anne kept 2 packs for herself. Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces she kept is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces left to give to her friends is:
\[ 900 - 120 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:
\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces of sweets each of her friends received is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Next, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \]
\[ 1.05 \times 1.05 = 1.1025 \]
\[ 1.1025 \times 1.05 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this result by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, we get:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be \(\boxed{139}\)."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of guests:**
   The hotel starts with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkouts:**
   24 guests elected to check out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

3. **Late checkouts:**
   15 guests elected to check out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

4. **Afternoon check-ins:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests checked in}
   \]
   Adding these to the remaining guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91 \text{ guests}

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so we have:
\[ L = 3S \]
We are also given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so:
\[ S = 4 \]
Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ L = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is:
\[ x \times L = x \times 12 \]
The total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is:
\[ 2x \times S = 2x \times 4 = 8x \]
The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is given as $120, so we can write the equation:
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 20x = 120 \]
Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]
So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6, and the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is:

1. **Initial Balloons:**
   - Red balloons: 25
   - Green balloons: 7
   - Yellow balloons: 12

2. **Red Balloons Burst:**
   - 40% of the red balloons burst.
   - Number of red balloons that burst: \( 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \)
   - Remaining red balloons: \( 25 - 10 = 15 \)

3. **Yellow Balloons Released:**
   - Sally released half of the yellow balloons.
   - Number of yellow balloons released: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \)
   - Remaining yellow balloons: \( 12 - 6 = 6 \)

4. **Blue Balloons Found:**
   - Sally found 8 blue balloons.
   - She added 75% of the blue balloons to her remaining clutch.
   - Number of blue balloons added: \( 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \)
   - Total blue balloons: \( 6 \)

5. **Total Balloons Carried into School:**
   - Red balloons: 15
   - Green balloons: 7
   - Yellow balloons: 6
   - Blue balloons: 6

   Summing these up:
   \[
   15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34
   \]

Thus, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% = 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% = 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (since there's a 40% chance of an extension, the remaining probability is 100% - 40% = 60%)
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% = 0.20
   - Combined probability = 60% * 20% = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum these probabilities to find the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

\[
0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.12 + 0.90 = 0.92
\]

This means there is a 92% chance that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:

\[
100\% - 92\% = 8\%
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} + 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 1250 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

**Final Answer:**
Each graduate would receive 5 tickets."
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans and then use these relationships to find the number of small jelly beans he can consume.

1. **Determine the number of medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Since it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up, the number of medium-sized jelly beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

2. **Determine the number of small jelly beans equivalent to the medium-sized jelly beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized jelly beans is:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450
     \]

Thus, the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \(\boxed{450}\)."

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - The number of intervals between bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \) intervals.
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Determine the time to drop the candy in each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is \( 8 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \).

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \(\boxed{40}\) seconds."
"First, calculate the total number of apples Uncle Franky has by multiplying the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes:

So, Uncle Franky can make \(\boxed{10}\) packs of apples."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese that Amor buys. The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she buys 2 pounds:

\[ 11 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 2 \, \text{pounds} = 22 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the mozzarella cheese that Amor buys. The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she buys 3 pounds:

\[ 6 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 3 \, \text{pounds} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total amount spent:

\[ 22 \, \text{dollars} + 18 \, \text{dollars} = 40 \, \text{dollars} \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after her purchases, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount she started with:

\[ 50 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:

\[

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of loans:**
   Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   \[
   \text{Total loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working:**
   Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year. He did not work for 4 years.
   \[
   \text{Total income lost} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn:**
   The total amount of money Jim needs to earn is the sum of the total loans and the total income lost.
   \[
   \text{Total money needed} = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000
   \]

4. **Determine Jim's new income after earning a college degree:**
   Jim's income tripled after earning his degree. His original income was $25,000 per year.
   \[
   \text{New income} = 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000
   \]

5. **Calculate the time required to earn the total money needed:**
   To find out how long it will take Jim to earn $300,000 at his new income of $75,000 per year, we divide the total money needed by his new income.
   \[
   \text{Time required} = \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \text{ years}

Thus, it will take Jim \(\boxed{4}\) years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece. The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For one fabric piece:
\[ A = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday's Deliveries:**
   The post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Deliveries:**
   On Tuesday, the post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many letters as on Monday. First, we calculate one-fifth of Monday's deliveries:
   \[
   \frac{425}{5} = 85
   \]
   Then, we add 17 to this amount:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday's Deliveries:**
   On Wednesday, the post office delivered 5 more than twice as many letters as on Tuesday. First, we calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this amount:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

4. **Total Deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:**
   Now, we sum the deliveries from all three days:
   \[
   425 + 102 + 209 = 736
   \]

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is \(\boxed{736}\)."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average over the three races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Loss in the first race: \( L_1 = 5 \)

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Amount won in the second race: \( W_2 = 2 \times L_1 + 1 = 2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Loss in the third race: \( L_3 = 1.5 \times W_2 = 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5 \)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost and the total amount won over the three races.

- Total loss: \( L_1 + L_3 = 5 + 16.5 = 21.5 \)
- Total win: \( W_2 = 11 \)

The net loss is the total loss minus the total win:
\[ \text{Net loss} = L_1 + L_3 - W_2 = 21.5 - 11 = 10.5 \]

To find the average loss per race, we divide the net loss by the number of races (3):
\[ \text{Average loss per race} = \frac{\text{Net loss}}{3} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5 \]

Thus, the average loss per race is:
\[
\boxed{3.5}

"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America.
2. Calculate the total population by multiplying the number of cities by the number of people living in each city.

First, we know there are 26 countries in South America and each country has 5 cities. Therefore, the total number of cities in South America is:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, we know that each city has 1000 people living in it. Therefore, the total population of South America is:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

So, the total population of South America, based on the given information, is:
\[ \boxed{130000} \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches since the growth is given in inches.

1. **Xavier's height now:**
   - Xavier was originally 4 feet tall.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
   - Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer.
   - Therefore, Xavier's current height is \(48 + 3 = 51\) inches.

2. **Cole's height now:**
   - Cole was originally 50 inches tall.
   - Cole grew 2 inches over the summer.
   - Therefore, Cole's current height is \(50 + 2 = 52\) inches.

3. **Difference in height between Cole and Xavier:**
   - Cole's height now is 52 inches.
   - Xavier's height now is 51 inches.
   - The difference is \(52 - 51 = 1\) inch.

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is \(\boxed{1}\) inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

First, simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Then, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the time worked per day into hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the hours worked per day by the team is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is:
     \[
     3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - The team worked 9 hours each day for 21 days.
   - Therefore, the total hours worked by the team is:
     \[
     9 \times 21 = 189 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - Therefore, the hours worked by each painter is:
     \[
     \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, each painter put in \(\boxed{47.25}\) hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

First, combine the terms involving \( x \):
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot (2x) + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is \( x = 6 \).

To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and \( n = 3 \) years.

Let's calculate the value step by step:

1. Calculate the value after the first year:
\[ \text{Value after 1 year} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21) = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800 \]

2. Calculate the value after the second year:
\[ \text{Value after 2 years} = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12482 \]

3. Calculate the value after the third year:
\[ \text{Value after 3 years} = 12482 \times 0.79 = 9831.78 \]

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is \(\boxed{9831.78}\)."
"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of English books.
2. Calculate the number of German books.
3. Subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books.

First, we calculate the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are written in English:
\[
\text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Next, we calculate the number of German books. Since 10% of the 50 books are written in German:
\[
\text{Number of German books} = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
\]

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books:
\[
\text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of Spanish books is \(\boxed{20}\)."

First, we know that Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, the total number of cups she drinks is:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cups into gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16:
\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%.

To find the increase:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used per week:**
   - Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week.
   - Greg uses 1 king sheet per week.
   - Total sheets per week = 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sheets.

2. **Determine the number of loads needed per week:**
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time.
   - Since 4 twin sheets are used per week, it will take 2 loads to wash all the twin sheets (2 sets per load).
   - 1 king sheet is used per week, which will take 1 load.
   - Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads.

3. **Calculate the number of weeks in a year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.

4. **Calculate the total number of loads per year:**
   - Total loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads.

Thus, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday:**
   They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Calculate the number of movies watched on Sunday:**
   They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of movies watched in one weekend:**
   The total number of movies watched in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday) is:
   \[
   4 + 2 = 6
   \]

"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of stickers Leo had two years ago:**
   \[
   \text{Stickers two years ago} = 100
   \]

2. **Determine the number of stickers Leo collected last year:**
   \[
   \text{Stickers last year} = 50
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of stickers Leo collected this year:**
   \[
   \text{Stickers this year} = 2 \times \text{Stickers last year} = 2 \times 50 = 100
   \]

4. **Sum the stickers from all three years to find the total number of stickers in Leo's collection:**
   \[
   \text{Total stickers} = \text{Stickers two years ago} + \text{Stickers last year} + \text{Stickers this year}
   \]
   \[

"First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day. Since she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams each time, the daily consumption is:

\[ 60 \, \text{grams/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 120 \, \text{grams/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{120 \, \text{grams/day}} = 6 \, \text{days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for \(\boxed{6}\) days."
"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate based on the information given.

1. **Total Slices of Pizza:**
   Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas.
   \[
   4 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 32 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Becky's Slices:**
   Becky ate 10 slices.

3. **Jake's Slices:**
   Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, Jake ate:
   \[
   \text{Jake's slices} = \text{Becky's slices} - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Silvia's Slices:**
   Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia ate:
   \[
   \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times \text{Jake's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ slices}
   \]

5. **Total Slices Eaten:**
   To find the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia, we add their individual slices:
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \text{ slices}
   \]

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[
\boxed{31}
\]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( D \). We do this by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took \(\boxed{58}\) minutes."
"To determine the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to break down each component of the charges and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for the visit is:
   \[
   300 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: The cost is $4 per pill for 30 pills, so the total cost for the painkillers is:
   \[
   4 \text{ dollars/pill} \times 30 \text{ pills} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking, so the total cost for parking is:
   \[
   6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the individual costs:
\[
200 \text{ dollars} + 150 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:
\[

"First, let's determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, this means 80% of the emails do require a response.

The number of emails that require a response each day is:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. We do this by multiplying the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is:
\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many classes as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many classes as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

First, add 32 and 64:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]

Next, add 96 and 96:

\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]

Then, add 192 and 30:

\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]

Finally, add 222 and 25:

\[
222 + 25 = 247

"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left from their order.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left from their order.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of the small coupons and the cost of the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - Ten meatball sub sandwiches minus 3 is \(10 - 3 = 7\).
   - So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the number of meatballs in the initial order:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, 7 meatball sub sandwiches contain \(7 \times 4 = 28\) meatballs.

3. **Determine how many meatballs Mark ate:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - Each of these 4 sub sandwiches contains 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, Mark ate \(4 \times 4 = 16\) meatballs.

4. **Calculate the number of meatballs remaining after Mark ate:**
   - Initially, there were 28 meatballs.
   - After Mark ate 16 meatballs, the remaining meatballs are \(28 - 16 = 12\).

5. **Determine the number of additional meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches.
   - Each of these 3 sub sandwiches contains 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the additional 3 sub sandwiches contain \(3 \times 4 = 12\) meatballs.

6. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches:**
   - The remaining meatballs after Mark ate are 12.
   - The additional 3 sub sandwiches Sidney ordered contain 12 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"First, let's determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Determine the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 \times 0.5 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - Since 6 pounds is equivalent to 4 sets of 1.5 pounds (because \(6 \div 1.5 = 4\)).
   - The cost for each set of 1.5 pounds is $6.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is \(4 \times 6.00 = 24.00\).

The final cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{24.00}

"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who said they could not come. Therefore, the number of people who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests. For each additional guest beyond the first 20, the cost is $6. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the base rental fee to the cost for the additional guests gives the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Thus, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"Let's start by determining how much money Maggie and Riza each originally had.

First, we know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left. Let \( M \) be the amount of money Maggie originally had. Since she spent a quarter of her money, she has three-quarters of her money left. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{4}M = 60
\]
To find \( M \), we solve for \( M \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[
M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]
So, Maggie originally had $80.

Next, we know that Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left. Let \( R \) be the amount of money Riza originally had. Since she spent one-third of her money, she has two-thirds of her money left. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{3}R = 60
\]
To find \( R \), we solve for \( R \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[
R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]
So, Riza originally had $90.

Now, we need to determine how much money each of them has left. Maggie has $60 left, and Riza also has $60 left. Therefore, the total amount of money they have left together is:
\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]
So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which are enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of bananas by 7:
\[
\frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas per day}
\]

Now, let's calculate the number of bananas each of the first two monkeys eats per day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey:
\[
10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas per day}
\]

Next, we find the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys each day:
\[
10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas per day}
\]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys each day:
\[
45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas per day}
\]

Thus, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the cost of 15 roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to buy the roses. Therefore, she cannot make the purchase and will not receive any change. As a result, the number of quarters she leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of item sold and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the revenue from milkshakes:**
   - Terry sells 6 milkshakes.
   - Each milkshake is priced at $5.50.
   - Revenue from milkshakes = \( 6 \times 5.50 \).

\[
6 \times 5.50 = 33
\]

2. **Calculate the revenue from burger platters:**
   - Terry sells 9 burger platters.
   - Each burger platter is priced at $11.
   - Revenue from burger platters = \( 9 \times 11 \).

\[
9 \times 11 = 99

3. **Calculate the revenue from sodas:**
   - Terry sells 20 sodas.
   - Each soda is priced at $1.50.
   - Revenue from sodas = \( 20 \times 1.50 \).

\[
20 \times 1.50 = 30
\]

4. **Sum the revenues from all items:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from milkshakes + Revenue from burger platters + Revenue from sodas.

\[
33 + 99 + 30 = 162
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Terry makes is \(\boxed{162}\)."
"Let's break down the timeline step by step to determine when each train arrives and departs, and then calculate the total waiting time for Paul.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs 30 minutes after it arrives (10 + 20 = 30).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train departs.
   - The first train departs 30 minutes after it arrives, so the second train arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Departs 5 minutes after it arrives, so 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after the first train arrives.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train departs.
   - The second train departs 65 minutes after the first train arrives, so the third train arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - The third train departs immediately after it arrives, so it departs 125 minutes after the first train arrives.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs.
   - The third train departs 125 minutes after the first train arrives, so the fourth train arrives 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Paul will board the fourth train, which arrives 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Since the first train arrives 10 minutes after Paul starts waiting, the fourth train will arrive 145 - 10 = 135 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

Thus, the total time Paul will wait for his train is:
\[
\boxed{135}

"First, let's determine how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks required:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can determine how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
   \]

2. **Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid for the watch:**
   - Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend paid} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
   \]

3. **Determine the discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - The price Mr. Rogers' friend paid is $1800.
   - The discount is the difference between the original price and the price paid by Mr. Rogers' friend.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage discount:**
   - The percentage discount is given by the ratio of the discount to the original price, multiplied by 100.
   \[
   \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of seconds in 4 hours is:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 14400 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create:
     \[
     14400 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create:
     \[
     5 \times 14400 = 72000 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is:
\[

"To find Frankie's score, we start by defining the relationship between Frankie's score and Binkie's score based on the information given.

Let \( B \) represent Binkie's score, and \( F \) represent Frankie's score. According to the problem, Binkie's score is 90, so we have:
\[ B = 90 \]

The problem states that Frankie's score was 15 more than twice Binkie's score. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2(90) + 15 \]

Now, perform the multiplication and addition:
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

1. **Calculate the total distance walked:**
   - James walked halfway to the store, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
   - He then walked back home, which is another 2 miles.
   - He then walked from home to the store, which is 4 miles.
   - Therefore, the total distance walked is \( 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 \) miles.

2. **Determine the time taken:**
   - James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
   - The time taken to walk a distance is given by the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \).
   - Substituting the values, we get \( \text{time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \).

Thus, the total time it took James to reach the store is \(\boxed{2}\) hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times 0.80 \text{ dollars per banana} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost for 10 bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars per bunch} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is the difference between the two costs:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[
\frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, we use this growth rate to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years. We multiply the annual growth rate by 13 years:

\[
2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Trekking bikes: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150 \)
   - BMX bikes: \( 15\% \times 300 = 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
   - MTB bikes: \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \)

2. **Determine the price of each type of bike:**
   - MTB: $500
   - BMX: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 500 = 250 \)
   - Trekking: $450

3. **Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Earnings from MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \)
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)

4. **Sum the earnings from all types of bikes:**
   \[
   52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250
   \]

Thus, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour day, we need to calculate the net change in the number of bales each hour and then extend that to the full 6-hour period.

1. **Calculate the number of bales made by the farmer each hour:**
   \[
   \text{Bales made per hour} = 5
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck each hour:**
   \[
   \text{Bales picked up per hour} = 3
   \]

3. **Calculate the net change in the number of bales each hour:**
   \[
   \text{Net change per hour} = \text{Bales made per hour} - \text{Bales picked up per hour} = 5 - 3 = 2
   \]

4. **Calculate the total net change over 6 hours:**
   \[
   \text{Total net change in 6 hours} = \text{Net change per hour} \times 6 = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

5. **Determine the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours:**
   Since the net change is positive, the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is the total net change:
   \[
   \text{Bales left in the field} = 12
   \]

Thus, the number of bales of hay left in the field after a 6-hour day is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:

\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on these days.

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time spent learning in a week is the sum of the time spent in classes and the extra learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 1700 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1700 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:

\[ \boxed{28.33} \]"
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial drop height is:
   \[
   3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
   \[
   72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
   \[
   48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:
\[
\boxed{32 \text{ feet}}
\]"
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child step by step.

1. **First Child:**
   The first child is 6 feet tall.
   Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we convert the height to inches:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second Child:**
   The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child.
   \[
   72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third Child:**
   The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.
   \[
   74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Fourth Child:**
   The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child.
   \[
   69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

Thus, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \(\boxed{1080}\) kilograms."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall.

The north and south walls are both 10 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are both 5 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together, we get the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

   - Total sodas: 12
   - Shaken sodas: 3
   - Unshaken sodas: 9

2. **Ellen's Actions:**
   - Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - Unshaken sodas left: \(9 - 1 = 8\)
   - Shaken sodas left: 3

3. **Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - Shaken sodas left: \(3 - 1 = 2\)
   - Unshaken sodas left: \(8 - 2 = 6\)

4. **Remaining Sodas:**
   - Shaken sodas: 2
   - Unshaken sodas: 6
   - Total sodas left: \(2 + 6 = 8\)

5. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.
   - Probability = \(\frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}\)

6. **Convert to Percentage:**
   - \(\frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\%\)

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(\boxed{25\%}\)."
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

1. **Calculate the speed of the second train:**
   - The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
   - The second train travels at half the speed of the first train.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the second train} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by each train in 3 hours:**
   - Distance is calculated using the formula: \(\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}\).

   For the first train:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

   For the second train:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance between the two trains:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, the two trains are \(\boxed{270}\) miles apart after 3 hours."

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the second biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{second biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second biggest}}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[
\frac{J}{5}
\]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15}
\]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{J}{15} = 6
\]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[
J = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"To determine the total population of the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school by \( P \).

Since 40% of \( P \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

   - Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height from these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
   - Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height from these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
   - Therefore, the total height contributed by all the heels is \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

2. **Total number of heels:**
   - There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels and 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total number of heels is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

3. **Average height of the heels:**
   - The average height is the total height divided by the total number of heels, which is \(\frac{18}{6} = 3\) inches.

So, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\) inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike.
2. Determine the total number of days in June.
3. Calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.
4. Determine how many more miles per day she needs to hike to meet her goal.

First, the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike is given as 9,300 miles.

Next, June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total number of miles she plans to hike per day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/walk} \times 2 \text{ walks/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike to complete her journey on time, we need to determine the number of miles she needs to hike per day to cover 9,300 miles in 30 days. This is calculated as:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, the additional miles per day she needs to hike is:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Therefore, Soledad must hike \(\boxed{60}\) more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

\[ 27 + 55 + 75 = 157 \]

Therefore, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's determine how much Pierre and Paul want in kilograms.

Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Paul wants one-third of the 12 kg of apples:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, we add the amounts that Pierre and Paul want to find out how much they have together:
\[
3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total, we subtract the amount that Pierre and Paul want from the total to find out how many kilograms Jacques has:
\[
12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

Therefore, the number of kilograms that James will have left is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"

   \]

7. **Amount of money left after spending:**
   \[
   32 - 24 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much money Anna spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount spent on the 2 books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since the 2 books cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Thus, the cost of each book is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class, we start with the number of students last year and then calculate the 20% increase.

1. Last year's enrollment: 50 students.
2. Calculate 20% of 50:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10
   \]
3. Add this increase to last year's enrollment to find this year's enrollment:
   \[
   50 + 10 = 60
   \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks. The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We can calculate the number of blinks per minute as follows:

\[
\text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate of blinks per minute:

\[
\text{Time in minutes} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it will take the light \(\boxed{9}\) minutes to blink 459 times."
"First, let's determine the initial number of each type of fish in Tate's garden pond:

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Next, we account for the new fish Tate buys:

- Male guppies: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Female guppies: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
- Male goldfishes: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- Female goldfishes: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

Now, we calculate the total number of male and female fishes:

- Total male fishes: \(6\) (male guppies) + \(5\) (male goldfishes) = \(11\)
- Total female fishes: \(8\) (female guppies) + \(8\) (female goldfishes) = \(16\)

Finally, we find the difference between the number of female and male fishes:

\[16 - 11 = 5\]

So, Tate has \(\boxed{5}\) more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan's chore was to walk the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time is \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior's chore was to do laundry, which took her more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's time.
   - Therefore, Dior's time is \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours (since ""well over 4 hours"" means at least 8 hours, but we can use the minimum of 9 hours for simplicity).

Now, we sum the times for all three chores:

\[
4 \text{ hours (Amalia)} + 6 \text{ hours (Megan)} + 9 \text{ hours (Dior)} = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\) hours."
"To determine how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance for one trip:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance for one trip} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance for a round trip:**
   - A round trip means going to his parents' place and coming back.
   - Distance for a round trip = Distance for one trip × 2
   \[
   \text{Distance for a round trip} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance for all visits in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance = Distance for a round trip × Number of visits
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles}

"First, let's determine how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let \( B \) represent the number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ B = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

So, Brian will walk \(\boxed{35}\) miles in 7 days."
"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first two workers:
\[ 2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the next two workers:
\[ 2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Now, let's find the total number of toys produced by these four workers:
\[ 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer needs a total of 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 more toys to meet the order. This means the total number of toys produced by the five workers is:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produced, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours they worked:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:
\[
\boxed{105}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. This means that the total number of stickers Kris received from Luis is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \). So, we have \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).

Now, we solve for \( S \):
\[
\frac{S}{4} = 16 \implies S = 16 \times 4 = 64
\]

Thus, the number of stickers Seth had in the beginning is \(\boxed{64}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

\[ 3 \text{ large bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per large bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M} \]

John wants to put 10 M&M in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M by the number of M&M per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M}}{10 \text{ M&M per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance for half the circumference of the Earth:**
   The circumference of the Earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of the circumference is:
   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days required for Alfie to fly this distance:**
   Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth."
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow the given relationships step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**
   - The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
   - The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine the speed of the fastest car:**
   - The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is \(\boxed{750}\) miles per hour."
"To determine Vince's current age, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

1. Let \( V \) be Vince's current age.
2. Two years ago, Liam's age was \( 16 - 2 = 14 \) years.
3. Two years ago, Vince's age was \( V - 2 \) years.
4. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   14 = 2(V - 2)
   \]

Next, we solve the equation for \( V \):

\[
14 = 2(V - 2)
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
7 = V - 2
\]

Add 2 to both sides:

\[
V = 9
\]

Thus, Vince is currently \(\boxed{9}\) years old."
"Let's define the number of eggs painted by each person with variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs painted by Arnold.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs painted by Madeline.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs painted by Camden.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs painted by Sarah.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is:
\[ \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the boxes is:
\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:
\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the length of the usable part of the tree:**
   - The tree is 80 feet tall.
   - John can use 80% of the tree.
   - Usable length = \( 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \) feet.

2. **Calculate the number of 4-foot logs:**
   - Each log is 4 feet long.
   - Number of logs = \( \frac{64}{4} = 16 \) logs.

3. **Calculate the number of planks from each log:**
   - From each log, he cuts 5 planks.
   - Total number of planks = \( 16 \times 5 = 80 \) planks.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from selling the planks:**

"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000 and her brother earns $10000, so together they earn:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary. Therefore, their mother earns:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we find the total amount of money they all have together by adding Valerie's salary, her brother's salary, and their mother's salary:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Thus, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[
\boxed{45000}

"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.

1. **Determine the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.
   - The total time for the walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.
   - Let \( t \) be the time spent on the sidewalk in minutes.

2. **Calculate the total time for the walk:**
   - Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
   - Total time = 40 minutes + \( t \)

3. **Determine the walking speeds:**
   - Let \( v \) be the speed on the beach in miles per minute.
   - The speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach, so it is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

4. **Calculate the time spent on the beach:**
   - Distance on the beach = 2 miles
   - Time on the beach = \(\frac{\text{Distance on the beach}}{\text{Speed on the beach}} = \frac{2}{v}\)
   - Given that the time on the beach is 40 minutes, we have:
     \[
     \frac{2}{v} = 40 \implies v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

5. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Distance on the sidewalk = 1 mile
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \( 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \)
   - Time on the sidewalk = \(\frac{\text{Distance on the sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on the sidewalk}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \text{ minutes}\)

6. **Calculate the total time for the walk:**
   - Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks. Therefore, the total amount saved so far is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more she needs to save to reach a total of $60. This can be calculated by subtracting the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28 by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane \(\boxed{7}\) more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. Calculate the number of blue birds in the 3 trees that each had 7 blue birds:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

2. Calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

3. The number of blue birds in the 1 tree that had 3 blue birds is:
   \[
   3
   \]

4. Add the results from the three parts together to get the total number of blue birds:
   \[
   21 + 8 + 3 = 32

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Bob originally has:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to solve for the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, we subtract 10 from his original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final number of marbles Bob will have is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, which means the average temperature of the mixed water must be at least 40 degrees.

The total volume of water in the bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces. The total temperature of the mixed water is the sum of the temperatures of the two portions of water. Therefore, the average temperature of the mixed water is given by:

\[
\frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, we calculate the numerator:

\[
4 \times 33 + 1 \times T = 132 + T
\]

Next, we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the cost is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the total cost. So, the cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}

   2 \text{ masks/outing} \times 3 \text{ outings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]

4. **Face masks used in 2 days:**
   To find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks used per day by 2:
   \[
   6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total number of eggs hidden by Cole:**
   \[
   3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Number of eggs found by Lamar:**
   \[
   \text{Lamar finds 5 eggs}
   \]

3. **Number of eggs found by Stacy:**
   \[
   \text{Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Number of eggs found by Charlie:**
   \[
   \text{Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy} = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs}
   \]

5. **Number of eggs found by Mei:**
   \[
   \text{Mei finds half as many as Charlie} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs}
   \]

6. **Total number of eggs found by all:**
   \[
   \text{Total found} = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs}
   \]

7. **Number of eggs still hidden in the yard:**
   \[
   \text{Total hidden} - \text{Total found} = 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs}
   \]

Thus, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so combined they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1248}
\]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   \[
   \text{Fruits} = 50
   \]

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   \[
   \text{Fruits} = 3 \times 50 = 150
   \]

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   \[
   \text{Fruits} = 7 \times 50 = 350
   \]

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   \[
   \text{Fruits} = 200 \text{ less than a 10-year-old tree}
   \]
   Let \( x \) be the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. Then:
   \[
   \text{Fruits} = x - 200
   \]

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   \[
   \text{Fruits} = 0
   \]

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   \[
   \text{Fruits} = 20 \times 50 = 1000
   \]

Next, we need to find the value of \( x \) (the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces). According to the problem, an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree:
\[
x - 200 = \text{Fruits of 8-year-old tree}
\]
We already know the fruits of the 8-year-old tree from the previous calculation:
\[
x - 200 = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]
Thus:
\[
x = 800 + 200 = 1000
\]

Now, we can sum up the fruits produced each year:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + (1000 - 200) + 0 + 1000
\]

Simplify the expression:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
\]

Add the numbers step by step:
\[
50 + 150 = 200
\]
\[
200 + 350 = 550
\]
\[
550 + 800 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 0 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 1000 = 2350
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits produced during the 10 years of the avocado tree's life is:
\[
\boxed{2350}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and gave Jack \(\frac{1}{5}\) of her money. We calculate \(\frac{1}{5}\) of $100 as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
\]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Jack originally had $100. Adding the $20 that Sophia gave him, we get:

\[
100 + 20 = 120
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jack has now is:

\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope in centimeters.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope in centimeters.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope in centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   R = 4B
   \]
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   B = Y - 7
   \]
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters:
   \[
   R + B + Y = 37
   \]

First, substitute \( R = 4B \) into the combined length equation:
\[
4B + B + Y = 37
\]
Simplify this to:
\[
5B + Y = 37
\]

Next, substitute \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[
5(Y - 7) + Y = 37
\]
Distribute and combine like terms:
\[
5Y - 35 + Y = 37
\]
\[
6Y - 35 = 37
\]
Add 35 to both sides:
\[
6Y = 72
\]
Divide by 6:
\[
Y = 12
\]

Now, find \( B \) using \( B = Y - 7 \):
\[
B = 12 - 7 = 5
\]

Finally, find \( R \) using \( R = 4B \):
\[
R = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]

Thus, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with:
\[ 15 - x \]
According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
Solving for \( x \), we subtract 12 from 15:
\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]
So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Since Ronnie originally had $5 and gave $3 to their little sister, the amount of money Ronnie has left is:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]
Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how many pints of red paint were used in the mural, we start by defining the total amount of paint and the distribution among the different colors.

Given:
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.
- The mural uses equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.

First, let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), the amount of white paint as \( W \), the amount of purple paint as \( P \), and the amount of yellow paint as \( Y \).

Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can write:
\[ R = W = P \]

We are also given that half the mural is yellow. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint is:
\[ Y = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

The total amount of paint used is the sum of the amounts of red, white, purple, and yellow paint:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting \( W \) and \( P \) with \( R \) and \( Y \) with 6, we get:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ 3R = 6 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ R = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:
\[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
\[ 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total area of the house is:
\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
   \[
   \text{Monday} = 3
   \]

2. **Tuesday:**
   She sees double the number of clouds as Monday.
   \[
   \text{Tuesday} = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   She sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Wednesday} = 6 \times 2 = 12
   \]

4. **Thursday:**
   She sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday.
   \[
   \text{Thursday} = 12 \times 2 = 24
   \]

5. **Friday:**
   She sees double the number of clouds as Thursday.
   \[
   \text{Friday} = 24 \times 2 = 48
   \]

Next, we sum the number of puffs counted each day to find the total for the week:
\[
\text{Total} = 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is:
\[
\boxed{93}

"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods. Therefore, the number of pods in the special size box is calculated as follows:

\[ 100 + 0.2 \times 100 = 100 + 20 = 120 \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \]

This means each pod in the special size box costs $0.10. Since we are using 1 pod per cycle, the cost per cycle is $0.10. To find out how many cycles we can run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per cycle:

\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 with the new box is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday: \( 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage:**
   - The teacher conserves chalk and uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - Daily usage: \( 20\% \) of the remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the remaining chalk each day:**
   - Let \( C_n \) be the remaining chalk after \( n \) days.
   - After the first day (Tuesday):
     \[
     C_1 = 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the second day (Wednesday):
     \[
     C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the third day (Thursday):
     \[
     C_3 = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the fourth day (Friday):
     \[
     C_4 = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \text{ inches}
     \]

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of teeth James has:**
   \[
   \text{Total teeth} = 30
   \]

2. **Determine the number of teeth the dentist drills:**
   \[
   \text{Teeth drilled} = 4
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of teeth the dentist caps:**
   The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills:
   \[
   \text{Teeth capped} = 4 + 7 = 11
   \]

4. **Find the total number of teeth fixed:**
   The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:
   \[
   \text{Total teeth fixed} = 4 + 11 = 15
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   The percentage of teeth fixed is given by the ratio of the total teeth fixed to the total number of teeth, multiplied by 100:
   \[
   \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\%

"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount had passed the expiry date.

Calculate the amount of milk that passed the expiry date:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. The company sold the milk at a cost of $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the refund for 1600 gallons is:
\[
1600 \times 3.5 = 1600 \times \frac{35}{10} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \text{ dollars}

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Solve for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{40}{2} \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently \(\boxed{20}\) years old."
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:**
   - Bob can buy 100 books for $500.
   - First, find out how many sets of $500 are in $27000:
     \[
     \frac{27000}{500} = 54
     \]
   - Since each set of $500 allows him to buy 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:
     \[
     54 \times 100 = 5400
     \]

2. **Determine the number of books per school:**
   - Bob distributes the $27000 equally among 3 schools.
   - First, find out how much money is allocated to each school:
     \[
     \frac{27000}{3} = 9000
     \]
   - Next, calculate how many books can be bought with $9000:
     - Since $500 buys 100 books, $1 buys:
       \[
       \frac{100}{500} = 0.2 \text{ books}
       \]
     - Therefore, $9000 buys:
       \[
       9000 \times 0.2 = 1800 \text{ books}
       \]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is \(\boxed{1800}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the miles run on the days Sam ran 3 miles:
- Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
- There are 3 days in total where Sam ran 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles for these days is \(3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}\).

Next, let's calculate the miles run on the days Sam ran 5 miles:
- Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday.
- There are 2 days in total where Sam ran 5 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles for these days is \(5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}\).

Now, we sum the miles run on all the days:
- Total miles = miles run on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday + miles run on Tuesday and Thursday
- Total miles = \(9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}\).

Thus, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's calculate the net rate of snowball production. Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many snowballs melt in an hour. There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, so the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is:
\[ 2 \text{ snowballs/15 minutes} \times 4 = 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

Therefore, the net rate of snowball production is:
\[ 20 \text{ snowballs/hour} - 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We do this by dividing the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of snowball production:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take Jay \(\boxed{5}\) hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary:**
   - Since the problem does not specify the current year, we can use the information about John and Jim's ages to find the answer.
   - We know that John is currently 28 years old.

2. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary.
   - Let \( J_{\text{John}} \) be John's age \( J \) years ago.
   - Let \( J_{\text{Jim}} \) be Jim's age \( J \) years ago.

3. **Set up the relationship between John and Jim's ages:**
   - According to the problem, John was twice as old as Jim \( J \) years ago.
   - Therefore, \( J_{\text{John}} = 2 \times J_{\text{Jim}} \).

4. **Express their current ages in terms of \( J \):**
   - John's current age: \( J_{\text{John}} + J = 28 \)
   - Jim's current age: \( J_{\text{Jim}} + J \)

5. **Substitute the relationship into the current age equation:**
   - Since \( J_{\text{John}} = 2 \times J_{\text{Jim}} \), we can substitute \( J_{\text{John}} \) in the current age equation:
     \[
     2 \times J_{\text{Jim}} + J = 28
     \]

6. **Solve for \( J_{\text{Jim}} \):**
   - Let \( J_{\text{Jim}} = x \). Then the equation becomes:
     \[
     2x + J = 28
     \]
   - We also know that \( J_{\text{John}} = 2x \), and since \( J_{\text{John}} + J = 28 \), we can substitute \( 2x \) for \( J_{\text{John}} \):
     \[
     2x + J = 28
     \]

7. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - From the equation \( 2x + J = 28 \), we can express \( J \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     J = 28 - 2x
     \]

8. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Jim's current age is \( J_{\text{Jim}} + J \):
     \[
     J_{\text{Jim}} + J = x + (28 - 2x) = 28 - x
     \]

9. **Find the value of \( x \):**
   - Since \( J_{\text{John}} = 2x \) and \( J_{\text{John}} + J = 28 \), we can solve for \( x \):
     \[
     2x + (28 - 2x) = 28
     \]
     This equation is always true, so we need to find \( x \) directly from the relationship:
     \[
     2x + J = 28
     \]
     Since \( J = 28 - 2x \), we can substitute back:
     \[
     2x + (28 - 2x) = 28
     \]
     This confirms our setup. Now, solve for \( x \):
     \[
     2x + J = 28
     \]
     \[
     2x + (28 - 2x) = 28
     \]
     \[
     x = 14 - J
     \]

10. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
    - Since \( J = 14 \):
      \[
      J_{\text{Jim}} = 14 - 14 = 14
      \]

Therefore, Jim is currently \(\boxed{14}\) years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple.

Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so she ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.

Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so he ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices together:
\[1 + 2 + 3 = 6\]

So, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **Determine the number of bandages used on the second day:**
   - On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages.
   - On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than on the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of bandages used on the second day is \(38 - 10 = 28\).

2. **Calculate the total number of bandages used in the first two days:**
   - The total number of bandages used in the first two days is \(38 + 28 = 66\).

3. **Determine the number of bandages ordered and used on the third day:**
   - On the third day, the nurses ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(0.5 \times 50 = 25\) bandages.
   - Therefore, the net increase in bandages on the third day is \(100 - 25 = 75\) bandages.

4. **Calculate the total number of bandages at the end of the third day:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
   - After the first two days, they had \(x - 66\) bandages.
   - After the third day, they had \(x - 66 + 75 = x + 9\) bandages.
   - We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation \(x + 9 = 78\).

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   x + 9 = 78
   \]
   \[
   x = 78 - 9
   \]
   \[
   x = 69
   \]

The number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{69}\)."

The cost for the haircut is:
\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60 \]

Next, we add the cost of the color, which is $40.

The total cost for the cut and color is:
\[ \$60 + \$40 = \$100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Jen works in April. Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate the total hours as follows:

\[
7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 180 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we calculate Jen's earnings from her hourly rate. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her earnings from her hourly work are:

\[
180 \text{ hours} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 270 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:

\[
270 \text{ dollars} + 10 \text{ dollars} = 280 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{280}

1. **Earnings from emptying the dishwasher:**
   - Jason earns $0.50 for each time he empties the dishwasher.
   - He did this 6 times.
   \[
   6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
   \]

2. **Earnings from doing his laundry:**
   - Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry.
   - He did this once.
   \[
   1 \times 3.00 = 3.00

3. **Earnings from cleaning his room:**
   - Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room.
   - He did this once.
   \[
   1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Earnings from taking the trash to the curb:**
   - Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb each week.
   - He did this twice.
   \[
   2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
   \]

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[
3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Jason earned is:
\[
\boxed{9.00}

"First, we need to determine the amount of blood a single shark has. According to the information provided, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood a shark has as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in a shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have in total. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks would have:

\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:
\[50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320\]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red pens.
2. Calculate the number of black pens.
3. Add the number of red pens and black pens together.

First, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we know that the number of black pens is twice the number of red pens. Therefore, the total number of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens together to find the total number of pens:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Thus, the total number of pens Alain has is:

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:
\[
\text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:
\[
\text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2400}

"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we start by calculating the total amount of exercise needed for all four dogs combined. We know that on average, the dogs need to walk 3 miles per day. Since there are 4 dogs, the total amount of exercise needed per day is:

\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the exercise requirements for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

We add these amounts together to find the total exercise needed for the first three dogs:

\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total exercise needed for the first three dogs from the overall total exercise needed:

\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets. The loan is 40% of the value of his house, which is worth $250,000.

\[
\text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
\]

Next, we determine how much of this loan amount John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount.

\[
\text{Amount used to pay debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
\]

Finally, we find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts by subtracting the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount.

\[
\text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000

Next, we calculate the total earnings. The price per kilogram of tuna is $0.50. Therefore, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[
128 \text{ kilograms} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/kilogram} = 64 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas."
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines at $72. Therefore, the selling price is:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8}
\]

To perform the multiplication:
\[
72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99
\]

So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

Thus, Trinity's profit is:
\[
\boxed{27}

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 5 days on the high setting.
   - Total water removed on the high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Finally, we sum the water removed at each setting to find the total amount of water removed from the air in the basement:

\[
3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons they threw, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons left} = 288 \text{ balloons thrown} \]

So, the number of balloons they threw is:

\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we first need to calculate the amount of medicine in one dose.

"First, let's determine the capacity of each class at Ali's school and John's school.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Each of John's classes has a capacity of \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class capacity. Therefore, the capacity of one of John's classes is:
\[
\frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:
\[
2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Now, we add the capacities of both schools to find the combined capacity:
\[
120 + 30 = 150
\]

Thus, the combined capacity of both schools is:
\[
\boxed{150}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest on the $300 he borrowed.

The interest is calculated as:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount that Stephen needs to pay in the twelfth month is the total amount he needs to return minus the amount he has already paid:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. Therefore, the number of diaper changes she handles is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Since the total number of changes per day is 10 and Jordan's wife handles 5 of them, the number of diaper changes Jordan handles is:

\[ 10 \text{ changes} - 5 \text{ changes} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

So, Jordan changes \(\boxed{5}\) diapers per day."
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for packing jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864

\]

Therefore, Ali has to pay John \(\boxed{100}\)."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\)."

"To determine the price of the toy after the changes in November, December, and January, we will follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price in November:**
   The toy was initially priced at $40.

2. **Price Increase in December:**
   The price increased by 80% in December. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 0.80 \times 40 = 32
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72
   \]

3. **Price Decrease in January:**
   The price decreased by 50% in January. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 0.50 \times 72 = 36
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36
   \]

Thus, the price of the toy after the discount in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"First, let's calculate the standard rate and the reduced rate for the veteran lessons.

Charlie's standard rate is $80 per hour. For veteran lessons, he reduces his rate by 25%. To find the reduced rate, we calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from the standard rate.

\[ \text{Reduction} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]
\[ \text{Reduced rate} = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from the 4 standard rate lessons and the 2 veteran rate lessons.

For the 4 standard rate lessons:
\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \]

For the 2 veteran rate lessons:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day.

1. **Sum all the scores**: Add up all the individual scores Sally received.
2. **Count the number of scores**: Determine how many quizzes Sally took.
3. **Calculate the mean**: Divide the total sum of the scores by the number of quizzes.

Let's start with the first step:

The scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

Sum of the scores:
\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \]

Calculating the sum step-by-step:
\[ 50 + 80 = 130 \]
\[ 130 + 80 = 210 \]
\[ 210 + 60 = 270 \]
\[ 270 + 40 = 310 \]
\[ 310 + 90 = 400 \]
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \]
\[ 500 + 70 = 570 \]
\[ 570 + 60 = 630 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we count the number of scores. Sally took 9 quizzes.

Now, we calculate the mean score by dividing the total sum by the number of quizzes:
\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{630}{9} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{630}{9} = 70 \]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is:

"To determine how many pomelos Eve gave away, we start by figuring out how many pomelos she has left after giving some away. According to the problem, after giving some pomelos to her friend, Eve is left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the pomelos she originally had.

Eve originally had 20 pomelos. Therefore, the number of pomelos she has left is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

This means Eve has 5 pomelos left. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the number of pomelos she originally had:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Thus, the number of pomelos Eve gave away is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]
So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some is:
\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]
Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. Since 25% is equivalent to \( \frac{1}{4} \), the number of apples given to his sister is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]
Therefore, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:
\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]
Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:
\[
27 \times 3 = 81
\]
Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{81}

"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to clean all classrooms:**
   - There are 80 classrooms.
   - It takes 15 minutes to clean each classroom.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Convert the total time into days:**
   - The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms.
   - There are 8 hours in a working day.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day}
   \]
   - Total working time over 5 days:
   \[
   5 \text{ days} \times 480 \text{ minutes/day} = 2400 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning:**
   - The total time required to clean all classrooms is 1200 minutes.
   - The total working time over 5 days is 2400 minutes.
   - Calculate the fraction of the day spent cleaning:
   \[
   \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{2400 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   - Convert the fraction to a percentage:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of the day, on average, spent cleaning classrooms is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Next, we calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. Since a bookcase has one top shelf, one bottom shelf, and two middle shelves, the total capacity is:
\[
15 + 20 + 2 \times 10 = 15 + 20 + 20 = 55 \text{ books}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many bookcases Elly needs to hold all 110 books. We do this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[
\frac{110}{55} = 2
\]

Since the result is a whole number, Elly needs exactly 2 bookcases to hold all of her books. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and the cost is $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine the selling price per egg. Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the price per egg is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \text{ dollars per egg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the eggs. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs, the total number of eggs is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs is:
\[ 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of red hats:**
   Skyler has 100 hats in total, and half of them are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining hats after accounting for the red hats:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of blue hats:**
   \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of white hats:**
   The rest of the hats are white. Therefore, the number of white hats is the remaining hats after accounting for the red and blue hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of one bag of beef jerky after the discount. The original price is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the price after the discount is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each stick of beef jerky costs. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag and the bag now costs $15.00, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of beef jerky is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"

Thus, Audrey needs to get \(\boxed{35}\) questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade."
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. To find the number of blueberry cubes, we substitute \( S = 20 \) into the expression for the number of blueberry cubes:
\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \(\boxed{96}\)."

"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   - Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will have twice the amount of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, the total amount of lemonade needed is \(4 + 1 = 5\) gallons.

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed for the regular lemonade:**
   - For 4 gallons of lemonade, the recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon.
   - So, for 4 gallons, the amount of lemon juice needed is \(4 \text{ cups}\).

3. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed for the extra gallon:**
   - The extra gallon is twice as tart, so it will require twice the amount of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, the extra gallon will need \(2 \text{ cups}\) of lemon juice.

4. **Calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - The total amount of lemon juice needed is \(4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups}\).

5. **Determine the number of lemons needed:**
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, to get 6 cups of juice, Tim will need \(6 \times 6 = 36\) lemons.

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim will need is \(\boxed{36}\)."

"To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

1. Let the number of blue blocks be \( B \).
2. Let the number of yellow blocks be \( Y \).
3. Let the number of red blocks be \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
- The number of blue blocks \( B \) is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks \( Y \) is twice the number of blue blocks, so \( Y = 2 \times B = 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

The total number of blocks can be expressed as the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks:
\[ B + Y + R = 32 \]

Substituting the known values of \( B \) and \( Y \) into the equation:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Thus, the number of red blocks is \(\boxed{20}\)."

"To determine how much money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in one day.
2. Determine the number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the chocolate bars.

**Step 1: Number of chocolate bars produced in one day**
The company produces 5000 bars per day.

**Step 2: Number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks**
There are 14 days in two weeks. Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks is:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

**Step 3: Total revenue from selling the chocolate bars**
The company sells each bar for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the company will receive \(\boxed{140000}\) dollars for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"To determine the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the cost of the T-shirts:**
   - The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
   - Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal.
   - The first T-shirt costs $8.
   - The second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs \(8 \times 0.5 = 4\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the T-shirts is \(8 + 4 = 12\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the shoes:**
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - The shoes are 40% off, so Jake pays 60% of the original price.
   - The cost of the shoes is \(40 \times 0.6 = 24\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes.
   - Therefore, the total amount spent is \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has after 3 weeks of completing his chores. Since he gets $6 each week, we can calculate his total allowance as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dollars/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ryan uses some of this money to buy ice cream cones for himself and his 3 friends. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for 4 ice cream cones is:

\[ 1.25 \text{ dollars/cone} \times 4 \text{ cones} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream from his total allowance, we get:

\[ 18 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Ryan and his 3 friends want to go to the movies. The cost of one movie ticket is $6.50. Since there are 4 people, the total cost for 4 movie tickets is:

\[ 6.50 \text{ dollars/ticket} \times 4 \text{ tickets} = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Ryan only has $13, he cannot afford to buy 4 movie tickets. We need to determine how many movie tickets he can buy with his $13. We do this by dividing his remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \text{ dollars} \div 6.50 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 2 \text{ tickets} \]

Therefore, the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in all, we need to calculate the total amount each of them spent and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate how much Ellen spent:
- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.
- Ellen also bought a photo frame for $5.
So, the total amount Ellen spent is:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Lani spent:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100. Therefore, the cost of the two bathrobes is:
\[ 100 + 100 = 200 \]
So, the total amount Lani spent is:
\[ 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, we add the amounts spent by Ellen and Lani to find the total amount spent by both of them:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

Therefore, the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani is:
\[ \boxed{335} \]"
"To determine Tim's profit from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the total cost of ingredients for one jar and then for 10 jars, and subtract this from the total revenue from selling 10 jars.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: \(2 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$12\)
- Jackfruit: \(1.5 \text{ pounds} \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$12\)
- Honey: \(2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$20\)

Adding these together gives the total cost for one jar:
\[
\$12 + \$12 + \$20 = \$44
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
\[
10 \text{ jars} \times \$44/\text{jar} = \$440
\]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:
\[
10 \text{ jars} \times \$50/\text{jar} = \$500
\]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$500 - \$440 = \$60
\]

Thus, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"

"Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for half of the collection and $7 per toy for the other half.

First, we calculate the number of toys in each half:
\[
\frac{12}{2} = 6
\]

Next, we calculate the earnings from the first half of the collection:
\[
6 \text{ toys} \times \$5 \text{ per toy} = \$30
\]

Then, we calculate the earnings from the second half of the collection:
\[
6 \text{ toys} \times \$7 \text{ per toy} = \$42
\]

Finally, we add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount of money Matthew would earn:

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes net reduction/day} \]

We need to determine how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a net rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. 

The final answer is:

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled \(\boxed{5}\) more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of mechanic's labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is \(\boxed{230}\)."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the number of chickens.
- \( K \) as the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, let's determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since each of the 7 pizzas is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is calculated as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
