"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after using some for breakfast and baking muffins.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
3. She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we start by identifying the amount of each type of fiber required.

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The amount of white fiber needed is half the amount of blue fiber. Therefore, the white fiber required is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

Next, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts needed:
\[
2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
\]

Thus, the total number of bolts needed is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs:**
   - Cost of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total cost: \( 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \)

2. **Determine the new value of the house after the repairs:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.
   - To find 150% of the original value of the house: \( 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \)
   - New value of the house: \( 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \)

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost.
   - Profit: \( 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \)

Therefore, Josh's profit is \(\boxed{70000}\)."

"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

First, let's calculate the cost for the second glass:
\[ 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \]

Now, we can see that the pattern is: $5, $3, $5, $3, and so on. This means that for every pair of glasses, the cost is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can determine the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 16 glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

So, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

The net profit each year is the revenue from selling lemons minus the annual expenses:
\[
\text{Net profit per year} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5
\]

Next, we need to find the number of years \( n \) it will take for the total net profit to equal or exceed the initial cost of $90. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:
\[
7.5n
\]

We set up the inequality to find when the total net profit equals or exceeds $90:
\[
7.5n \geq 90
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

\[
\boxed{12}

"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]
   According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]

4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{x}{3} = 6 \implies x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."

\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

This means the second stop was at the 45-mile mark. Now, we need to find the distance between the first stop (20 miles) and the second stop (45 miles):
\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

The problem states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell and Allen's current ages based on the given ratio. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the sum of their ages is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Let's break down the guesses from Gunter's friends:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these guesses. The guesses are 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by the number of guesses:

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

There are 3 guesses, so we divide the total by 3:

\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the daily care time for one dog.
2. Calculate the total daily care time for all dogs.
3. Calculate the total weekly care time for all dogs.

Step 1: Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.

Step 2: John has 10 dogs, so the total daily care time for all dogs is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Step 3: There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly care time is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's define the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( G + S = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.

First, calculate 25% of the points scored in the first 20 minutes:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, add the points from both halves of the game to find the total points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days. Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This can be calculated by dividing 60 by 4:

\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

\[ \$75.00 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total money John gets from selling the lego sets:**
   John has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.
   \[
   13 \text{ lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per lego set} = \$195
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the video games:**
   John buys 8 video games at $20 each.
   \[
   8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160
   \]

3. **Determine how much money John has left after buying the video games:**
   John has $5 left after buying the video games.
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \$195 - \$160 = \$35
   \]
   According to the problem, this amount is indeed $5, which confirms our calculations so far.

"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the right-hand side:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours given the specified time allocations for running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana's skipping speed is given as 3 miles per hour.
   - Her running speed is half of her skipping speed.
   \[
   \text{Running speed} = \frac{3 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed.
   \[
   \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1.5 \text{ miles per hour}}{4} = 0.375 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time available is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running.
   \[
   \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking.
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   \[
   \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ miles}

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin, we need to calculate the throwing distance of the javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.

1. Polly's normal throwing distance without the gemstone is 400 feet.
2. When holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.

So, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. Therefore, the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon is:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the initial number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine the calorie content of the entire 300g bag of chips. Since the bag has 5 servings and each serving is 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day after you have already consumed 1800 calories out of your daily target of 2000 calories:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since the entire 300g bag contains 1250 calories, we can find the calorie content per gram:

\[ \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \text{ calories/gram} = \frac{25}{6} \text{ calories/gram} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \]

To find out how many grams of chips you can eat with 200 calories, we use the following calculation:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{\frac{25}{6} \text{ calories/gram}} = 200 \times \frac{6}{25} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips. 

Final answer:
\[ 48 \text{ grams} \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the total cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7
  \]
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

First, we calculate the total number of Post-it notes used and remaining before considering the package she bought:
\[ \text{Total notes used and remaining} = 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Next, we know that she initially had 80 Post-it notes. Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. The equation representing the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is:
\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to account for the 25% fee, the $3.00 delivery fee, and the $4.00 tip. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the 25% fee on the initial bill:**
   The initial bill is $40.00. A 25% fee on this amount is calculated as:
   \[
   0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00
   \]
   So, the total after adding the 25% fee is:
   \[
   40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00
   \]

2. **Add the delivery fee:**
   The delivery fee is $3.00. Adding this to the total gives:
   \[
   50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00
   \]

3. **Add the tip:**
   The tip is $4.00. Adding this to the total gives:
   \[
   53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00
   \]

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is:

"To determine the number of good oranges in the basket, we need to account for the total number of oranges and subtract the ones that are not good.

1. Total number of oranges: 25
2. Number of bad oranges: 1
3. Number of unripe oranges: 20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5
4. Number of sour oranges: 2

Now, we add up the oranges that are not good:
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 5
- Sour oranges: 2

Total non-good oranges = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8

Therefore, the number of good oranges is:
25 (total oranges) - 8 (non-good oranges) = 17

So, the number of good oranges is 17."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials and the construction of the brooch. Janet spends $500 on materials and $800 on the jeweler to construct it. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, Janet pays 10% of this total amount to get the brooch insured. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:

\[ 0.10 \times 1300 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the original total cost to find the final amount Janet paid:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1430} \]"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial annual pension**: Marcy gets an annual pension of $50,000 per year for the first 20 years.

2. **Determine the additional pension after 20 years**: Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year.

3. **Calculate the additional pension after 20 years**: Since she quits after 30 years, she will have been entitled to the additional 5% for 10 years (from year 21 to year 30).

4. **Calculate the total annual pension after 30 years**:
   - The initial annual pension remains $50,000.
   - The additional pension is 5% of $50,000, which is \(0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500\).

5. **Sum the initial and additional pensions**:
   - Total annual pension = Initial annual pension + Additional annual pension
   - Total annual pension = $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be **$52,500**."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and apply the given conditions.

1. **Initial Monthly Charge:**
   - The initial monthly charge is $140.

2. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.

"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent each week is:
\[3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}\]

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys').
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 5 (girls) + 5 (boys) = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 2 coaches

Therefore, the total number of people per school is:
- 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people is:
- 12 people/school * 4 schools = 48 people

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the number of games the team won is \( 15 \).

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold \(\boxed{8000}\) copies."
"First, let's determine how many guests are expected to actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, this means that 3/4 of the invited guests will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests expected to attend is:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of gift bags required. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest who shows up. Therefore, the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Thus, the total amount Christina will spend is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adults and the children.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
10 \text{ lbs/adult} \times 20 \text{ adults} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children:
- Each child will eat half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \).
- There are 5 children.

\[
5 \text{ lbs/child} \times 5 \text{ children} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we add the amounts needed for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad required:

\[
200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"To determine the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of pets Cindy has:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Calculate the number of pets Marcia has:**
   Marcia has two more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Number of pets Marcia has} = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pets Jan has:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   \[
   \text{Number of pets Jan has} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   Add the number of pets each person has.
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28

"To determine Jackson's age, let's use the information provided step by step.

1. We know James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, Corey's age is:
   \[
   \text{Corey's age} = 10 + 1 = 11
   \]

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore, Amy's age is:
   \[
   \text{Amy's age} = 11 - 2 = 9
   \]

3. Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson's age is:
   \[
   \text{Jackson's age} = 9 - 5 = 4
   \]

So, Jackson is \(\boxed{4}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Since Lee now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out Gerald's new time after his diet improved his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement in speed means his new time is 90% of his original time. We calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times 0.90 = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is given as 60.
   - The number of cats is two times the number of dogs. Therefore, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits. Therefore, the total number of pets is \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{348}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:
\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. The problem states that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when cooked into sauce. Therefore, the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking.

2. **Calculate the volume of tomatoes before cooking**: Since the sauce made is 32 ounces and it is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of cans used**: Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of tomatoes**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, Freda used \(\boxed{12}\) tomatoes."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
- 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
- Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be calculated by adding the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes, and then subtracting the 5 cars that took an exit. This total should equal the original number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she currently has is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, the total number of plants she will give away is:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she currently has:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, we add the 18 new potted plants she received from the nursery to the remaining plants:

\[ 40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all four friends:
\[20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Daily Water Intake:**
   - John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
   - He also has a glass of water before bed.
   - Therefore, each weekday, John drinks \(3\) (meals) + \(1\) (before bed) = \(4\) glasses of water.

2. **Weekday Water Intake:**
   - There are \(5\) weekdays in a week.
   - So, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is \(4\) glasses/day \(\times 5\) days = \(20\) glasses.

3. **Weekend Water Intake:**
   - On weekends, John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but he has a soda instead of water before bed.
   - Therefore, each weekend day, John drinks \(3\) glasses of water.
   - There are \(2\) weekend days in a week.
   - So, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is \(3\) glasses/day \(\times 2\) days = \(6\) glasses.

4. **Total Weekly Water Intake:**

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box and then calculate its inner volume. Finally, we will multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume for all 3 boxes.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The original dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
   - Inner width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
   - Inner height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Substituting the inner dimensions:

1. **Monday and Tuesday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode each night.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\)

2. **Wednesday**: Frankie watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show.
   - Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.
   - Total for Wednesday: \(0.5x \text{ hours}\)

3. **Thursday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\)

4. **Friday**: Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(2 \text{ hours}\)

The total time spent watching TV over the week is 7 hours. We can set up the following equation to represent the total time:

\[
2 \text{ hours (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ hours (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ hours (Friday)} = 7 \text{ hours}
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7
\]

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought:
- She bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:
- She sells the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at the current price, which is 50% higher than the original price of $10.
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15 \text{ per board}
  \]
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- She sells the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at the current price, which is 50% higher than the original price of $16.
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24 \text{ per board}
  \]
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- Therefore, the total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90
\]

Thus, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{90}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total parts of the mixture (sugar + water) is \(7 + 13 = 20\) parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water combined. Since the total parts of the mixture is 20, we can set up the following proportion to find out how many teaspoons correspond to one part:

\[
\text{1 part} = \frac{120 \text{ teaspoons}}{20} = 6 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

Since the sugar makes up 7 parts of the mixture, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is:

\[
7 \text{ parts} \times 6 \text{ teaspoons per part} = 42 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

\[
\boxed{42}

"First, let's determine the number of vehicles that were initially at the port. The customs officer counted 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the initial number of vehicles is:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means that the number of vehicles brought in on the second day is:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23 \).

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is \( 40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \).

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming her salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her new salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.4 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Adrien's new salary is $56,000.
   - Lylah's new salary is approximately $43,076.92.
   - Therefore, the total salary is \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \).

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\)."

"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments based on her speed changes.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours

   Distance covered in the first segment:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Speed: 5 miles per hour
   - Time: Total time - Time in the first segment = 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours

   Distance covered in the second segment:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - Sum of distances from both segments:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

"Let's define the variables for the number of each type of bee:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B = 2Q \) into the equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ W + B + Q = 4Q + 2Q + Q = 7Q = 700. \]

Solving for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400. \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the food items (milk and eggs):
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total cost of food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:

\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles of bleach per client} = 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \]
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack of cloths per client} = 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the bleach and cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cloths costs $5, so:

\[ 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} = \$32 \]
\[ 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$40 \]

Adding these together gives the total expenses:

\[ \$32 + \$40 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:

- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Steve takes less time to get home, he is the winner. The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of tires Shawnda inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we add up all the tires inflated:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost in cents is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar):
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of these cookies:

\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10 \text{ per cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so we need to find out how much change he receives after paying $6.00:

\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$4.00 \]"
"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's work backwards from the end to the beginning:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate their 9 fries, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate its 7 fries, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate his 14 fries, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
  - He has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
  - Total hours for these days: \(3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
  - He has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
  - Total hours for these days: \(2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours}\).

Now, let's add the hours from all five days to find the total weekly hours:
\[3 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours/week}\]

Next, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester (16 weeks):
\[7 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 112 \text{ hours}\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
\boxed{112}
\]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to feet since the final answer needs to be in feet.

- Each roll is 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
- Each chocolate croissant is 6 inches long, so each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Next, we calculate the total length of each type of baked good in feet:

- For the rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- For the chocolate croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- For the baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Now, we add these lengths together to find the total length of all the baked goods:

\[ 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is \( \boxed{280} \) feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly banana requirement for each type of ape and then double that amount since the bananas are ordered every 2 months.

1. **Monkeys' requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas} \)

2. **Gorillas' requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas} \)

3. **Baboons' requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas} \)

Now, we add up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over 2 months:
\[ 400 \text{ bananas (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ bananas (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ bananas (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long and Blake runs back and forth 15 times, the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 100 \text{ yards} \times 2 \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is a round trip of 80 yards, and she does this 34 times. So, the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 80 \text{ yards} \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. Since Blake runs farther, we subtract the distance Kelly runs from the distance Blake runs:

\[ 3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."
"To determine how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the pens, notebooks, and bond paper he bought.

1. **Cost of Pens:**
   - Raphael bought 4 pens.
   - Each pen costs $1.5.
   - Total cost for pens = \( 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of Notebooks:**
   - Raphael bought 2 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs $4.
   - Total cost for notebooks = \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of Bond Paper:**
   - Raphael bought 1 rim of bond paper.
   - The bond paper costs $20.
   - Total cost for bond paper = \( 20 \) dollars.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper
- Total cost = \( 6 + 8 + 20 = 34 \) dollars.

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of **34 dollars** on everything."
"To determine how many tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Initially, Finn watches 11 tadpoles.
2. Then, 6 of these tadpoles come out from under a lily pad. This means the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6.
3. After that, 2 of the tadpoles hide under a rock. This means the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2.

Let's calculate the number of tadpoles Finn can see now:

- Initially, he sees 11 tadpoles.
- After 6 more come out, he sees \(11 + 6 = 17\) tadpoles.
- After 2 hide under a rock, he sees \(17 - 2 = 15\) tadpoles.

So, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is:

15

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Depth on Monday**: The tank has a depth of 17 feet.

2. **Depth on Tuesday**: The tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Depth on Wednesday**: The depth of the water on Wednesday is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is **16 feet**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish each person caught.

**Anakin's Catch:**
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total for Anakin:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

**Locsin's Catch:**
- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin, so \(10 - 5 = 5\)
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin, so \(6 - 3 = 3\)
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin, so \(3 + 2 = 5\)

Total for Locsin:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

**Total Fish Caught by Both:**
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

So, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

1. **Initial Price**: The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Calculation**:
   - The price increases by 20% every two months. A 20% increase means the price is multiplied by \(1 + 0.20 = 1.20\) every two months.

3. **Number of Increases**:
   - Since the price increases every two months, in 36 months, the number of increases is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).

4. **Final Price Calculation**:
   - The final price after 36 months can be calculated by multiplying the original price by \(1.20\) eighteen times. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

5. **Compute the Value**:
   - First, calculate \(1.20^{18}\):
     \[
     1.20^{18} \approx 10.0633
     \]
   - Then, multiply this result by the original price:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 10.0633 \approx 201.266

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to calculate the financial impact of both options and then compare them.

1. **Cost of hiring an accountant:**
   The accountant charges $90.

2. **Income lost by doing taxes herself:**
   - Jackie will lose 3 hours of freelance work.
   - She earns $35 per hour from freelance work.
   - Therefore, the income lost is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105\).

3. **Net financial impact:**
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she spends $90.
   - If she does her taxes herself, she loses $105 in potential income.
   - The difference in net financial impact is \( \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \).

Thus, Jackie will have \(\boxed{15}\) dollars more if she hires the accountant."
"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and then subtract this from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Mouse: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, we sum up the costs of the items that are not included in the computer price:
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total additional cost = €157 + €74 + €102 = €333

Next, we add this to the cost of the computer:
Total cost = €1090 + €333 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
Money left = €1500 - €1423 = €77

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 Spanish flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how much money Jimmy has, we start by identifying the amount of money Ethel has. According to the problem, Ethel has $8.

The problem states that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ \text{Jimmy's money} = 2 \times (\text{Ethel's money}) + 2 \]

Substituting the amount of money Ethel has into the equation:
\[ \text{Jimmy's money} = 2 \times 8 + 2 \]

Next, we perform the multiplication:
\[ \text{Jimmy's money} = 16 + 2 \]

Finally, we add the two numbers together:
\[ \text{Jimmy's money} = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has \(\boxed{18}\) dollars."
"To determine how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to break down his walking schedule.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - Pancho walks 20 miles each day.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Total miles walked on weekdays = \( 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Pancho walks 10 miles each day.
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - Total miles walked on weekends = \( 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Total miles walked in a week:**
   - Total miles = miles walked on weekdays + miles walked on weekends.
   - Total miles = \( 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, Pancho walks a total of **120 miles** in a week."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Hat Cost**: The hat costs $25.
2. **Jacket Cost**: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, the jacket costs \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. **Pants Cost**: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[ 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each group of creatures and then sum them up.

"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make for all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time spent on peeling and cutting each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to find the total time for peeling and cutting all of them.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time for peeling all potatoes.**
- Time to peel one potato = 1.5 minutes
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes = 1.5 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes

**Step 2: Calculate the total time for cutting all potatoes.**
- Time to cut one potato = 5 seconds
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes = 5 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

**Step 3: Convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes.**
- 300 seconds = 300 / 60 = 5 minutes

**Step 4: Add the total time for peeling and cutting.**
- Total time for peeling = 90 minutes
- Total time for cutting = 5 minutes
- Total prep time = 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost of lemons and sugar.
   - The profit is given by the total revenue minus the total cost: \( \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - C \).
   - Therefore, \( 25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C \).

2. **Express the total revenue in terms of the number of glasses sold:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of glasses sold.
   - Each glass is sold for $0.50, so the total revenue is \( 0.50x \).

3. **Express the total cost in terms of the number of gallons made:**
   - Let \( g \) be the number of gallons made.
   - Each gallon costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is \( 5g \).

4. **Relate the number of glasses sold to the number of gallons made:**
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon, so \( x = 20g \).

5. **Substitute \( x \) and \( C \) into the profit equation:**
   - \( 25 = 0.50(20g) - 5g \).
   - Simplify the equation: \( 25 = 10g - 5g \).
   - \( 25 = 5g \).

6. **Solve for \( g \):**
   - \( g = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \).

7. **Calculate the total cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost of lemons is \( 3g = 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

The amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of crabs each person has and then sum these amounts.

1. **Determine the number of crabs Bo has:**
   Bo has 40 crabs.

2. **Determine the number of crabs Monic has:**
   Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of crabs Monic has} = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]

3. **Determine the number of crabs Rani has:**
   Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of crabs Rani has} = 36 + 10 = 46
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:**
   We sum the crabs of Bo, Monic, and Rani:
   \[
   \text{Total number of crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122
   \]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is \(\boxed{122}\)."
"To determine how much Lloyd earned over the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate his earnings for the first week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the first week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours tutored} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate his earnings for the second week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the second week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours tutored} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both weeks to find the total earnings:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings for the first week} + \text{Earnings for the second week} = 50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of \(\boxed{130}\) dollars for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60 \]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is \( 20 \)."
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first establish the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

According to the problem, Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. The problem states that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as \( R \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Thus, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the current ages:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jan's current age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's current age.
   - Let \( \text{Jean's current age} \) be \( J - 2 \) (since Jean is two years older than Mark).

2. **Given information:**
   - Jan's current age \( J = 30 \).
   - Jean's current age is \( J - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28 \).

3. **Two years ago:**
   - Jan's age two years ago was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
   - Mark's age two years ago was \( M - 2 \).

4. **Relationship from the problem:**
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - This can be written as: \( M - 2 = \frac{28}{2} + 5 \).

5. **Solve for Mark's age:**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation: \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).
   - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 19 \).
   - Add 2 to both sides to find \( M \): \( M = 21 \).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Jean's current age is \( 28 \).

The final answer is:

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Slower Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner runs in:
\[ 60 - 3 = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner runs in:
\[ 57 - 3 = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner runs in:
\[ 54 - 3 = 51 \text{ seconds} \]
Total time for the slower team:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the slower team and the faster team is:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:

\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in probabilities
Now, we find the difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:

\[ \text{Difference} = P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

### Step 4: Convert the difference to a percentage
To express the difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

### Final Answer
Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed among all small rodents is 160 pieces.
   - Straw for hamsters = 50 pieces.
   - Straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.
   - Straw for rats = \(160 - 50 - 20 = 90\) pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats and the straw each rat gets:**
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \(r\) be the number of rats.
   - Total straw for rats = \(6r = 90\).
   - Solving for \(r\), we get \(r = \frac{90}{6} = 15\).

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**

"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the compounded interest over these months. The initial amount Mandy owes is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%.

The formula for the amount after \( n \) months with a monthly interest rate \( r \) is:
\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount after \( n \) months,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate,
- \( n \) is the number of months.

Here, \( P = 100 \), \( r = 0.02 \), and \( n = 3 \).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.02)^3 \):
\[ (1.02)^3 = 1.02 \times 1.02 \times 1.02 \approx 1.061208 \]

So,
\[ A \approx 100 \times 1.061208 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict is:

Therefore, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the cost of food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"

"To determine how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock.
2. Convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For a flock of ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly requirement by 7:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
2. He edits an equal number of sentences for each of the two publishers.
3. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.
4. Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A per sentence.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A:
- Payment per sentence from Publisher A = 5 cents
- Number of sentences edited for Publisher A = 500
- Total payment from Publisher A = 5 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 2500 cents

Now, we calculate the payment from Publisher B:
- Payment per sentence from Publisher B = 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents
- Number of sentences edited for Publisher B = 500
- Total payment from Publisher B = 10 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 5000 cents

Finally, we add the payments from both publishers to find the total amount Mark makes in a week:
- Total payment = Payment from Publisher A + Payment from Publisher B
- Total payment = 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."

     \]

2. **Cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices per omelet.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for omelets is:
     \[
     3 \text{ slices/omelet} \times 3 \text{ omelets} = 9 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**

5. **Since Brinley can remove the lowest score from the first five tests, we need to consider the possible lowest scores and their impact on the average. The lowest score among 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 is 71.**

6. **Remove the lowest score (71) and calculate the new total score:**
   \[
   438 - 71 = 367
   \]

7. **Add the sixth test score \( x \) to the new total score:**
   \[
   367 + x
   \]

8. **Set up the equation for the desired average:**
   \[
   \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
   \]

9. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   367 + x = 93 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   367 + x = 465
   \]
   \[
   x = 465 - 367
   \]
   \[
   x = 98
   \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score \(\boxed{98}\) on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

First, calculate the total kilometers for one week:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 125 \text{ kilometers/week} \]

Next, calculate the total kilometers for four weeks:
\[ 125 \text{ kilometers/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ kilometers} \]

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

First, calculate the total kilometers for one week:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 120 \text{ kilometers/week} \]

Next, calculate the total kilometers for three weeks:
\[ 120 \text{ kilometers/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ kilometers} \]

**Total Kilometers:**
Now, add the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks:
\[ 500 \text{ kilometers} + 360 \text{ kilometers} = 860 \text{ kilometers} \]

Thus, the total number of kilometers Micheal did is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the weight of each candied apple:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   - Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
   - Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is:
     \[
     \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:**
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   - The total weight of the chocolate bars is:
     \[
     25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the candied apples:**
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Each candied apple weighs 20 grams.
   - The total weight of the candied apples is:
     \[
     80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the bag of candy:**
   - The total weight is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples.
   - Therefore, the total weight is:
     \[
     1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams}
     \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2600}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Monday:**
   - Rose bought 4 cakes.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday.
   - Number of cakes on Tuesday = \(3 \times 4 = 12\).

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
   - Number of cakes on Wednesday = \(5 \times 12 = 60\).

Now, we sum up the total number of cakes bought over the three days:

- Total cakes = Cakes on Monday + Cakes on Tuesday + Cakes on Wednesday
- Total cakes = \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\).

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is **76**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

3. **Determine the cost per dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $4800.
   - Therefore, the cost per dozen cups is $4800 / 20 = $240.

4. **Calculate the cost per cup:**
   - Since one dozen equals 12 cups, the cost per cup is $240 / 12 = $20.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.

Now, let's consider the money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn.
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so her total earnings from mowing the lawn are \(4x\) dollars.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money Sara has before she mows the lawn is \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars. To find out how much more money she needs to afford the jacket and shoes, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

This $40 is the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn. Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4x = 40 \]
Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. The number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The eggs produced by the red chickens and the white chickens can be expressed as:
- Red chickens produce \( 3r \) eggs a day.
- White chickens produce \( 5w \) eggs a day.

Since the total number of eggs collected each day is 42, we can write the equation:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has \( r = 4 \) red chickens. To verify, if \( r = 4 \), then \( w = r + 2 = 6 \). The total number of eggs produced would be:
\[ 3 \times 4 + 5 \times 6 = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

This confirms our solution is correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a constant speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends \(\boxed{5}\) hours walking."
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers on the first day.
   - Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day.

2. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
   - The second day had 50 more customers than the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is \(100 + 50 = 150\).

3. Let the number of customers on the third day be \(x\).

4. According to the problem, the total number of customers over the three days is 500.
   - This can be expressed as the sum of the customers from each day: \(100 + 150 + x = 500\).

5. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   x = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   x = 250
   \]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of roses in the vase.
2. Calculate the number of dahlias in the vase.
3. Add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers.

Step 1: Identify the number of roses.
The problem states there are 4 roses in the vase.

Step 2: Calculate the number of dahlias.
The problem states there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Since there are 4 roses, the number of dahlias is:
\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Step 3: Add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers.
The total number of flowers is the sum of the roses and the dahlias:
\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, calculate Yuri's points:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri scored 10 more than this: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Next, calculate Brianna's points:
- Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

To find Jojo's points, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
- Total points: 251
- Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)

So, Jojo's points are:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Jojo scored 54 points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent solving puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on Sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, we calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one Sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 Sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on Sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles to find the total time spent:
- Total time spent = time on crossword puzzles + time on Sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is \(\boxed{70}\) minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank to water her garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount of what was left in the tank. Since 30 liters were left, the amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. Adding the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is \(\boxed{90}\) liters."
"First, let's determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, the number of petunias is:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

Next, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:

\[ 90 + 50 = 140 \]

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, it spends a third of $15000 on advertising, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising in the second year. To find the total amount spent on advertising over the two years, we add the amounts spent each year:

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To determine the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the total cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the total cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of Pokemon card James has after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 (initial) + 14 (bought) = 34
- Water type: 40 (initial) - 8 (lost) = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has now:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. This is calculated by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{3200}{96} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest integer, we get:

"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate their combined rate:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = \text{Kalinda's rate} + \text{Mom's rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

**Final Answer:**
1"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps and calculate the number of watermelons at each stage.

1. **Initial number of watermelons**: 120

2. **Watermelons ready for harvest after two months**: 30% of 120
   \[
   0.30 \times 120 = 36
   \]
   So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

3. **Remaining watermelons after two months**: 
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]

4. **Watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks**: 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63
   \]
   So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

5. **Remaining watermelons after harvesting**: 
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To determine the total cost Mark pays for the fleet of cars, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees for each car.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \text{ cars} \times \$20,000 \text{ per car} = \$240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**
   \[
   \text{Tax} = 10\% \text{ of } \$240,000 = 0.10 \times \$240,000 = \$24,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total registration fee:**
   \[
   \text{Registration fee per car} = \$1,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total registration fee} = 12 \text{ cars} \times \$1,000 \text{ per car} = \$12,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost including tax and registration fees:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of cars} + \text{Tax} + \text{Total registration fee}

"To solve this problem, we start by determining how many penguins jump in the ocean and how many go into the cave.

1. **Total number of penguins**: 36

2. **Penguins that jump in the ocean**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

3. **Penguins that go into the cave**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

4. **Penguins still sunbathing**:
   \[
   36 - 12 - 12 = 12
   \]

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's determine how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tomatoes Steve and his girlfriend eat together per day:

\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week:

\[ 9 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is:

\[ \frac{63}{3} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs \(\boxed{21}\) vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

First, we calculate the total number of slices needed. John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order \(\boxed{10}\) pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   Ram buys 25 pens. These are all full pens.

2. **First Cycle of Refilling:**
   - When Ram uses up the ink in these 25 pens, he will have 25 empty pens.
   - By mixing the ink from 5 empty pens, he can make 1 full pen. Therefore, from 25 empty pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) full pens.
   - After making these 5 new full pens, he will have 20 empty pens left (since he used 25 empty pens to make 5 new full pens).

3. **Second Cycle of Refilling:**
   - Now, Ram has 5 new full pens and 20 empty pens, making a total of 25 pens.
   - Using these 25 pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) more full pens.
   - After making these 5 new full pens, he will have 20 empty pens left again.

4. **Third Cycle of Refilling:**
   - Now, Ram has 5 new full pens and 20 empty pens, making a total of 25 pens.
   - Using these 25 pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) more full pens.
   - After making these 5 new full pens, he will have 20 empty pens left again.

5. **Fourth Cycle of Refilling:**
   - Now, Ram has 5 new full pens and 20 empty pens, making a total of 25 pens.
   - Using these 25 pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) more full pens.
   - After making these 5 new full pens, he will have 20 empty pens left again.

6. **Fifth Cycle of Refilling:**
   - Now, Ram has 5 new full pens and 20 empty pens, making a total of 25 pens.
   - Using these 25 pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) more full pens.
   - After making these 5 new full pens, he will have 20 empty pens left again.

At this point, Ram will have 25 full pens and 20 empty pens. Since he cannot make any more full pens with 20 empty pens (as he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen), the process stops here.

Adding up all the full pens he has:
- Initial purchase: 25 pens
- First cycle: 5 pens
- Second cycle: 5 pens
- Third cycle: 5 pens
- Fourth cycle: 5 pens
- Fifth cycle: 5 pens

Total number of pens = \( 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 50 \)

Thus, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is \(\boxed{50}\)."

2. Joan is five years older than Jessa. Therefore, Joan's age is:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan. Therefore, Mary's age is:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we sum the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:
\[
23 + 25 + 20 = 68
\]

Thus, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Determine the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Determine the number of students who went out through exit C by subtracting the students who went out through exits A and B from the total number of students.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit A} = 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. **Determine the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

4. **Determine the number of students who went out through exit C:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit C} = \text{Remaining students} - \text{Students who went out through exit B} = 700 - 420 = 280
   \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

1. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).
2. According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert. Since John has 54 candies, we can write:
   \[
   2R = 54
   \]
3. Solving for \( R \):
   \[
   R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]
   So, Robert has 27 candies.
4. James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, the number of candies James has is:
   \[
   R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
   \]
5. Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies, so the difference is:
   \[
   54 - 33 = 21
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}

"To determine the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora, we need to consider the books each of them reads.

1. Dolly has two books. If Dolly reads her own two books and also reads Pandora's one book, she will read a total of:
   \[
   2 \text{ (her own books)} + 1 \text{ (Pandora's book)} = 3 \text{ books}
   \]

2. Pandora has one book. If Pandora reads her own book and also reads Dolly's two books, she will read a total of:
   \[
   1 \text{ (her own book)} + 2 \text{ (Dolly's books)} = 3 \text{ books}
   \]

3. To find the total number of books read collectively, we add the number of books read by Dolly and the number of books read by Pandora:
   \[
   3 \text{ (Dolly's total)} + 3 \text{ (Pandora's total)} = 6 \text{ books}

Thus, by the end, they will collectively read a total of 6 books."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike is still writing to:**
   Mike originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Therefore, he is still writing to:
   \[
   5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of letters Mike receives per week:**
   Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week. Therefore, the total number of letters Mike receives per week is:
   \[
   3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} = 6 \text{ letters per week}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of pages Mike needs to write in response:**
   Each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike needs to write in response is:
   \[
   6 \text{ letters} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages per week}
   \]

4. **Calculate the time Mike spends writing per page:**
   Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing 30 pages is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Convert the total writing time from minutes to hours:**
   There are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, the total time in hours is:
   \[
   \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries Griffin had at each stage and how many fries Ginger gave him.

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries.
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 24 - 5 = 19
   \]

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 19 - 10 = 9
   \]

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \(x\) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   9 + x \text{ fries}
   \]

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x
   \]

6. **Final number of fries Griffin had:**
   We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries.
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]

7. **Solving for \(x\):**
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin \(\boxed{20}\) fries."

"First, let's determine the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood tree:

\[
\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:

\[
20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood. Therefore, the weight of the wood that was eaten is:

\[
0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

The remaining weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:

   - We know that 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies.
   - Therefore, the amount of flour needed per cookie is \(\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ cups per cookie}\).
   - For 66 cookies, the amount of flour needed is \(66 \times \frac{1}{6} = 11\) cups.

So, Carla will need \(\boxed{11}\) cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of pennies in two-thirds of the cup.
2. Convert the number of pennies to dollars.

First, calculate two-thirds of 9,300 pennies:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]
So, two-thirds of the pennies in the cup is 6,200 pennies.

Next, convert 6,200 pennies to dollars. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar:
\[
\frac{6200}{100} = 62
\]
Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup is \(\boxed{62}\)."

"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand. We subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, the number of trees in Harry's yard that are more than in Ferdinand's yard is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"

So, the total amount of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined is \(\boxed{400}\)."
"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
   \]

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the house:**
   The total cost is the sum of the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500
   \]

4. **Determine how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:**
   Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500
   \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the selling price, the transfer fees, the brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 3\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = \$12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = \$20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total deductions:**
   \[
   \text{Total deductions} = \text{Transfer fees} + \text{Brokerage fee} = \$12,000 + \$20,000 = \$32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Total deductions} - \text{Remaining loan amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = \$400,000 - \$32,000 - \$250,000 = \$118,000
   \]

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:
\[
\boxed{118000}

"To determine the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to break down the problem into several steps and calculate the time for each step.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Time taken: 20 minutes

2. **Heating the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees:**
   - The time taken is 40% longer than the time to heat from room temperature to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - The time taken is 5 minutes less than the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - Therefore, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Sum of all the times: \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

Thus, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is \(\boxed{71}\) minutes."
"To determine the total amount spent by the real estate agent on the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- The agent bought 50 newspaper ads.

\[
\text{Cost of newspaper ads} = 50 \text{ ads} \times 5 \text{ dollars/ad} = 250 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- The agent bought 15 television ads.

\[
\text{Cost of television ads} = 15 \text{ ads} \times 75 \text{ dollars/ad} = 1125 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms from all three bags to find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought:

\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is \(\boxed{762}\)."
"To determine the total number of windows between the houses, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms per house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 6 \text{ windows/house} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Calculate the number of additional windows in each house:**
   - Each house has 4 additional windows.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows/house} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Calculate the total number of windows:**
   - The total number of windows is the sum of the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows.
   - Therefore, the total number of windows is \(12 \text{ windows} + 8 \text{ windows} = 20 \text{ windows}\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we need to break down the total number of stitches and allocate them according to the given information.

1. **Body of the sweater**: 900 stitches.
2. **Collar**: Takes a tenth of the body's stitches.
   \[
   \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches}
   \]
3. **Rosette**: Takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches}
   \]

Next, we sum the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette to find out how many stitches are used for these parts:
\[
\text{Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \text{ stitches}
\]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches used for the sleeves is:
\[
\text{Stitches for sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches}
\]

Since the sweater has two sleeves, we divide the total sleeve stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:
\[
\text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches}
\]

Thus, each sleeve takes \(\boxed{315}\) stitches."

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part of the production and then sum them up.

1. **Lyrics to the Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
     - Solo song: 54 lines
     - First scene: 36 lines
     - Second scene: 48 lines
   - Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\).

Thus, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is \(\boxed{138}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the small holes. Since it takes him 3 minutes to dig one small hole, for 30 small holes, the time spent is:

\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time spent digging the large holes. Since it takes him 10 minutes to dig one large hole, for 15 large holes, the time spent is:

\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both small and large holes to get the total time in minutes:

\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 20 + 20 = 40.

**Final Answer:**
40"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 3S = 18 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Sam is 6 years old."

- Therefore, the total cost for the popsicles is \( 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream bars is \( 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the total cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:

"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate Izzy's medals as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we find the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals of Ali and Izzy} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 39 = \frac{x}{10} \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ bars/packet} = 40 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars/adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. So, each child will get:
\[ \frac{16 \text{ bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bars/child} \]

Therefore, each child will get:
\[ 2 \text{ bars} \]"
"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Susan works.
2. Determine how much she earns per minute.
3. Calculate her total earnings based on the working time.

First, let's find out the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. but takes a half-hour break. The total time from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is 3 hours. Subtracting the half-hour break, the actual working time is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes:
\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know that Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes. To find out how much she earns per minute, we divide $5 by 10:
\[ \frac{5 \text{ dollars}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.50 \text{ dollars/minute} \]

To find her total earnings, we multiply her earnings per minute by the total number of minutes she worked:
\[ 0.50 \text{ dollars/minute} \times 150 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Susan earns is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"Let's break down the points for each player after the first three rounds and then add the extra points from the fourth round.

1. **Initial Points After Three Rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.
   - Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike: 22 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 43 points

Adding these together, the total points for all three players is:
\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

So, the final total points after the extra points had been distributed is:
\[
\boxed{83}

"To determine how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the ages of the sons.
2. Calculate the number of oranges each son washes.
3. Subtract the total number of washed oranges from the total number of oranges Will bought.

First, let's identify the ages of the sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate the number of oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes 4 oranges.

Now, we find the total number of oranges washed:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will bought 15 oranges in total. Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"Let's break down the activities Darren did on each day and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total for each type of exercise over the two days:

**Total Pushups:**
100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220

**Total Squats:**
50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90

**Total Dumbbell presses:**
20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

Finally, we sum up all the activities:
220 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = 370

So, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is **370**."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily rice consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner).
   - Therefore, each person consumes \(0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day}\).
   - For 5 people, the total daily consumption is \(0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 2 \, \text{kg/day}\).

2. **Calculate the total weekly rice consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly consumption is \(2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week}\).

3. **Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - The total amount of rice is 42 kg.
   - The weekly consumption is 14 kg.
   - Therefore, the number of weeks the rice will last is \(\frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Monday: Closed (0 crates)
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Friday: Closed (0 crates)
- Saturday: 20 crates
- Sunday: 20 crates

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Sunday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 + 20 = 85 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 85 = 35 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by \(\boxed{35}\) crates from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sequence of bids and sum them up.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen accepts the opening bid of $200.
2. **First Other Bidder**: The bid rises by $50, so the first other bidder bids $200 + $50 = $250.
3. **Carmen's First Bid**: Carmen bids $250 + $50 = $300.
4. **Second Other Bidder**: The bid rises by another $50, so the second other bidder bids $300 + $50 = $350.
5. **Carmen's Second Bid**: Carmen bids $350 + $50 = $400.
6. **Third Other Bidder**: The bid rises by another $50, so the third other bidder bids $400 + $50 = $450.
7. **Carmen's Final Bid**: Carmen bids $450 + $50 = $500 and wins the auction.

Now, we sum up all the bids Carmen made:
- First bid: $300
- Second bid: $400
- Final bid: $500

Total cost = $300 + $400 + $500 = $1200

Thus, the desk costs Carmen \(\boxed{1200}\) dollars."
"To calculate the total annual cost for John's driving service, we need to break down the costs into several components and then sum them up.

1. **Daily Miles Driven:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so he drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, totaling 60 miles per day.

2. **Weekly Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 60 miles per day and works 5 days a week, so he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles per week.

3. **Annual Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 300 miles per week and works for 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles per year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - John is charged $2 per mile. Therefore, the cost for the miles driven in a year is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total annual bonus is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

6. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Adding the cost for the miles driven and the annual bonus, the total annual cost is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is **$31,800**."
"To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

Adding these together:
\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time from Monday and Sunday by 2:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the folding process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, can produce two pages (one on the front and one on the back).

Given that a 32-page tabloid is made by folding a piece of paper in half, we can deduce the following:
- The first fold will produce 2 pages.
- The second fold will produce 4 pages.
- The third fold will produce 8 pages.
- The fourth fold will produce 16 pages.
- The fifth fold will produce 32 pages.

Since each fold doubles the number of pages, and we need 32 pages, we need to fold the paper 5 times. Each fold uses one piece of paper. Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used is equal to the number of folds.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the amount left after the rides is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annika has left is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Let's break down the information given and calculate the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year.

1. **Total books in the collection**: 250 books.
2. **Books sold this year**: 45 books.
3. **Books remaining unsold**: 50 books.
4. **Books sold in the first year**: Since there are 50 unsold books now and 45 sold this year, the number of books sold in the first year is \(250 - 50 - 45 = 155\) books.
5. **Books sold in the first year compared to the current year**: The problem states that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. This is consistent with \(155 = 2 \times 45 - 5\), but we'll use the direct calculation for the second year.

Now, we need to find out how many books were sold in the second year. The total books sold over the three years is \(155 + \text{second year sales} + 45 = 250 - 50 = 200\). Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is \(200 - 155 - 45 = 0\).

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is \(0 \times 20 = 0\).

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is \(\boxed{0}\)."
"To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Watson's daily earnings:**
   - Watson works 10 hours a day.
   - He earns $10 per hour.
   - Daily earnings = 10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day.

2. **Calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - Weekly earnings from hourly wage = $100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week.

3. **Add the weekly bonus:**
   - Watson gets a $300 bonus each week.
   - Total weekly earnings = $500 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800/week.

4. **Determine the number of weeks in April:**
   - April typically has 4 weeks.

5. **Calculate Watson's total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings for April = $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200.

"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled a total of 20 people, the number of people he lost to is:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

This means that after the morning sales, the number of loaves left is:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Next, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon (and also in the evening) is:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Therefore, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, which is the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks.

Since Sandy loses weight at a rate that allows her to lose 2 pounds per 4 weeks, we can calculate the total weeks required for Sandy to lose 8 pounds as follows:

\[ \text{Total weeks for Sandy} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \times 2 = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 8 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:

- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Now, let's calculate the savings on the milk:

- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5

Next, we calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:

- Total savings on ice cream: 2 tubs * $2/tub = $4
- Total savings on milk: 4 packets * $0.5/packet = $2

Finally, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to get the total savings:

- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

So, you will save a total of $6."
"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is calculated by dividing 15 by 3:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is calculated by dividing 15 by 5:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (total new limbs)}
     \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"Let's break down Theo's expenses step by step.

1. **Cost of business suits:**
   Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
   \[
   6 \times 100 = 600
   \]
   So, the total cost for business suits is $600.

2. **Cost of suitcases:**
   Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150
   \]
   So, the total cost for suitcases is $150.

3. **Cost of the flight ticket:**
   The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100.
   \[
   5 \times 100 = 500
   \]
   Adding $700 to this amount:
   \[
   500 + 700 = 1200
   \]
   So, the total cost for the flight ticket is $1200.

4. **Total expenses so far:**
   Adding up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
   \[
   600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950
   \]

5. **Amount Theo wants to save:**
   Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip.

6. **Total amount Theo has:**
   Theo has $6000 initially.

7. **Amount left for gifts:**
   Subtract the total expenses and the amount Theo wants to save from the total amount he has:
   \[
   6000 - 1950 - 2000 = 2050

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20, so the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot 3D + 2 \cdot \frac{D}{2} = 2 \cdot 105 \]
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited to her party.

- She invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is:
\[12 + 12 = 24\]

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments.

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\]

Therefore, the number of people who actually show up is:
\[24 - 10 = 14\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Determine the cost to fill the pool based on the volume and the cost per cubic foot.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Determine the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost to fill the pool is the volume of the pool multiplied by the cost per cubic foot. The cost per cubic foot is $0.10.

\[ \text{Cost} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is \(\boxed{12}\)."

"Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \), which means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
3. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion based on the ratio:
   \[
   \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
4. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion:
   \[
   \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
5. Solving for \( P \):
   \[
   P = \frac{45}{3} = 15

\[ 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, the pen costs \(\boxed{1}\) dollar."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. This can be represented as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = 26 \]

Since the 2 loose pencils are part of the total, the number of pencils in the boxes is:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

So, Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils.

Next, we know that Meg has 46 pencils. To find out the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together, we add the number of pencils each has:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold the same number of pencils as the boxes Jam has (which is 24 pencils per box), we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{24} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid from the cream.

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon needs to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
   - The number of ice cubes required is \( \frac{65}{13} = 5 \) ice cubes.

2. **Effect on Coffee Strength:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the coffee becomes \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) milliliters weaker.

3. **Effect of Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - The cream further weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream.
   - Total weakening = 60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters.

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the trade ratio and the outcome of the trades.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

Since each new record requires 2 old records, for 7 new records, the total number of old records given up is:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the number of percentage points that need to be charged. The phone needs to go from 60% to 100%, which is a difference of:

\[ 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

Next, we know that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to find out how many minutes it will take to recharge 40 percentage points, we multiply the number of percentage points by the time it takes to recharge one percentage point:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone.

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

These 4 dollars in rewards can be used on the current shopping trip. The customer spent $43 on this trip and applied the rewards. However, there is a coupon that takes twice the amount of the rewards off the price. 

First, apply the rewards:
\[ \text{Price after rewards} = 43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, apply the coupon, which takes twice the amount of the rewards off the price:
\[ \text{Price after coupon} = 39 - (2 \times 4) = 39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid:

"To determine which job pays more net income, we need to calculate the net pay for both Job A and Job B.

**Job A:**
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Net pay: $30,000 - (20% of $30,000) = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Net pay: $36,000 - (10% of $36,000) = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Since the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the larger groups, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students in the class is 200, and the class is split into three groups. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To isolate \( x \), we add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

1. \( C + H = 60 \)
2. \( H = 2C \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to find the number of cows:

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting \( C \) back into the second equation:

\[ H = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, there are 20 cows and 40 chickens. Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

The total number of legs the animals have, all together, is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Josh starts by juggling 3 balls.
2. Each week, he adds 1 ball to his juggling act.
3. The talent show is 4 weeks away, so by the end of the fourth week, he will have added 4 balls in total (1 ball per week for 4 weeks).

So, the number of balls Josh can juggle by the end of the fourth week is:
\[ 3 \text{ (initial balls)} + 4 \text{ (balls added over 4 weeks)} = 7 \text{ balls} \]

4. During the performance, Josh drops 3 balls. Since 2 of them are caught and 1 is lost, he is left with:
\[ 7 \text{ (initial balls)} - 3 \text{ (dropped balls)} = 4 \text{ balls} \]

Therefore, the final number of balls Josh starts juggling on stage is:
\[ 4 \text{ balls} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad. Therefore, the blue beetle and the green toad each weigh 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Therefore, the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. Therefore, the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself. The weights of the animals are:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Adding these weights together, we get:
\[50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 \text{ pounds}\]

Including the weight of the container, which is 20 pounds, the total weight is:
\[240 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds}\]

First, we know that the school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. Therefore, the number of plant pots needed for the roses is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots needed:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:
\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine how much Andrea saved, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total amount of money Andrea had initially.
2. Subtract the amount she spent on the sweater.
3. Subtract the amount she gave to her brother.
4. The result will be the amount she saved.

Let's go through the calculations step by step:

1. Andrea initially had $36.
2. She spent $11 on a sweater. So, the remaining amount after buying the sweater is:
   \[
   36 - 11 = 25
   \]
3. She then gave her brother $4. So, the remaining amount after giving her brother money is:
   \[
   25 - 4 = 21
   \]

Therefore, the amount Andrea saved is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"First, let's break down the time John spent on each activity:

1. **Boating**: John spent 6 hours boating.
2. **Swimming**: He spent half the time he spent boating swimming, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.
3. **Watching Shows**: He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours watching shows.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add her initial savings and the earnings from both jobs to find out how much money she has in total:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the phone is $400. To find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount of money she has from the cost of the phone:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the height of the shortest tree.
2. Calculate the height of the second tree.
3. Find the combined height of the shortest and second trees.
4. Determine the height of the tallest tree based on the combined height.

Step 1: The height of the shortest tree is given as 6 feet.

Step 2: The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree. Therefore, the height of the second tree is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Step 3: The combined height of the shortest and second trees is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet} \]

Step 4: The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees. Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ 2 \times 17 \text{ feet} = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height of the tallest tree is \(\boxed{34}\) feet."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean started with $28. After spending $17, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we will subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of mini-golf} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one person} = \$5 + \$20 = \$25
   \]

4. **Cost for Morgan herself:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Morgan} = \$25
   \]

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Morgan and friends} = \text{Cost for Morgan} + \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for each friend (excluding arcade tokens, as Morgan already has $5 for herself):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for each friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost for each friend}} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4
   \]

Since Morgan cannot invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. Therefore, the total cost of lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa has left after buying the lollipops each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the amount she saves each day is:

\[ \$5 - \$1 = \$4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. If she saves $4 each day, then over 5 days, she will save:

\[ \$4 \text{ per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = \$20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount Billy spent on gumballs:**
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Total cost for gumballs = \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the amount of money Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy spent $2 on gumballs.
   - Let \( C \) be the amount of money he had before buying gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( C - 2 = \text{change after buying gumballs} \).

3. **Determine the amount of change Billy had after buying gumballs:**
   - Billy initially had $10.
   - After buying candy, he had some change.
   - He spent half of this change on gumballs, which means the change before buying gumballs was \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the amount spent on candy = \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the amount of candy Billy bought:**
   - The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
   - Amount of candy bought = \( \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \) pounds.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver is 45 years old, which is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is \(\boxed{25}\) years old."
"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it takes to reach 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by the daily distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

Therefore, the train needs service every 20 days. The final answer is:
\[\boxed{20}\]"
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. According to the problem, a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

\[
3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing required:

\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:

\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each segment of the trip and then sum these times.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Distance: 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add the times for both segments to get the total time:

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the current points of Sara and Erin.
2. Determine Erin's points before the recent score.

First, we know that Sara currently has 8 points. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Erin's current points:

\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

This means that after scoring 14 points, Erin has 24 points. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring these 14 points, we subtract 14 from her current points:

\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, Erin had \(\boxed{10}\) points before scoring 14 points."

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest on the loan. The interest rate is 10% per year, and the loan period is five months. Since the interest rate is annual, we need to find the interest for five months.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% per year or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5/12 of a year (since 5 months is 5/12 of a year).

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.0835 \]

So, the total interest for five months is approximately $152.08. Now, we add this interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan has to pay after five months.

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.08 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.08 \]

Karan has to pay this total amount over five months, so we divide the total amount by 5 to find the monthly payment.

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.416 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is $760.42.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's hiking speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance Cho hiked} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's hiking speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance Cho hiked} - \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Axel has 50 silver pesos. Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos. Since Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

- The total number of silver pesos they have together is \(50 + 100 = 150\).
- The total number of gold pesos they have together is \(80 + 120 = 200\).

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the overall total number of pesos.

- The total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

Thus, the total number of pesos they have together is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling 36 cups is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the total cost of the supplies. The cost is given as $18. Therefore, the profit from selling all the lemonade is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can sell all 36 cups in:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The profit per hour is the total profit divided by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To determine how much land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.
2. According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.
3. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
   \]
5. Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
   \]

So, Mr. Ruther originally had \(\boxed{32}\) hectares of land."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26 \]

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform.

On the day of the performance, half of the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his five test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

"To determine how much money David saves, we need to compare the cost of buying ride tickets individually versus buying a ride bracelet.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha, who buys tickets for each ride:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets.
- There are 9 rides.
- Each ticket costs $2.

The total number of tickets Dasha needs is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ tickets/ride} = 18 \text{ tickets} \]

The total cost for Dasha's tickets is:
\[ 18 \text{ tickets} \times \$2/\text{ticket} = \$36 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

The total cost for David is:
\[ \$30 \]

Now, we compare the costs:
- Dasha's total cost: \$36
- David's total cost: \$30

The amount of money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of individual tickets is:
\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

- Gifts for her teachers: 2

Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to make a bow for each of the 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[ \text{Inches of ribbon per bow} = \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per bow} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means that the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost without the bundle discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate the discount Tim gets by bundling these services. The bundle discount is 20%, so the cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 \times (1 - 0.20) = 30 \times 0.80 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable subscription, which is $60 per month. The amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription and getting the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, he will use the air conditioner for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:

So, the total cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, so for 4 magnets, the cost is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how much Tim spent in total, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks.
2. Calculate the total cost of the fireworks before the discount.
3. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the fireworks.
4. Add the cost of the finale firework to the discounted total cost of the fireworks.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The cost of the first pack of fireworks is $400. The second pack costs twice that much:
   \[
   2 \times 400 = 800
   \]

2. The total cost of the fireworks before the discount is the sum of the costs of the two packs:
   \[
   400 + 800 = 1200
   \]

3. Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:
   \[
   0.20 \times 1200 = 240
   \]
   Subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks:
   \[
   1200 - 240 = 960
   \]

4. Finally, add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total cost of the fireworks:
   \[
   960 + 150 = 1110
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:
\[
\boxed{1110}
\]"
"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days:**
   Shannon eats 2 cookies each night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
   \[
   2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Convert the total number of cookies into dozens:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of madeleine cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of candles that are more dangerous:**
   - Marcy markets her candles as 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles are more dangerous and have a higher risk of exploding.
   - If she makes 50,000 candles, the number of more dangerous candles is:
     \[
     50,000 \times 0.01 = 500
     \]

2. **Determine the number of more dangerous candles that also have a defect:**
   - 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
   - Therefore, the number of more dangerous candles that smell like wet dog is:
     \[
     500 \times 0.05 = 25
     \]

3. **Determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode:**
   - Since the problem does not specify that the defect (smelling like wet dog) affects the explosion rate, we assume that the defect does not change the explosion rate of the more dangerous candles.
   - Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is the same as the number of more dangerous candles that have the defect, which is 25.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picks.

First, let's find the discount price of one blouse. The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. This means each blouse is now 70% of its original price (since 100% - 30% = 70%).

The discount price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses. Since each blouse costs $14 after the discount, the total cost for 4 blouses is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Apples gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: Let's denote this as \( x \) apples.

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples (since she doesn't take any from the average trees).

3. **Total apples gathered by both:**
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne: \( 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \).
   - Total apples gathered by her sister: \( 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \).
   - Combined total: \( 45 + x + 105 = 150 + x \).

4. **Given that the combined total is 500 apples:**
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 500 - 150 = 350
   \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{350}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of camels.
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, we can write:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. The total number of humps is 304. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we can write:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
c + d = 180 \\
2c + d = 304
\end{cases}
\]

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
\[
2c + d - c - d = 124
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
\[
d = 180 - 124
\]
\[
d = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each segment of the trip and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \).

3. **The 7th day:**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the 7th day: \( 0 \, \text{km} \).

4. **Second week (days 8 to 14):**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[
800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km}
\]

Thus, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[
\boxed{3140}

"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the elevation of Stanley's comb.
2. Identify the elevation of Oliver.
3. Calculate the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

First, Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge 4,000 feet below. Therefore, the elevation of the comb is:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Mr. Josue received from the second bank.
2. Add the amounts received from both banks to the initial capital he had.

First, we know that the first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts received from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and each carried away 5 cats. So, the total number of cats carried away is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
3. After the boats took away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).
4. Then, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).
5. After 18 cats ran after the mouse, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

So, the final number of cats left on the rock is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the costs based on the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years total 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Now, we add up all these costs:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256
\]

The total cost for 2 years of the service is \(\$256\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations. Let \( S_{tattered} \) be the savings from the tattered jeans and \( S_{jogger} \) be the savings from the jogger jeans. We know:
\[ S_{tattered} + S_{jogger} = 6 \]
\[ S_{jogger} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_{tattered} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price. Let \( P_{tattered} \) be the original price of the tattered jeans. The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and the savings is $4, so:
\[ P_{tattered} - 28 = 4 \]
\[ P_{tattered} = 32 \]

Similarly, the savings from the jogger jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price. Let \( P_{jogger} \) be the original price of the jogger jeans. The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and the savings is $2, so:
\[ P_{jogger} - 22 = 2 \]
\[ P_{jogger} = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:
\[ P_{jogger} - P_{tattered} = 24 - 32 = -8 \]

Since the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, and the result is negative, it means the tattered jeans originally cost more. The absolute value of the difference is:
\[ 32 - 24 = 8 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

   - Number of minivans: 10
   - Capacity per minivan: 15 employees
   - Total capacity for minivans: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) employees

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:

\[
240 \text{ (buses)} + 180 \text{ (minibusses)} + 150 \text{ (minivans)} = 570 \text{ employees}

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is \(\boxed{570}\)."
"To determine how many birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bird feeders:**
   - Lillian builds 3 bird feeders.
   - Lillian buys 3 bird feeders.
   - Total bird feeders = 3 (built) + 3 (bought) = 6 bird feeders.

2. **Determine the number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:**
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought feeder.
   - Therefore, each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

3. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:**
   - There are 3 store-bought feeders.
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Total birds from store-bought feeders = 3 × 20 = 60 birds.

4. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:**
   - There are 3 homemade feeders.
   - Each homemade feeder attracts 30 birds.
   - Total birds from homemade feeders = 3 × 30 = 90 birds.

5. **Calculate the total number of birds in the garden:**
   - Total birds = Birds from store-bought feeders + Birds from homemade feeders
   - Total birds = 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see \(\boxed{150}\) birds in her garden each day."
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel:**
   The bagel costs $4.

2. **Cost of the soup:**
   The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. First, we calculate 25% of the bagel's cost:
   \[
   0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5
   \]

3. **Cost of the cake:**
   The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, we calculate half of the bagel's cost:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

4. **Total cost:**
   Now, we sum the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
   \[
   5 + 4 + 2 = 11
   \]

Thus, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the ticket and have $50 in spending cash:**
   \[
   \text{Total money needed} = \$100 + \$50 = \$150
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of cards Kenny needs to sell to make $150, given that each card is sold for $1.5:**
   \[
   \text{Number of cards} = \frac{\$150}{\$1.5} = 100 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Understand that Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and sells the rest:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he keeps \( \frac{x}{3} \) cards.
   - He sells the remaining 2/3 of the cards, which is \( \frac{2x}{3} \).

4. **Since the number of cards he sells is equal to the number of cards calculated in step 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 100
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   2x = 100 \times 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 300
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]

So, Kenny started with **150 cards**."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, 18 guests would get 2 hotdogs each, and the other 18 guests would get 1 hotdog each.

2. **Total Hotdogs Prepared:**
   - Hotdogs for the 18 guests who get 2 each: \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
   - Hotdogs for the 18 guests who get 1 each: \(18 \times 1 = 18\) hotdogs.
   - Total hotdogs prepared: \(36 + 18 = 54\) hotdogs.

3. **Actual Guests and Demand:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog.
   - This means each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs in total.

4. **Total Hotdogs Needed:**
   - Total hotdogs needed for 40 guests, each wanting 2: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) hotdogs.

5. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - Hotdogs prepared: 54
   - Hotdogs needed: 80
   - Shortage: \(80 - 54 = 26\) hotdogs.

6. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since 26 hotdogs are short, 26 out of the 40 guests will not get a second hotdog.

**Final Answer:**
26 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. According to the problem, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Adding 4 more letters to this half:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

So, her sister's name has 7 letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final amount for Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"

Amount needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Amount needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's determine how much gas each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gas Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, she needs:

\[ 3 \text{ gallons} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of money George had left after buying the chips:**
   - George spent $5 in total.
   - He had 1% of his money left after buying 3 bags of chips.
   - Let's denote the total amount of money George had initially as \( M \).
   - Since he had 1% of his money left, the amount of money he spent is 99% of \( M \).
   - Therefore, \( 0.99M = 5 \).

2. **Solve for \( M \):**
   \[
   M = \frac{5}{0.99} \approx 5.0505 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   For simplicity, we can round \( M \) to $5.05 (since the problem involves cents, this approximation is reasonable).

3. **Calculate the amount spent on chips:**
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40.
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - The total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the amount spent on candy bars:**
   - George spent a total of $5.
   - He spent $1.20 on chips.
   - Therefore, the amount spent on candy bars is \( 5.05 - 1.20 = 3.85 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the number of candy bars bought:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75.
   - The number of candy bars bought is \( \frac{3.85}{0.75} \approx 5.1333 \).
   - Since George cannot buy a fraction of a candy bar, he bought 5 candy bars.

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray originally had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many lollipops each of his four friends received. Since the 20 lollipops were shared equally among his four friends, we divide 20 by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of Ray's friends received \(\boxed{5}\) lollipops."
"Rory's cake initially weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. When Rory and her mom each have a piece, 2 pieces are taken. Since each piece is \(\frac{20}{8} = 2.5\) ounces, the total weight of the two pieces they have is \(2 \times 2.5 = 5\) ounces.

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The cost of the onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for the onions is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Bernadette to be driven to the theater. According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, the drive for Bernadette will take:

\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, which means she needs to arrive 9 minutes before Wayne starts his journey. Therefore, Bernadette needs to leave 9 minutes earlier than Wayne to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before Wayne.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room in feet. We know the area of the room and the length, and we need to convert the length from yards to feet since 1 yard = 3 feet.

1. Convert the length from yards to feet:
   \[
   \text{Length} = 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. Use the area formula for a rectangle (Area = Length × Width) to find the width:
   \[
   \text{Area} = 360 \text{ square feet} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width}
   \]
   Solving for the width:
   \[
   \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. Now, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula for the perimeter (Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)):
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet}
   \]

The perimeter of the room is \(\boxed{98}\) feet."

\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

1. Convert 30 minutes to hours: \( \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \).

2. Calculate the distance the horse runs: \( 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats for 16 miles. Since the horse eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) a bail of hay per mile:

3. Calculate the total hay consumed: \( 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \).

Now, we need to determine the cost of 8 bails of hay. Each bail of hay costs $3:

"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers and then subtract the initial cost of the case.

1. **Calculate the cost per sneaker:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\text{Total cost of the case}}{\text{Number of sneakers in the case}} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from the flash sale:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} \times \text{Price per sneaker at flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sneakers sold to the department store} = \text{Total number of sneakers} - \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} = 48 - 17 = 31
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = \text{Number of sneakers sold to the department store} \times \text{Price per sneaker to the department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of the super ticket and additional items:**
   - Super ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost of a regular ticket and additional items:**
   - Regular ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.
   - So, we can set up the equation: $21 - $2 = $15 + \( P \)

4. **Solve for \( P \):**
   \[
   21 - 2 = 15 + P
   \]
   \[
   19 = 15 + P

"First, let's determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We do this by multiplying the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
\]

Calculating each term separately:

\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]
\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]

Adding these together:

\[
10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

Thus, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[
\boxed{11050}

   - Total distance = Distance of first part + Distance of second part = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

4. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time of first part + Time of second part = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

5. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during the trip is **50 mph**."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she is left with:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of her 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we sum up all the cards to find the total number of cards:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards is:

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of puppies.
2. Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.
3. Determine the percentage of puppies with spots.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of puppies.**

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.**

Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

**Step 3: Determine the percentage of puppies with spots.**

The percentage of puppies with spots is calculated by dividing the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies, and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = \( 42 \times 75 = 3150 \) pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = \( 20 \times 65 = 1300 \) pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - The farmer buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
\[ 3150 \text{ (hay)} + 1300 \text{ (oats)} + 48 \text{ (carrots)} + 2 \text{ (sugar cubes)} = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip would still require a full trip to transport the remaining feed).

\[ \frac{4500}{2250} = 2 \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings first and then multiply by four.

1. Calculate the weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
   - Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
   - Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
   - Weekly earnings from aluminum cans = \(3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week}\).

2. Calculate the weekly earnings from plastic bottles:

"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since a negative position doesn't make sense in this context, we interpret this as moving from 1st to 6th place (since she can't be in a negative position, she moves down to 6th).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(6 + 2 = 8\). So, she is now in 8th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(8 - 3 = 5\). So, she is now in 5th place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(5 + 1 = 6\). So, she is now in 6th place.

Therefore, Finley finished the race in 6th place. 

Final answer:

A 10 percent discount on $10 is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, after the 10 percent discount, Kelly paid:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[ 9 - 8 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, Kelly paid \(\boxed{1}\) dollar more than Becky."
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforter per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, we sum up the total number of laundry items per room:
\[ 2 \text{ (sheets)} + 1 \text{ (comforter)} + 4 \text{ (pillow cases)} + 8 \text{ (towels)} = 15 \text{ pieces of laundry per room} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces of laundry for 80 rooms:
\[ 15 \text{ pieces/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 1200 \text{ pieces of laundry} \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday.

1. **Initial number of shoes**: Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Shoes added on Monday**: He gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he gets \(5 \times 2 = 10\) shoes.
   \[
   200 + 10 = 210 \text{ shoes}
   \]

3. **Shoes added on Wednesday**: He gains 15 new pairs of shoes on Wednesday. Each pair consists of 2 shoes, so he gets \(15 \times 2 = 30\) shoes.
   \[
   210 + 30 = 240 \text{ shoes}
   \]

4. **Shoes added on Friday**: He gains 30 pairs of shoes on Friday. Each pair consists of 2 shoes, so he gets \(30 \times 2 = 60\) shoes.
   \[
   240 + 60 = 300 \text{ shoes}
   \]

5. **Shoes removed on Saturday**: He gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.
   \[
   300 - 180 = 120 \text{ shoes}
   \]

So, the number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, we calculate the total number of cupcakes as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes/pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

Therefore, Mary should bake \(\boxed{4}\) pans worth of cupcakes."
"First, let's determine the cost of the piece of paper. The pen costs $2. The piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. So, we calculate three times the price of the pen:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Then, we subtract $1 from this amount to find the cost of the piece of paper:

\[ 6 - 1 = 5 \]

Now, we add the cost of the pen and the piece of paper to find the total cost of the items Theo bought:

\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \]

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the amount of change Theo received, we subtract the total cost of the items from the $10 she gave:

\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of pencils initially:**
   - There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils.
   - Total pencils = \( 30 \times 10 = 300 \).

2. **Determine the number of pencils used after two months:**
   - After two months, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total pencils were used.
   - Pencils used = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \).

3. **Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months:**
   - Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used
   - Remaining pencils = \( 300 - 60 = 240 \).

4. **Determine the number of pencils left at the end of the year:**
   - At the end of the year, \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining pencils were left.
   - Pencils left = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \).

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed by the equation:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate \( \frac{x}{2} \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"First, let's calculate the combined length of the two remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, so two remoras would be:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to convert the shark's body length from feet to inches to make the units consistent. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, a 10-foot shark is:

\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. This is calculated by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the shark's body length and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10\% \]"
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the following equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine how long Jason needs to walk each day, we first need to calculate the total number of days he will be walking over the three weeks.

Since there are 7 days in a week, over three weeks, Jason will have:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Jason plans to walk 4 days a week. Over three weeks, he will walk:
\[ 4 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ days} \]

The total time he needs to walk is 240 minutes. To find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total time by the number of days he will be walking:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

So, Jason has to spend \(\boxed{20}\) minutes walking each day."
"To determine how many books each child received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Sarah bought.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of kids.

First, we find out how many books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we divide $300 by $15:

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of kids. Sarah has 4 kids, so we divide 20 by 4:

\[
\text{Number of books per child} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Therefore, each child received \(\boxed{5}\) books."
"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to either dairy or peanuts is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides.

1. Calculate the total number of employees:

"To determine the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay, then sum these amounts.

1. **Plane Tickets Cost:**
   - Each plane ticket costs $5000.
   - Since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
     \[
     5000 \times 2 = 10000
     \]

2. **Hotel Cost:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive because it is a busy weekend.
   - First, calculate the increased price per day:
     \[
     1500 \times 0.20 = 300
     \]
   - Add this increase to the normal price:
     \[
     1500 + 300 = 1800
     \]
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total hotel cost is:
     \[
     1800 \times 3 = 5400
     \]

3. **Total Cost of the Trip:**
   - Add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay:

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we start by determining the weight of each penny.

1. The weight of the 1959 penny is given as 48 grains.
2. The 2010 penny weighs three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Therefore, we calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:
   \[
   \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} = 36 \text{ grains}
   \]

Next, we add the weights of both pennies to find the combined weight:
\[
\text{Combined weight} = \text{Weight of 1959 penny} + \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains}

"To determine how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first calculate the total amount they have already earned. Keegan earned $83 and Tasha earned $91. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 83 + 91 = 174 \]

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they have already earned from their goal:

\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

Therefore, they need to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each currently has from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. According to the bet, he gives up $10 for each orange he eats. Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."

"To determine the cost per razor after the discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**

"First, let's calculate the total height of the human pyramid.

1. There are 9 cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall, and 1 cheerleader who is 60 inches tall.
2. The pyramid structure is as follows:
   - Bottom layer: 4 cheerleaders
   - Second layer: 3 cheerleaders
   - Third layer: 2 cheerleaders
   - Top: 1 cheerleader (the shortest one)

The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders in each layer.

- Bottom layer: \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches
- Second layer: \(3 \times 64 = 192\) inches
- Third layer: \(2 \times 64 = 128\) inches
- Top: \(1 \times 60 = 60\) inches

Adding these together gives the total height of the pyramid in inches:
\[256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}\]

To convert the height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the cost for both the morning and afternoon rides and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning each day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives in the morning for 14 days.

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars/ride} \times 14 \text{ rides} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon each day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives in the afternoon for 14 days.

The total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars/ride} \times 14 \text{ rides} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we find the total number of oranges both Brianne and Ashley brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie. Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equally costly, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( x \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the number of guests, \( x \), for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."

1. Together they collected 43 insects: \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. Lily found 7 more than David: \( L = D + 7 \)
3. David found half of what Bodhi found: \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) or equivalently \( B = 2D \)

We can substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \( D = 9 \), we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

To verify, we check the total:
\[ L + D + B = 16 + 9 + 18 = 43 \]
The total is correct. Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, the amount of yarn Mariah used is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. The amount of yarn her grandma used is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

Therefore, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:
\[
\boxed{273}
\]"
"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

   \]

2. Calculate the number of gifts for the 3 friends who each want 2 gifts:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ gifts}
   \]

3. Add the gifts for all 5 friends:
   \[
   10 + 6 = 16 \text{ gifts}
   \]

4. Add the 10 additional random gifts:
   \[
   16 + 10 = 26 \text{ gifts}
   \]

So, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
\[
\boxed{26}

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Given that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, we can calculate the width of the rug as follows:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Using the width of the rug we just calculated:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost for all four packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented by the equation:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood. The 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks, while the 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks.

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood}
\]
If he buys 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood, he will get:
\[
6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces of 2 x 8 wood}
\]
If he buys 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he will get:
\[
4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Comparing the two options, buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood gives him more sticks (1600) than buying 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood (1200). Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is:
\[
\boxed{1600}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of legs among Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, we calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$4.40 \text{ per day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ \$4.40 \text{ per day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

The cost of the weekly bus pass is $20. To find out how much she would save by buying the weekly bus pass, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her trips without the pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to verify the number of cows in the zoo based on the information that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo would have:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to verify the number of sheep on the farm based on the information that the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm would have:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

So, the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by analyzing the information given:

- Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
- Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

First, we calculate the number of onions Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} \times 4 = 12 \]
Solving for the number of onions Sophia bought:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the number of potatoes Sophia bought. Similarly, since Rose bought 4 times the number of potatoes that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} \times 4 = 4 \]
Solving for the number of potatoes Sophia bought:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Now, we add the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought to find the total:
\[ \text{Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought} = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Thus, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs:**
   \[
   30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal:**
   - Today is December 31st, and his birthday is July 19th.
   - From December 31st to July 19th, we need to count the days.
   - December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days.
   - January has 31 days.
   - February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).
   - March has 31 days.
   - April has 30 days.
   - May has 31 days.
   - June has 30 days.
   - July up to July 19th is 19 days.
   - Adding these together:
     \[
     0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit required:**
   \[
   \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, his total earnings for the week would be:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she runs 8 laps, we can find the total distance by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Since she runs 2 km, we multiply the distance by the amount of water per kilometer:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink \(\boxed{120}\) milliliters of water."

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, after buying clothes, Julie had:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, after buying CDs, Julie had:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Julie had left is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, using the relationship \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000."

Therefore, the number of cookies Kelsie made is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount of money can be calculated as follows:

\[ 4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, Ali has $160 in total.

Next, Ali gives half of this amount to his sister. Therefore, the amount given to his sister is:

\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving $80 to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:

\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

1. **Current Daily Consumption:**
   - Ada consumes 12 kilowatts per hour daily.

2. **Current Weekly Consumption:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - There are 7 days in a week, so her weekly consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

3. **Current Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kWh is $1.50, so her weekly cost is:
     \[
     84 \text{ kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$126
     \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's new weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

4. **New Daily Consumption:**
   - The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour.
   - Adding this to her current daily consumption:
     \[

     \]

5. **New Weekly Consumption:**
   - Her new weekly consumption is:
     \[
     14 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

6. **New Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kWh is still $1.50, so her new weekly cost is:
     \[
     98 \text{ kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$147
     \]

Finally, let's find the difference between her new and old weekly electric bills.

7. **Difference in Weekly Cost:**
   - The difference is:

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then they can paint a whole house in 10 days. 

To find the daily painting rate of one person, we divide the total time by the number of houses they can paint in that time:
\[ \text{Daily rate of one person} = \frac{10 \text{ days}}{1 \text{ house}} = 10 \text{ days/house} \]

This means one person can paint 1/10 of a house per day.

Now, if we have 5 people working together, their combined daily painting rate is:
\[ 5 \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ house/day} = \frac{5}{10} \text{ house/day} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house/day} \]

This means 5 people can paint half a house per day. Therefore, to paint a whole house, it would take:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ house}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ house/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 48 \text{ hours} \]"

   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so if \( C_O \) is the number of chairs Ophelia has, then:
     \[
     C_O = 20 + 2 = 22
     \]

2. **Determine the number of chairs Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
   - If \( C_J \) is the number of chairs Jenna has, then:
     \[
     C_J = 3 \times 22 = 66
     \]

3. **Determine the number of sofas Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
   - If \( S_J \) is the number of sofas Jenna has, then:
     \[
     S_J = 66 - 2 = 64
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Total number of sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas
     \[
     \text{Total sofas} = 20 + 64 = 84
     \]
   - Total number of chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs

"First, let's determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Cost of CD} \]
\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. If he had not bought the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could have bought is:

\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{\text{Total amount available}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} \]
\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{48}{4} = 12 \]

Since Tom originally bought 1 CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

\[ \text{Additional CDs} = \text{Number of CDs he could have bought} - \text{Number of CDs he originally bought} \]
\[ \text{Additional CDs} = 12 - 1 = 11 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of passengers on the bus:**
   \[
   48
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - 5 times as many passengers as those who got off get on the bus.
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   - Calculate the number of passengers after the first stop:
   \[
   48 - 8 + 40 = 80
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   - 21 passengers get off the bus.
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than those who got off.

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[ 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 \]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find out how many years separate Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:
\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + \text{Cost of the printer} = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 1100 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 1800 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:

\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"To determine how many seashells each girl brought back, we start by identifying the number of seashells each boy brought back, which is given as 60 seashells.

Next, we need to calculate the number of seashells each girl brought back. According to the problem, each girl brought back an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Therefore, we can express the number of seashells each girl brought back as:

\[ 60 + 4 \times 60 \]

First, we calculate \(4 \times 60\):

\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \]

Then, we add this to the 60 seashells brought by the boys:

\[ 60 + 240 = 300 \]

So, each girl brought back 300 seashells. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is:
   \[
   50 \text{ mm} - 5 \text{ mm} = 45 \text{ mm}
   \]
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \text{ mm} = 62 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm} = 188 \text{ mm}
\]

The total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to break down the month into its halves and understand the relationship between the savings in the first and second halves.

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the next 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings for the first half of April would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. So, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). The total savings for the second half of April would be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's total savings for the month of April should be $1125. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total savings for the month:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, the daily savings in the first half of April is $25. Since the daily savings in the second half is twice that of the first half, we calculate:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit Verna bought:

1. **Apples:**
   - Number of apples: 3
   - Cost per apple: $1.50
   - Total cost for apples: \( 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50 \)

2. **Oranges:**
   - Number of oranges: 5
   - Cost per orange: $0.80
   - Total cost for oranges: \( 5 \times 0.80 = 4.00 \)

3. **Peaches:**
   - Number of peaches: 6
   - Cost per peach: $0.75
   - Total cost for peaches: \( 6 \times 0.75 = 4.50 \)

Next, we add up the total costs of all the fruits:

\[
4.50 \text{ (apples)} + 4.00 \text{ (oranges)} + 4.50 \text{ (peaches)} = 13.00
\]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:

\[
20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
\]

Therefore, the change Verna received is \(\boxed{7.00}\)."

\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money they are dividing is 100 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as follows:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned from her sales, we need to break down the commission calculation into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the commission for the amount over $1000.

1. **Commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission amount = $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

2. **Commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
   - Commission rate for the amount over $1000 is 10%.
   - Commission amount = $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

3. **Total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission for the first $1000 + Commission for the amount over $1000.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun:**
   The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Rate of Movement:**
   The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

3. **Total Movement in 10 Hours:**
   Over 10 hours, the sun will move:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **Final Angle of the Sun:**
   Adding the initial angle to the total movement:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Therefore, after 10 hours, the angle from the ground to the sun will be **82 degrees**."
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. Therefore, the age of the younger son is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs one candle per year, the total number of candles required is:

\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total amount James spends on candles is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total reading time in the first week.**
Judy read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week.
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of pages read in the first week.**
Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 105 minutes, we use the following calculation:
\[ \text{Pages per minute} = \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]
\[ \text{Pages read in the first week} = 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of pages read in the second week.**
We are given that Judy read a total of 100 pages in the second week.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of pages read in two weeks.**
\[ \text{Total pages read} = \text{Pages read in the first week} + \text{Pages read in the second week} \]
\[ \text{Total pages read} = 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many sandwiches Cody ate. Since Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

Next, let's calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Since Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

So, Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

Now, we add the number of sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate to find the total number of sandwiches consumed:

\[
4 + 3 = 7
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches consumed from the original number of sandwiches to find out how many are left:

\[
12 - 7 = 5
\]

So, the number of sandwiches left is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
- Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old.
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, in 7 years, his nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old, and we can write the equation:
  \[
  51 = 3(N + 7)
  \]

Now, we solve for \( N \):
\[
51 = 3(N + 7)
\]
\[
51 = 3N + 21
\]
Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[
30 = 3N
\]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[
N = 10
\]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently \(\boxed{10}\) years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 per tooth.
   - Therefore, for three teeth, the total amount is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as she had given for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Since the previous amount was $1.00, half of that is \( \frac{1}{2} = 0.50 \) dollars per tooth.
   - Therefore, for two teeth, the total amount is \(2 \times 0.50 = 1\) dollar.

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount = \(5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00\) dollars.

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of \(\boxed{9.00}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given about Richie's goals.

1. **Richie's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 80 goals.

2. **Goals Scored by Mark:**
   - Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
   - Therefore, Mark scored \(80 - 20 = 60\) goals.

3. **Goals Scored by Anna:**
   - Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
   - Therefore, Anna scored \(80 - 45 = 35\) goals.

4. **Total Goals Scored by All Three:**
   - Add the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna.
   - Total goals = \(80 + 60 + 35 = 175\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{175}

"First, let's calculate how much money Mitchell made from selling lemonade. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, the total amount of money Mitchell made is:

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times \$4 \text{ per lemonade} = \$84 \]

Next, we know that Liam made $63 that weekend. To find out how much more money Mitchell made compared to Liam, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made:

\[ \$84 - \$63 = \$21 \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we calculate his daily spending as follows:

\[
\text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
\]

Next, we calculate how much money Peter spends from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends $10 each day for 4 days, the total amount spent from Sunday through Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Total spent from Sunday to Wednesday} = 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we determine how much money Peter has left after Wednesday. Since he started with $70 and spent $40 from Sunday to Wednesday, the remaining amount is:

\[
\text{Remaining money} = 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

For the rest of the week (Thursday and Friday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $30 is:

\[
\text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter buys wooden action figures which cost $5 each. The number of wooden action figures he can buy with $40 is:

\[
\text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{40}{5} = 8
\]

Adding the number of wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[
\text{Total action figures} = 8 + 15 = 23
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten so far, we need to add up the costs of spaying, the vaccines, and the broken vases.

1. **Spaying cost**: $200
2. **Cost of 3 vaccines**: $20 each, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\)
3. **Cost of 4 broken vases**: $12 each, so \(4 \times 12 = 48\)

Now, we add these amounts together:

\[
200 + 60 + 48 = 308
\]

So, the total cost so far is \(\boxed{308}\)."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
3. Calculate the difference between the number of roses Ford grows in a month and the number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

First, let's find out how many roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses supplied per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we need to find out how many roses Ford grows in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total number of roses Ford grows in a month is:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of roses Ford needs to supply to the flower shops in a month:
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 260 \text{ roses} \]

Finally, we find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month:
\[ 260 \text{ roses} - 160 \text{ roses} = 100 \text{ roses} \]

So, Ford lacks \(\boxed{100}\) roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To determine how much money Katina will have in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money removed from the account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total from the initial amount in the account.

First, we calculate the total amount of money removed from the account over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over 2 years there are:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months} \]

Katina removes $100 each month, so over 24 months, she will remove:
\[ 24 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:
\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money remaining in the account after 2 years is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00.

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf of bread costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00.
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00.

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The net profit is $37.00."

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw and then divide that by the number of days.

1. Calculate the total number of birds seen:
   - Days one and two: 50 birds
   - Day three: 0 birds
   - Days four and five: 120 birds
   - Day six: 20 birds
   - Day seven: 90 birds

   Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

2. Divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7 days) to find the average:

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. Let's denote this starting value as \( x \). So, \( x = 20 \).

2. **First Operation**: The problem states that this starting value plus half of the number (which is the same as the starting value in this context) is divided by 5. This can be written as:
   \[
   \frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5}
   \]
   Substituting \( x = 20 \):
   \[
   \frac{20 + \frac{20}{2}}{5} = \frac{20 + 10}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

3. **Second Operation**: The resulting value from the first operation (which is 6) is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12. This can be written as:
   \[
   6 \times (x - 12)
   \]
   Substituting \( x = 20 \):
   \[
   6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48

"To determine the correct temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. The actual temperature is 468 when Maggie sets it to 450. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature, when increased by 4%, equals 520 degrees. Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Then:

\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees."
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then sum them up.

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
   - 2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes
   - Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes

3. Adding the durations of both movies:
   - 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to determine how much less it is compared to Herb's house. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we calculate 30% of $76,000 and subtract that from $76,000.

First, calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

Now, subtract this amount from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200. Now, we add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house to find the combined value:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. Since a dozen is 12, Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Therefore, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought: \(12 \text{ (Judy's cups)} + 40 \text{ (friend's cups)} = 52\)
- Total dishes brought: \(24 \text{ (Judy's dishes)} + 44 \text{ (friend's dishes)} = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

\[52 \text{ (cups)} + 68 \text{ (dishes)} = 120\]

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact when buying 2 boxes, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts when buying 2 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

- Saturday: Twice as long as Jill, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours
- Sunday: Three times as long as Jill, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
- Total hours for John: \(4 + 3 = 7\) hours

Next, we calculate the total earnings for both John and Jill.

**Earnings Calculation:**
- Pay rate: $10 per hour

**Jill's Earnings:**
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$30 \]

**John's Earnings:**
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$70 \]

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

**Difference in Earnings:**
\[ \$70 - \$30 = \$40 \]

So, John earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, according to the given ratio, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. We can calculate the total amount of water she needs as follows:

Total water needed = (Total calories burned / 200 calories) * 100 ml

Total water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express the number of red and green jelly beans in terms of \( B \):

- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

Therefore, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the boots and shipping on Amazon.com:
- Cost of boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4
- Total cost on Amazon: $16 + $4 = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the boots and shipping on eBay:
- Cost of boots: $13
- Shipping cost: Twice the cost of Amazon's shipping, so $4 * 2 = $8
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we need to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon:
- Total cost on eBay: $21
- Total cost on Amazon: $20
- Difference: $21 - $20 = $1

The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial height**: The beanstalk starts at 4 feet.
2. **Day 1**: The height doubles to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet.
3. **Day 2**: The height doubles to \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet.
4. **Day 3**: The height doubles to \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet.

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet required to be taller than the window.

Thus, it takes \(\boxed{3}\) days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window."
"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the protein content per 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - We know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain \(2 \times 3 = 6\) grams of protein (since 200 grams is twice 100 grams).

2. **Calculate the protein content per week:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, the total protein intake per week is \(6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week}\).

Thus, John gets **42 grams of protein per week**."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( J \) from both sides:
\[ 0 = J - 10 \]
Add 10 to both sides:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be \(\boxed{13}\) years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. **Cost of 2 implants:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - Total cost for 2 implants: \( 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the porcelain crown:**
   - The porcelain crown for one implant costs an extra $500.
   - Total cost for the porcelain crown: \( 500 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost of dental work:**

4. **Amount already paid:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - Remaining amount to be paid: \( 4500 - 600 = 3900 \) dollars.

5. **Hourly wage and required hours:**
   - George makes $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: \( \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \) hours.

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Thus, the measure of the largest angle is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has in each type of coin:

"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

we substitute the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional \(\boxed{5}\) hours to travel 2000 miles."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \text{Pounds Ruiz makes per hour} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in one hour:

\[ \text{Pounds Marissa makes per hour} = 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ \text{Pounds together per hour} = 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we calculate the total amount of chocolates they made together in 12 hours:

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to calculate his earnings for each period separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the first four hours are \(15 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$7.50/\text{hour}\).
- Over four hours, his total earnings are \(4 \text{ hours} \times \$7.50/\text{hour} = \$30.00\).

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the next two hours are \(10 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$6.00/\text{hour}\).
- Over two hours, his total earnings are \(2 \text{ hours} \times \$6.00/\text{hour} = \$12.00\).

Finally, we sum the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00.

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy.
2. Multiply the total number of hours by the cost per hour.

First, let's find the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy. He went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he went twice for 2 hours each time.

- Number of weeks: 6
- Sessions per week: 2
- Hours per session: 2

Total hours per week = 2 sessions/week * 2 hours/session = 4 hours/week

Total hours for 6 weeks = 6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

Next, we calculate the total cost. The cost per hour is $125.

Total cost = Total hours * Cost per hour = 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000

So, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day.

1. **Initial Pack of Gum:**
   Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewed at School:**
   Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours per piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, Jim chews 4 pieces of gum during the school day.

3. **Gum Chewed on the Way Home and After Dinner:**
   Jim chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, Jim chews 2 more pieces of gum after school.

4. **Total Pieces Chewed:**
   Adding the pieces chewed at school and after school:
   \[
   4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Remaining Pieces Before Giving to Sister:**
   Subtract the total pieces chewed from the initial pack:
   \[
   20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

6. **Gum Given to Sister:**
   Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

7. **Final Pieces of Gum:**
   Subtract the pieces given to his sister from the remaining pieces:
   \[
   14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

So, at the end of the day, Jim has \(\boxed{7}\) pieces of gum left."

"To calculate Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

**Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s**

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

**Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in that week, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Cars towed in the first three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
     \[
     6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Total number of cars towed in the week:**
   - Adding the cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days:
     \[
     30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
     \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[

"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet to compare it with the height requirement for the roller coaster. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The height requirement for the roller coaster is 4 feet. To find out how much more Adam needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:

\[ \text{Height needed to grow} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the height he needs to grow into inches:

\[ \text{Height needed to grow in inches} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches, given that he grows 2 inches per year:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time required to dig through the soil and the time required to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time required to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
- The time to dig through the soil is given by the formula: time = distance / rate.
- So, the time to dig through the soil is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

Next, let's calculate the time required to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the speed through clay, which is \( \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \).
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
- The time to dig through the clay is \( \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \).

Now, we sum the times for the soil and the clay:
- Total time = time to dig through soil + time to dig through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is \(\boxed{10}\) hours."

1. **Initial Likes**: Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo after 1 week.

2. **Likes After 3 Weeks**: Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes.
   \[
   \text{Likes after 3 weeks} = 70 \times 2000 = 140000
   \]

3. **Additional Likes Recently**: She received 20000 more new likes recently.
   \[
   \text{Total likes} = \text{Likes after 3 weeks} + \text{Additional likes} = 140000 + 20000 = 160000
   \]

So, the total number of Instagram likes is:
\[
\boxed{160000}

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is \(\boxed{142}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the earnings from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total earnings for the first month:**
   - Total earnings in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total earnings in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the earnings for the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Therefore, the total earnings in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total earnings for both months:**
   - Total earnings for two months = Earnings in the first month + Earnings in the second month
   - Total earnings for two months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

**Final Answer:**
2100"
"First, let's determine the total duration James hires the horse-drawn carriage. He hires it from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

Next, we account for the free hour. Since he gets 1 hour free, the effective paid time is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} - 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first hour costs $15.
- Each subsequent hour costs twice the first hour, which is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 3 paid hours:
- The first hour costs $15.
- The next two hours each cost $30.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 15 + 30 + 30 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally received this week.
2. Subtract the amount she should have received (her weekly wage) from the total amount received to find out how much was withheld.

First, we know that Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420. Therefore, the total amount of money she received this week is:
\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \]

Next, we know that her weekly wage should be $300. Since she only received $220, the amount withheld from her wage is:
\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

So, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

   \text{Initial Cost} = \$150,000
   \]

2. **Monthly Hanger Rental Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Hanger Cost} = \$5,000
   \]

3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Fuel Cost} = 2 \times \text{Monthly Hanger Cost} = 2 \times \$5,000 = \$10,000
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Maintenance Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total Monthly Maintenance Cost} = \text{Monthly Hanger Cost} + \text{Monthly Fuel Cost} = \$5,000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000
   \]

5. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost for the First Year} = \text{Initial Cost} + (\text{Total Monthly Maintenance Cost} \times 12)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cooking time for rice:**
   - It is given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.
   - So, the cooking time for rice (\(R\)) is 30 minutes.
   \[
   R = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Determine the cooking time for pork:**
   - It is given that it took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork (\(P\)) is:
   \[
   P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Determine the cooking time for beans:**
   - The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - The combined cooking time of pork and rice is:
   \[
   P + R = 50 + 30 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans (\(B\)) is:
   \[
   B = \frac{P + R}{2} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cooking time:**
   - The total cooking time is the sum of the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

Thus, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs \(\boxed{3}\) dollars more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.
3. The total number of animal heads is 20.
4. The total number of animal legs is 70.

We can write the following equations based on the information:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

To verify, we can substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Now, let's check the number of legs:
- Sheep: \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs
- Geese: \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) legs
- Total legs: \( 60 + 10 = 70 \)

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"First, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach this height, we subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow an additional 360 inches, we divide the required growth by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the total number of toys James needs.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - When he returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so the number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for 24 dogs.

3. **After Buying More Toys:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - When he returns again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he still has enough toys for 21 dogs.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - Initially, he needed 12 toys.
   - Then he needed 12 more toys.
   - He does not need to buy any more toys after the third visit because he has enough for the current number of dogs.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

"To solve this problem, we first determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can find out how many hash browns one potato makes by dividing 36 by 6:

\[ \frac{36}{6} = 6 \]

This means that 1 potato makes 6 hash browns. Now, to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we multiply the number of hash browns one potato makes by 96:

\[ 6 \times 96 = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, calculate the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack.

Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg, so the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Including Jack, the total number of people is 9, so the total weight is:
\[ 640 + 80 = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 - 700 = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Let's break down the information given step by step:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. Therefore, Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. Therefore, the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. Therefore, Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, we need to find the total number of cookies they have together:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Adding these together:
\[68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\]

So, the total number of cookies they have is \(\boxed{298}\)."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}
  \]
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ lawns per minute}
  \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}}{\frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}}{\frac{1}{40} \text{ lawns per minute}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times for both modes to find the total time:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they have already spent walking from the total time they have available.

1. Total time available: 30 minutes
2. Time taken to the corner (library): 6 minutes
3. Time taken from the corner to the fire station: 13 minutes

First, we add the time spent at the library and the fire station:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we subtract the time already spent from the total time available:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John and Jack have \(\boxed{11}\) minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To determine the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit separately and then sum these costs.

1. **Apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples.
   - The cost per kilo of apples is $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     1 \text{ kilo} \times \$4/\text{kilo} = \$4
     \]

2. **Bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas.
   - The cost per kilo of bananas is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost for bananas is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times \$2/\text{kilo} = \$4
     \]

3. **Oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges.
   - The cost per kilo of oranges is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost for oranges is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times \$3/\text{kilo} = \$6
     \]

Now, we sum the costs of all the fruits:
\[
\$4 \text{ (apples)} + \$4 \text{ (bananas)} + \$6 \text{ (oranges)} = \$14
\]

Thus, the total amount Catherine pays is:
\[
\boxed{14}

"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

After baking, the pair eats 10 cookies. So, we subtract the 10 cookies they ate from the total number of cookies:

\[ \text{Cookies left} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Therefore, the age of the older triplet would be \( x + 7 \) because one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of each twin is the same. Let's denote the age of each twin as \( y \).

The combined ages of the four individuals (one twin, one triplet, and the other two triplets) are given as 44. So, we can write the equation as:
\[ y + (x + 7) + x + x = 44 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ y + 3x + 7 = 44 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ y + 3x = 37 \]

We need to find the value of \( y \). To do this, we need to express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = 37 - 3x \]

Since \( y \) and \( x \) are ages, they must be positive integers. We need to find a value of \( x \) that makes \( y \) a positive integer. Let's test some values for \( x \):

If \( x = 10 \):
\[ y = 37 - 3(10) = 37 - 30 = 7 \]

So, if the younger triplet is 10 years old, the older triplet is \( 10 + 7 = 17 \) years old, and each twin is 7 years old. Let's check the combined ages:
\[ 7 + 17 + 10 + 10 = 44 \]

The combined ages match the given information. Therefore, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends on his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap:

180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap.

**100 minutes**"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies. We know that four candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:

\[ \text{Cost of one candy} = \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 candies:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 candies} = 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

We also know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8.00 + 4.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong. Since Rong saves 20 coins each month, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person has saved after 10 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over 10 years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong saves 20 coins each month, so over 120 months, he saves:

\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves 28 coins each month, so over 120 months, he saves:

\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding the coins saved by both Rong and Neil gives us the total number of coins they have together after 10 years:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.6x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of a banana. We know that one apple costs $0.50 and a banana costs twice as much as an apple. Therefore, the cost of one banana is:
\[ 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of an orange. An orange costs three times as much as a banana. Therefore, the cost of one orange is:
\[ 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the bananas in the crate. There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost of the bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1.00 = 5.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the apples in the crate. There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost of the apples is:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the oranges in the crate. There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost of the oranges is:
\[ 7 \times 3.00 = 21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the bananas, apples, and oranges to find the total cost of the crate:
\[ 5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \boxed{32.00} \]"

1. **Red Squares:**
   - Given: 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 (red squares) + 4 = 18.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 (blue squares) + 6 = 24.

4. **White Squares:**
   - There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 (green squares) - 12 = 12.

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68

"To find the number of 8 point bucks, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of bucks in the field.
2. Calculate 20 percent of the bucks to find the number of 8 point bucks.

First, we know that 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks. So, we calculate the number of bucks as follows:
\[ \text{Number of bucks} = 50 \times \frac{50}{100} = 50 \times 0.5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 point bucks. We know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 point bucks. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of 8 point bucks} = 25 \times \frac{20}{100} = 25 \times 0.2 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of 8 point bucks is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam's Points**: Adam has 50 points.
2. **Betty's Points**: Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Tom's Points**: Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]
4. **Betty's Points (Recheck)**: We already calculated Betty's points as 65, so this is consistent.
5. **Marta's Points**: Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all students:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

"To determine how many additional hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to calculate how much more money they need to raise. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. Therefore, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. From the information given, in the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. So, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200. Since they raise $700 per hour, the number of additional hours required is:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Therefore, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

So, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for each type of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream:
  \[
  50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
  \]
- For vanilla ice cream:
  \[
  12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Finally, we sum the total production of both types of ice cream:
\[
2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is:
\[
\boxed{3000}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

1. **Croissants**: 
   - 5 croissants at $3.00 each
   - Total cost for croissants = \( 5 \times 3.00 = 15.00 \)

2. **Cinnamon rolls**: 
   - 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each
   - Total cost for cinnamon rolls = \( 4 \times 2.50 = 10.00 \)

3. **Mini quiches**: 
   - 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each
   - Total cost for mini quiches = \( 3 \times 4.00 = 12.00 \)

4. **Blueberry muffins**: 
   - 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each
   - Total cost for blueberry muffins = \( 13 \times 1.00 = 13.00 \)

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 15.00 + 10.00 + 12.00 + 13.00 = 50.00 \]

Now, Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his total purchase. We need to calculate 10% of $50.00:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 50.00 = 0.10 \times 50.00 = 5.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 50.00 - 5.00 = 45.00 \]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:
\[ \boxed{45.00} \]"
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

**Final Answer:**
6"
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy each eat in two weeks.

Two weeks consist of 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Initially, both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, the amount of candy each has left is:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Ginger} \]
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Amy} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger."
"First, we need to determine the area that Mr. Boarden wants to cover. He wants to cover two thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom. We calculate this as follows:

\[
\text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ square feet}
\]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 square feet, the number of tiles required is:

\[
\text{Number of tiles} = 24 \times 24 = 576
\]

So, Mr. Boarden would need \(\boxed{576}\) mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom."
"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Calculate the total cost of picking blueberries:**
   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound × Pounds picked)
   \[
   \text{Total cost of picking} = 20 + (1.5 \times 30) = 20 + 45 = 65
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of buying blueberries at the store:**

"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps per minute for each foot:
- When her arms are down, her right foot taps at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute.
- When her arms are raised, her right foot taps at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute.

Next, we need to determine the total time for each condition:
- Helga dances with her arms down for \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes.
- Helga dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes.

Now, we calculate the total taps for each condition:
1. **With arms down:**
   - Right foot: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
   - Left foot: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)

2. **With arms raised:**
   - Right foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
   - Left foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)

Finally, we sum the taps from both conditions:
- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150\)

The combined total number of taps is:
\[1300 + 1150 = 2450\]

Thus, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{2450}\)."

"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 5 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and his two friends ate. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]

Since three people ate 8 slices each, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate how many slices the other two friends ate. Each of these two people ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Since two people ate 9 slices each, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Thus, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The dog can eat the sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog takes:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"First, let's convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches, we get:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."

- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these cars is:
\[
16 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these cars is:
\[
24 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars:

"First, let's calculate Dora's father's age. Given that Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can express this as:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]

Substituting Dora's age (15) into the equation:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age. Since Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"First, let's determine how many votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we calculate Beck's apples as follows:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Steven has, then use that information to find out how many books Alice has, and finally, calculate the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice.

1. **Determine the number of books Steven has:**
   Clara has two times as many books as Steven. Since Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2 \times \text{(number of books Steven has)} = 20
   \]
   Solving for the number of books Steven has:
   \[
   \text{Number of books Steven has} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

2. **Determine the number of books Alice has:**
   Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Since Steven has 10 books, we can calculate the number of books Alice has as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of books Alice has} = 10 + 6 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate how many more books Clara has than Alice:**
   Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books. The difference is:
   \[
   20 - 16 = 4
   \]

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"

   \]

4. **Calculate the number of students who like to play either video games or music:**
   \[
   \text{Students who like to play either video games or music} = \text{Total students} - \text{Students who like to bake} - \text{Students who like to play basketball}
   \]
   \[
   = 50 - 10 - 5 = 35
   \]

5. **Let \( x \) be the number of students who like to play music. According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball:**
   \[
   x = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

6. **Determine the number of students who like to play video games:**
   \[
   \text{Students who like to play video games} = \text{Students who like to play either video games or music} - \text{Students who like to play music}
   \]
   \[
   = 35 - 10 = 25
   \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is \(\boxed{25}\)."

"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students in each class:**
   Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of girls in each class:**
   We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, we calculate 40% of 40:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of boys in each class:**
   Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the number of boys is:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
   \]

Thus, the number of boys in each class is \(\boxed{24}\)."

"First, let's determine how many students will be in each of the six groups when fifty-four students are divided equally among them:

\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for each of the 12 groups if the activity requires 12 groups:

\[ \text{Number of students per group for 12 groups} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, and we have 54 students, we need to determine how many groups of whole students we can form with 54 students. We already know that 54 students can be divided into 6 groups of 9 students each. To form 12 groups, we need:

\[ \text{Total number of students needed for 12 groups} = 12 \times 4.5 = 54 \]

Since we only have 54 students and we already have 6 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to make a total of 12 groups:

\[ \text{Number of additional groups needed} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single week:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

So, the number of chairs rented during weekdays in one week is:
\[ 60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ chairs} \]

And the number of chairs rented during weekends in one week is:
\[ 100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ chairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of chairs rented in one week is:
\[ 300 \text{ chairs} + 200 \text{ chairs} = 500 \text{ chairs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are rented in two 4-week months. Since each 4-week month consists of 4 weeks, two 4-week months consist of:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is:
\[ 500 \text{ chairs/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 4000 \text{ chairs} \]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bananas Gunther has in the end.

1. **Initial number of bananas:**
   Gunther starts with 48 bananas.

2. **Arnold steals half of the bananas:**
   Arnold steals half of the 48 bananas.
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, Gunther is left with:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. **Gunther adds 25 more bananas:**
   Gunther adds 25 bananas to his pile.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - The remaining small stickers = \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - The remaining large stickers = \(40 - 20 = 20\) large stickers.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.
   - Adding the small buttons from the large stickers to the small buttons from the small stickers, Lorraine has \(60 + 3 = 63\) small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 27 small buttons from the small stickers and 20 large buttons from the large stickers.
   - Total buttons = \(27 + 20 = 47\).

Thus, the final number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \(\boxed{47}\)."

3. On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we sum the matches from each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, and this total is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into this expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order.

   - \( \text{XS} = 11 \)

2. **Small (S) Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - \( \text{S} = 2 \times \text{XS} = 2 \times 11 = 22 \)

3. **Medium (M) Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - \( \text{M} = \text{S} - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18 \)

4. **Large (L) Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - \( \text{L} = \frac{\text{M}}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)

5. **Extra-Large (XL) Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - \( \text{XL} = \text{L} + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15 \)

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed:
\[
\text{Total Shirts} = \text{XS} + \text{S} + \text{M} + \text{L} + \text{XL} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15
\]

Calculating the total:
\[
11 + 22 = 33
\]
\[
33 + 18 = 51
\]
\[
51 + 9 = 60
\]
\[
60 + 15 = 75

"To determine the total number of puppies Jana has, we can follow these steps:

1. Let the total number of Pomeranians be \( P \).
2. According to the problem, one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}P = 6
   \]
3. Solving for \( P \):
   \[
   P = 6 \times 3 = 18
   \]
   So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

4. The problem states that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let the total number of puppies be \( T \). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}T = 18

"First, let's determine how much money Ava gave to Jayden. Ava has $90 and she gave Jayden half of it:

\[ \text{Amount given by Ava} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Next, we add the amount Jayden originally had to the amount given by Ava:

\[ \text{Total amount Jayden has} = 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200, so we need to find out how much more Jayden needs by subtracting the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:

\[ \text{Amount needed} = 200 - 115 = 85 \]

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases of shingles for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Since the problem asks for the final numerical answer, we can round to the nearest whole number if necessary, but the exact answer is:

\[ \frac{1000}{7} \]

So, the third house will need \(\boxed{\frac{1000}{7}}\) cases of shingles."

"Let's define the variables for the number of enemies, berries, and time for both Ava and Emma.

- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of berries Ava collects.
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \)

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the values of \( A_e \), \( A_b \), and \( A_t \) in terms of \( E_e \), \( E_b \), and \( E_t \):
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \) on one side, we get:

\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]

\[ -3W = -12 \]

Divide both sides by -3:

\[ W = 4 \]

Now substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):

\[ O = 17 - 4 \]

\[ O = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

To find the special hourly rate:

\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate the pay for the 3 additional hours:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, we add the regular pay and the additional pay to find the total amount Jamie was paid for her work on Tuesday:

\[ \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on Tuesday."

3. Identify the number of lion cubs, which is given as 14.

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together to find the total number of lions in the enclosure:
\[ 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 \]

Thus, the total number of lions in the enclosure is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised at 25% off.

To find the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount} = 40 \times \frac{25}{100} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ \text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price from the amount he paid:
\[ \text{Change} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Mike will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.
2. Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
3. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
4. Determine the total amount paid over three months.

**Step 1: Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

"First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at different points in time:

1. **Billy's starting hourly wage:** $10.00 per hour.
2. **After 2 months, Billy's raise:** $0.50 per hour, so his new wage is $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary, Billy's raise:** $1.00 per hour, so his new wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours of work at his final wage:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50 \text{ per hour} = \$230.00 \]

Next, we determine Sally's starting hourly wage:
\[ \text{Sally's starting wage} = \$10.00 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour} \]

Now, let's calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours of work at her starting wage:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = \$210.00 \]

Finally, we find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally:

"First, let's determine how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. Pierson scored 278 points.

To find half of Pierson's points:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Next, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's points:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

So, Nikita scored 150 points.

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their individual scores together:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[ 428 \]"
"To determine the total number of trees planted at the end of the reforestation campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers, then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- Each class has 25 students.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \( 25 \times 40 = 1000 \).
- Each student plants 1 tree.
- So, the total number of trees planted by the students is \( 1000 \times 1 = 1000 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \( 3 \times 40 = 120 \).
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.
- So, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is \( 120 \times 2 = 240 \).

Finally, we sum the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers:

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks (14 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the first 2 weeks} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours she plays in the second part of her schedule. She plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week (7 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the next week} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we add the hours from both parts of her schedule to find the total hours she has played so far.

\[ \text{Total hours played} = 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours.

\[ \text{Hours still needed} = 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Determine the separation between the two cars:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
   - Separation = Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car
   \[
   \text{Separation} = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, after 2 hours, the two cars will be separated by \(\boxed{20}\) miles."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the materials before the premium is added. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300, so the total cost of the materials is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on this total cost. A 30% premium means James pays an additional 30% of $900. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add this premium to the original cost of the materials to find the total amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final amount James paid is:

\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

1. **Third Graders:**
   - Number of third-graders: 500
   - Number of third-graders who passed: 340

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - Number of fourth-graders: 100
   - Number of fourth-graders who passed: 40

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - Number of fifth-graders: 400
   - Pass rate for fifth graders: Twice the fourth graders' pass rate
   - Fourth graders' pass rate: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \) or 40%
   - Fifth graders' pass rate: \( 2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \) or 80%
   - Number of fifth-graders who passed: \( 400 \times 0.8 = 320 \)

Next, we sum the number of students who passed across all grades:
\[ 340 \text{ (third graders)} + 40 \text{ (fourth graders)} + 320 \text{ (fifth graders)} = 680 \]

Now, we sum the total number of students who took the test:
\[ 500 \text{ (third graders)} + 100 \text{ (fourth graders)} + 400 \text{ (fifth graders)} = 1000 \]

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:
\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68 \]

Expressing this as a percentage:
\[ 0.68 \times 100 = 68\% \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is \( 68\% \).

**Final Answer:**
\[ 68\% \]"

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Dale initially planned to sell 100 butterscotch candies but ended up selling 150. After selling these, he ordered an additional 100 candies.

First, let's determine how many candies Dale has in total after his second order:
\[ 150 \text{ (sold)} + 100 \text{ (ordered)} = 250 \text{ candies} \]

Since Dale initially only had 100 candies and then sold 150, he actually had to order more to meet the demand. Now, he has 250 candies in total.

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to see how many he has left after selling the initial 150:
\[ 250 \text{ (total candies)} - 150 \text{ (sold)} = 100 \text{ candies} \]

So, Dale still needs to sell:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then determine the additional number of students by the end of May.

1. **Beginning of the year (January 1st):** 10 students
2. **End of January:** The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
3. **End of February:** The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
4. **End of March:** The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
5. **End of April:** The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
6. **End of May:** The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we need to find out how many additional students have joined by the end of May, compared to the beginning of the year.

- Number of students at the beginning of the year: 10
- Number of students at the end of May: 320

The additional number of students is:

So, the additional number of students that have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is **310**."
"To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Thus, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil in ounces.
- According to the problem, the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so \( o = 2s \).
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express all the quantities in terms of \( z \):
- \( s = 2z \)
- \( o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \)

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ o + s + z + z + s = 10 \]
Substituting the expressions for \( o \) and \( s \) in terms of \( z \):
\[ 4z + 2z + z + z + 2z = 10 \]
Combining like terms:
\[ 10z = 10 \]
Solving for \( z \):
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{4}\) ounces."
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \( 3 \times 500 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \( 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \( 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \) dollars.

\[ 8 \text{ (chocolate)} + 40 \text{ (toffee)} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:
\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

So, Paul should buy \(\boxed{15}\) more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. Initially, Joe had 40 cars. After selling 8 cars and giving away 16 cars, the number of cars he remains with is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

"To determine how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tins of cat food.
2. Calculate the total number of tins of dog food.
3. Find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and the total number of tins of dog food.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package of cat food contains 11 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is \(8 \times 11 = 88\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package of dog food contains 6 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Now, we find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and the total number of tins of dog food:
- The difference is \(88 - 36 = 52\).

So, Kimberly bought \(\boxed{52}\) more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each person has, which is given as 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we isolate \( P \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Then, we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Thus, the number of cards Becca has is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many eggs Cindy had in total.

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy had 5 green eggs.
   \[
   \text{Green eggs} = 5
   \]

2. **Blue Eggs**: Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green ones.
   \[
   \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times \text{Green eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Pink Eggs**: Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs.
   \[
   \text{Pink eggs} = \text{Blue eggs} - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9
   \]

4. **Yellow Eggs**: Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs.
   \[
   \text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Pink eggs} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
\[
\text{Total eggs} = \text{Green eggs} + \text{Blue eggs} + \text{Pink eggs} + \text{Yellow eggs} = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27
\]

So, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the same highway, given their speed relative to that of the kangaroos.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can denote the distance of the highway as \( D \) and the speed of each kangaroo as \( v \). The total speed of the 3 kangaroos combined is \( 3v \). Since they travel the distance \( D \) in 18 hours, we can write the equation for the distance as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 \]
\[ D = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for four turtles to travel the same distance \( D \). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). The total speed of the four turtles combined is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

We need to find the time \( t \) it takes for the four turtles to travel the distance \( D \). Using the formula \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \), we get:
\[ D = 2v \times t \]
Since we know \( D = 54v \), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[ 54v = 2v \times t \]
We can cancel \( v \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( v \neq 0 \)):
\[ 54 = 2t \]
Solving for \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, it will take the four turtles \(\boxed{27}\) hours to travel across the highway."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of clay dishes each person makes based on the information given.

1. Let \( K \) represent the number of clay dishes Kora makes. According to the problem, \( K = 20 \).

2. Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora. Therefore, the number of clay dishes Rory makes, \( R \), can be expressed as:
   \[
   R = K + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]

3. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory. Therefore, the number of clay dishes Jada makes, \( J \), can be expressed as:
   \[
   J = 2 \times R = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

Now, we need to find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together. We sum the number of dishes each person made:
\[
J + R + K = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140
\]

Thus, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is:
\[
\boxed{140}

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the reduced price of the laptop after trading in her old laptop.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her part-time job, and the money from her mom.
3. Use the information that she still needs $50 to find out how much she already has.

First, the reduced price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). According to the problem, the total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her part-time job, and the money from her mom, is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

We know that after adding this total to the $50 she still needs, she will have enough to buy the laptop. Therefore, the total amount of money she has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \text{ dollars} \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"

"First, calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces daily with 3 cows:

\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the extra 10 liters is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math (including those who are good at both math and English), we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of students who are good at math is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group requires and then see how many such groups can fit into the 2-hour concert duration, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group needs:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Available time for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Finally, we divide the available time by the time each group needs to find out how many groups can perform:
- Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11."
"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years with a simple interest scheme, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the principal amount (P), the interest rate (r), and the time period (t).
2. Use the simple interest formula: \( I = P \times r \times t \), where \( I \) is the interest earned.
3. Add the interest to the principal to find the total amount after the given time period.

Given:
- Principal amount (P) = $300
- Annual interest rate (r) = three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \) or 2.25 in decimal form.
- Time period (t) = 3 years

First, calculate the interest earned over 3 years:
\[ I = P \times r \times t = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

Calculate the product step by step:
\[ I = 300 \times 2.25 = 675 \]
\[ I = 675 \times 3 = 2025 \]

So, the interest earned over 3 years is $2025.

Next, add the interest to the principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total amount} = P + I = 300 + 2025 = 2325 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{2325} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of white shirts with collars:**
   - The store has 40 white shirts.
   - Half of the white shirts have collars.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

2. **Determine the number of white shirts without collars:**
   - Since there are 40 white shirts in total and 20 have collars, the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

3. **Determine the number of floral shirts with buttons:**
   - The store has 50 floral shirts.
   - 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

4. **Determine the number of floral shirts without buttons:**
   - Since there are 50 floral shirts in total and 20 have buttons, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

5. **Calculate the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and white shirts without collars:**
   - The number of floral shirts without buttons is 30.
   - The number of white shirts without collars is 20.
   - The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars."
"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer will use to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

So, the farmer will earn \(\$75\)."
"First, let's determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs of shoes to find the average cost per pair.

First, we know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs of shoes:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, the average cost per pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 3 baskets of green food is:
     \[
     3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food.
   - Therefore, the cost per basket of red food after the discount is:
     \[
     18 - 2 = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The total cost for 3 baskets of red food is:
     \[
     3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Add the total cost of the green food and the red food:

"To determine how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms that constitute one-half of the motel:
   \[
   \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
   \]

2. Determine the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room:
   \[
   45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour:
   \[
   \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Year:**
   - The town will build 12 homes.

2. **Second Year:**
   - They will build three times the number of homes built in the first year.
   - Number of homes in the second year = \(3 \times 12 = 36\).

3. **Third Year:**
   - They will build double the total number of homes built in the first two years.
   - Total homes built in the first two years = \(12 + 36 = 48\).
   - Number of homes in the third year = \(2 \times 48 = 96\).

4. **Total Homes Built Over Three Years:**
   - Sum of homes built in each year = \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\).

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals mentioned in the problem:

- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the person (you).
- Let \( P \) be the age of the mother.

From the problem, we can establish the following relationships:

1. You are three years younger than your brother:
   \[
   M = B - 3
   \]

2. You are two years older than your sister:
   \[
   S = M - 2
   \]

3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age:
   \[
   P = 3B - 1
   \]

4. The sum of all their ages is 87:
   \[
   M + S + B + P = 87
   \]

Now, substitute the expressions for \( M \), \( S \), and \( P \) into the sum equation:

\[
(B - 3) + (B - 3 - 2) + B + (3B - 1) = 87
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
B - 3 + B - 5 + B + 3B - 1 = 87
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
6B - 9 = 87
\]

Add 9 to both sides:

\[
6B = 96
\]

Divide by 6:

\[
B = 16
\]

Now, substitute \( B = 16 \) back into the expression for \( M \):

\[
M = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13
\]

So, you are 13 years old.

"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for Mr. Jackson's class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find the number of packs required, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs to ensure he has enough glue sticks. To confirm, 6 packs would only provide:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 8 \text{ glue sticks/pack} = 48 \text{ glue sticks} \]

This is not enough since he needs 54 glue sticks. Therefore, he needs 7 packs to have at least 56 glue sticks, which is more than enough and ensures he has some extra glue sticks left over.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the changes in the amount of water passing through the river step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After Heavy Rain:**
   After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. Therefore, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Increase on the Third Day:**
   On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and then sum them up.

**Day 0:**
- Initially, 10 people are infected.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 1: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total infected after Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 2: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total infected after Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total amount as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ \$1520 \]"

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. Therefore, in a year (which has 12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, which means Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Therefore, in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

So, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a year."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the total number of banana bread loaves she baked. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, over 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has \(70 - 30 = 40\) silver coins.

\[70 + 40 = 110\]

So, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins."
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate to the total consumed by the students.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.

First, calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students:
\[ \text{Number of students} = 50 \]
\[ \text{Burritos per student} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Total burritos consumed by students} = 50 \times 10 = 500 \]

Next, add the number of burritos Mr. George ate:
\[ \text{Burritos eaten by Mr. George} = 20 \]
\[ \text{Total burritos consumed} = 500 + 20 = 520 \]

Finally, subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered:
\[ \text{Initial number of burritos} = 600 \]
\[ \text{Total burritos consumed} = 520 \]
\[ \text{Leftover burritos} = 600 - 520 = 80 \]

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. So, the number of green cars = 12 - 2 = 10.
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. So, the number of blue cars = 3 * 10 = 30.
4. The total number of cars in the rink is 75.

To find the number of yellow cars, we need to subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.

Total number of cars = Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars + Number of yellow cars

So, we can write the equation as:

75 = 12 + 10 + 30 + Number of yellow cars

Now, let's solve for the number of yellow cars:

75 = 52 + Number of yellow cars

Number of yellow cars = 75 - 52 = 23

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."
"To determine the weight of the carrots Daisy bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the weight of the bag of potatoes.
2. Calculate the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes.
3. Determine the weight of the bag of carrots based on the weight of the sweet potatoes.

Step 1: The weight of the bag of potatoes is given as 5 pounds.

Step 2: The weight of the bag of sweet potatoes is 2 times the weight of the bag of potatoes. Therefore, we calculate:
\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 3: The weight of the bag of carrots is 3 pounds fewer than the weight of the sweet potatoes. Therefore, we calculate:
\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the weight of the carrots Daisy bought is \(\boxed{7}\) pounds."
"First, let's determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of cups needed is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 cups. Since one three-ounce box makes 10 cups, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost. Since each box is on sale for $1.25, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Greg will spend on jello is:

1. **Cost per bottle of soda:**
   - 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - Cost per bottle of soda = \(\frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00\) dollars.

2. **Cost per bottle of water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Cost per bottle of water = \(\frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

3. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda:**
   - 3 bottles of soda at $3.00 each = \(3 \times 3.00 = 9.00\) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 2 bottles of water:**

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:**
   Isaias plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens.
   \[
   \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the chickens:**
   Isaias sells each chicken for $50.
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
   \]

3. **Determine the profit Isaias wants to make:**
   Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the chickens:**
   The total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the profit.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost per chicken:**
   The total cost of 180 chickens is $7000.
   \[
   \text{Cost per chicken} = \frac{7000}{180} \approx 38.89
   \]

Therefore, the amount Isaias bought the chickens for is approximately \(\boxed{38.89}\)."
"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah and Mitchell sold in total. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sales were 32 glasses, the boys together sold:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \text{ glasses} \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses equally between the two:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ glasses each} \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the costs for each service and then sum them up.

1. **Hair Treatment Cost:**
   Iris spent $400 on her hair treatment.

2. **Manicure Cost:**
   The cost of the manicure is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the hair treatment cost.
   \[
   \text{Manicure Cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]

3. **Pedicure Cost:**
   The cost of the pedicure is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the manicure cost.
   \[
   \text{Pedicure Cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

4. **Total Cost:**
   Now, we sum up the costs of all the services.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is \(\boxed{575}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will earn from selling the rope.

The rope is 20 meters long, and she can sell it for $2 per meter. Therefore, the total amount of money she will earn is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, let's determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and assuming she buys a rope of the same length (20 meters), the cost will be:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah earned to find out how much money she will have left over:
\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age as follows:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be 24. Since she is currently 8 years old, in \( x \) years, she will be:

\[ 8 + x \]

We set this equal to 24 and solve for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"First, let's break down the costs of each item:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   - Cost per pack of bacon: \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \) dollars.

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per packet of chicken: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for 6 packets of chicken: \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) dollars.

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Total cost for 3 packs of strawberries: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per pack of apples: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for 7 packs of apples: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) dollars.

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost of bacon: $10
- Total cost of chicken: $24
- Total cost of strawberries: $12
- Total cost of apples: $14

Total cost of all items:

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \(\boxed{25}\) minutes."

4. Subtract the number of toys given to Nicky.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Argo starts with 200 toys.
2. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa: \(200 - 40 = 160\).
3. He gives 80 toys to Bonnie: \(160 - 80 = 80\).
4. He gives 30 toys to Nicky: \(80 - 30 = 50\).

So, after giving away all the toys, Argo has \(\boxed{50}\) toys left."
"To find the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each of these days.

1. On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
2. On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
3. On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesdays or Wednesdays, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we add the chimichangas made on these three days:
\[ 125 \text{ (Tuesdays)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesdays)} + 250 \text{ (Fridays)} = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones will not be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He also counts \( \frac{2}{3} \) of that number of birds flying overhead. So, we calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) birds flying overhead.
3. He sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds feeding.

Now, we add all these numbers together to find the total number of birds Jerry counts:
\[ 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"Lani started with 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies, so the number of cookies left is:

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

Next, she placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies are in each jar, we divide 50 by 5:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, the number of cookies in each jar is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We do this by subtracting the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find out how many plants are left after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate the number of outdoor plants as follows:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the speed at which a whirligig spins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the speed of a thingamabob.
2. Use the speed of a thingamabob to find the speed of a whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11:

\[
\text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

\[
\text{Speed of a whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Thus, the speed at which a whirligig spins is:

\[
\boxed{55}

"To determine the cost of one carrot, let's break down the information given:

1. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
2. The salad costs $6.
3. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
4. The total cost for her daily goods is $11.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( C \). Since she eats two carrots each day, the cost for the carrots is \( 2C \).

The total cost for her daily goods can be expressed as:
\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot is $1.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 per hour and received a raise of $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours per week} \]

Now, we can calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that amount from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Then, the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3J \).
- The number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn is \( 5J \).

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for each mowing, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns as follows:
- Earnings from Joe's lawn: \( 6J \)
- Earnings from Kamala's lawn: \( 6 \times 3J = 18J \)
- Earnings from Alba's lawn: \( 6 \times 5J = 30J \)

The total earnings from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

We know that Tasha's total earnings last month were $80. Therefore, the earnings from lemonade sales can be calculated by subtracting the earnings from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
\[ 80 - 54J = \text{Earnings from lemonade sales} \]

To find \( J \), we need to determine a value that makes sense in the context of the problem. Since \( J \) must be a positive integer, let's assume the simplest case where \( J = 1 \):
\[ 54J = 54 \times 1 = 54 \]
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Thus, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"

"First, let's calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we calculate Anis's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + \left( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \right) = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance rowed on that day:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get \(\boxed{16}\) cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each read over the two days:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

**Final Answer:**
15"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with:
\[ 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ adult bowls} \]

These 2 adult bowls can be converted into child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, 2 adult bowls are equivalent to:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ child bowls} \]

Calvin has 4 child bowls of soup left after the adults have eaten. There are 2 children, and each child will have 1 bowl of soup. This means the children will consume:
\[ 2 \text{ child bowls} \]

After the children have eaten, the remaining soup is:
\[ 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ child bowls} \]

These 2 remaining child bowls can be divided among the 2 children. Therefore, each child will have:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ additional bowl of soup} \]

So, each child will be able to have 1 more bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

First, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- William bought 5 notebooks.

\[
\text{Cost of notebooks} = 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.
- William bought 1 ballpen.

\[
\text{Cost of ballpen} = 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
\]

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00

Therefore, William spent a total of \(\boxed{8.00}\)."
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we calculate the amount of material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

Next, we calculate the amount of material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Finally, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

So, the total amount of material Jo needs is \(\boxed{16}\) yards."

"First, let's break down Harold's daily activities and their durations:

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
- Time spent sleeping: 10 hours
- Time spent working: 8 hours
- Time spent walking the dog: 1 hour

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses and how many are left:

- Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes.
- He uses 3 blue shoe boxes for fishing.

Next, let's determine how many red shoe boxes Tim uses and how many are left:

- Tim starts with 9 red shoe boxes.
- He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes for fishing.
- Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes used is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3\).
- Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is \(9 - 3 = 6\).

So, the final number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box is 4 blue and 6 red.

Final numerical answer:
4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes are left."
"First, we determine how many books Joseph originally had. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, and Sarah has 9 books, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Joseph originally had 18 books. Next, we account for the fact that Joseph lost 2 of his books. We subtract 2 from the original number of books Joseph had:

\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]

Therefore, Joseph currently has \(\boxed{16}\) books."

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the current ages of Duncan and Adam. Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be \(\boxed{38}\) years old in 8 years."
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms combined, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We do this by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works in a day:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money he earns for completing 320 packages. Since he earns $0.20 for each package, we multiply the number of packages by the payment per package:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"

"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they had and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. The balloons: Since 1 dozen balloons is 12 balloons and they cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The ice cream: They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

This is the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had together. Since they had the same amount of allowance and combined it, the total amount of their allowances is $28. Therefore, each girl's allowance is:

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled by the bus.**
The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by the car.**
The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. Using the same formula:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

**Step 3: Determine how much farther the bus traveled than the car.**
Subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."

"Let's define the variables for the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as follows:
- Let \( P \) be the age of Peter.
- Let \( p \) be the age of Paul.
- Let \( j \) be the age of Jean.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
1. \( P + p + j = 100 \)
2. \( p = j + 10 \)
3. \( P = p + j \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( p \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (j + 10) + j = 2j + 10 \]

Now we have \( P \) in terms of \( j \). We can substitute \( P \) and \( p \) in the first equation:
\[ (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100 \]
Simplify the left side:
\[ 2j + 10 + j + 10 + j = 100 \]
\[ 4j + 20 = 100 \]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4j = 80 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ j = 20 \]

Now that we know \( j = 20 \), we can find \( p \) and \( P \):
\[ p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = p + j = 30 + 20 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \(\boxed{50}\)."

Now, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the initial 12-hour stay and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour. The additional hours are:
\[ 17 - 12 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The cost for the additional hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding the cost of the initial 12-hour stay:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Finally, we find the difference between the two costs to determine how much Cameron saves:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} - 1350 \text{ pesos} = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, Cameron would save:
\[ \boxed{250} \text{ pesos} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. According to the problem, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Subtracting 3 pounds from this amount gives:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total amounts of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the overall total:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Nate needs \(\boxed{159}\) pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John then deposits $100 in the bank, so his remaining money is:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money, we get:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many $25 pens John can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig has spelled to the number of letters his brother has spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ \boxed{650} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and the teacher has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[ \boxed{842} \]"
"To determine the total charge for the job, we need to consider the fixed visit charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Fixed Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: The labor rate is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). Therefore, the labor charge is \(3 \times 35 = 105\) dollars.
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total charge:
\[
40 + 105 + 60 = 205
\]

Thus, the total charge for the job is \(\boxed{205}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:**
   - James buys 10 CDs.
   - Each CD costs $15.
   - Total cost before discount = \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - The discount is 40%.
   - Discount amount = \( 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   - Total cost after discount = \( 150 - 60 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total amount James gets from selling 5 CDs:**
   - He sells 5 CDs for $40 each.
   - Total amount from selling = \( 5 \times 40 = 200 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the net amount James is out of pocket:**
   - Total cost after discount = $90.
   - Amount received from selling 5 CDs = $200.
   - Net amount out of pocket = \( 90 - 200 = -110 \) dollars.

Since the net amount is negative, it means James actually gained $110. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a loss. Therefore, the correct interpretation in the context of the question is that he did not lose any money and even gained $110.

**Final numerical answer:**
\[
\boxed{110}
\]"
"To determine how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

"To determine the total time James took to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   James swims at half the initial speed.
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   Add the time taken to swim the initial distance, the rest time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is \(\boxed{17}\) hours."
"To determine how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we start by identifying the number of loaves Sam had last Friday, which is given as 70 loaves.

The problem states that the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. We can express this mathematically as follows:

1. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had:
   \[
   7 \times 70 = 490
   \]

2. Subtract 40 from this result to find the number of loaves the bakery has:
   \[
   490 - 40 = 450
   \]

Therefore, the bakery has \(\boxed{450}\) loaves of bread."

"To determine Cayley's total commission, we need to calculate the commission from each type of newspaper separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- He sells 6 copies of the New York Times.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- He sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

Deanna's age = 26
Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21

Now, since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age.

Leo's age = 2 * Marcus's age = 2 * 21 = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar scored.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - 100 pages are stacked in 1 inch.
   - Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page per side.
   - The book is 1.5 inches thick.

2. **Calculate the number of pages per inch:**
   - Since 100 pages are in 1 inch, the number of pages per inch is 100.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:**
   - If 1 inch contains 100 pages, then 1.5 inches will contain:
     \[
     100 \text{ pages/inch} \times 1.5 \text{ inches} = 150 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Account for both sides of the paper:**
   - Since each paper is printed on both sides, each sheet of paper contributes 2 pages to the book.
   - Therefore, the total number of sheets of paper is:
     \[
     \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages/sheet}} = 75 \text{ sheets}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of pages:**
   - Each sheet of paper has 2 pages, so the total number of pages in the book is:
     \[
     150 \text{ pages}

"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate Kim's usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Determine the time Kim woke up that day:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - 6 a.m. minus 5 minutes is 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before getting out of bed:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. is 23 minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was asleep on the bed:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds initially = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200.
   - New admissions = 700.
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds = 900 beds.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

**Final Answer:**
The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails, which are not to family, are to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are sent to her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Finally, we need to determine how many of these 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. The problem states that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

"If Courtney reported 48 people in attendance and Kelly says that Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we need to find the actual number of people that attended the concert.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried in terms of Jeffrey's number of balls. Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan. Therefore, the total number of balls is:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then the relationship between the number of balls carried by each boy would still hold. If Jason carried 2 balls, then \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get:
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the expression for the total number of balls, we get:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes dug by the end of the third day before filling in any holes:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

Next, they filled in 2 holes on the third day:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, there were 29 holes.

The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10. Therefore, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \).

According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips. Since only two people got an equal amount of corn chips, and the third person (Collins) received 15 more corn chips than the others, we can express the number of corn chips Collins received as \( 70 + 15 = 85 \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of corn chips by summing the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[
70 + 70 + 85
\]

First, add the corn chips received by Amora and Lainey:
\[
70 + 70 = 140
\]

Next, add the corn chips received by Collins:
\[
140 + 85 = 225

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the third equation:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]

"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend watching all the episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Northerly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we calculate the net southerly distance by subtracting the northerly distance from the southerly distance:

- Total southerly distance: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Total northerly distance: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

Net southerly distance: \( 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \)

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day.

1. **Brownies made by Greta:**
   - Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 brownies, she made 12 brownies.

2. **Brownies received from the office party:**
   - She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office party.
   - 1/2 dozen equals 6 brownies.

3. **Brownies received from the surprise party:**
   - Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her.
   - 4 dozen equals 48 brownies.

4. **Total brownies before the party:**
   - Adding the brownies she made and the ones she received:
     \[
     12 \text{ (made by Greta)} + 6 \text{ (from office party)} + 48 \text{ (from surprise party)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
     \]

5. **Brownies eaten during the party:**
   - 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten during the party.
   - 1 1/2 dozen equals 18 brownies.

6. **Brownies left over:**
   - Subtract the brownies eaten from the total brownies:
     \[
     66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten during the party)} = 48 \text{ brownies}
     \]

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"First, let's determine the ages of each family member:

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother's age is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(0.25 \times 8 = 2\). Therefore, the sister's age is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years.

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is \(\boxed{30}\)."

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets is \(\boxed{227}\) minutes."
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, and each of the remaining 2 phones is at half price.

The full price of one phone is $600.

So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The cost for the next 2 phones (at half price) is:
\[ 2 \times \left(\frac{600}{2}\right) = 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

Therefore, John paid a total of $1800 for the phones."
"First, we determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players. Next, we find the total number of players in both teams combined by adding the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ 20 + 13 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wood slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

These 8 boxes are the ones she kept and possibly sold. She kept 1/4 of these boxes for herself:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes she kept from the boxes she had after giving some away:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

These 6 boxes are the ones she sold. Since each box contains 20 oranges, we calculate the total number of oranges she sold:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to afford the books. He has already saved $14, so the additional amount needed is:

Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:

Number of hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Number of hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both Saturday and Sunday, and then find the total earnings.

First, let's find out how many boxes of each item Sunny sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Let's denote the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday as \( G_{\text{Sun}} \) and the number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday as \( A_{\text{Sun}} \).

From the information given:
- \( G_{\text{Sun}} = 10 + 5 = 15 \) (gingerbread on Sunday)
- \( A_{\text{Sun}} = 15 \) (apple pie on Sunday)

Now, we can find the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday:
- \( A_{\text{Sat}} = A_{\text{Sun}} - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11 \) (apple pie on Saturday)

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of baked good over the two days.

**Total gingerbread boxes:**
- Saturday: 10
- Sunday: 15
- Total: \( 10 + 15 = 25 \)

**Total apple pie boxes:**
- Saturday: 11
- Sunday: 15
- Total: \( 11 + 15 = 26 \)

Now, we calculate the earnings from each type of baked good.

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
- Price per box: $6
- Total boxes: 25
- Total earnings: \( 25 \times 6 = 150 \)

**Earnings from apple pie:**
- Price per box: $15
- Total boxes: 26
- Total earnings: \( 26 \times 15 = 390 \)

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of baked goods to find the total earnings for the two days.

**Total earnings:**
- Gingerbread: $150

Thus, Sunny earned a total of \(\boxed{540}\) dollars for the two days."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need to pack, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use:**
   - Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She will be outside for 4 hours each day.
   - Over 8 days, the total number of hours she will be outside is:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is:
     \[
     32 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 32 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of bottles needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.
   - To find out how many bottles are needed, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount per bottle:

     \]

Thus, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the cost of the red car, we start by calculating 40% of the price of the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the red car is 40% cheaper, we subtract this amount from the price of the blue car:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, we add the cost of the blue car and the red car to find the total cost:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

Now, let's determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is:
\[43 + 7 = 50\]

So, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Let's break down the information given:

2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

Now, we add up all the beads:

- Beads from her mother: 20
- Beads from her sister: 30
- Beads from her friend: 40

Total beads = \(20 + 30 + 40 = 90\)

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we calculate the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"

"To determine how much money Pat will spend to fill her flower bed with plants, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the plants and the spacing to the same unit:**
   - Each plant grows 12 inches wide. Convert this to feet: \( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 1 \text{ foot} \).
   - The space between each plant is 1.5 feet.

2. **Calculate the total space required for one plant and the space between it and the next plant:**
   - Space for one plant and the space between it and the next plant: \( 1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet} \).

3. **Determine the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long. Divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for one plant and the space between it and the next plant: \( \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \).
   - Since Pat can only have whole plants, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants needed:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants. Subtract the number of plants she already has from the total number of plants needed: \( 44 - 17 = 27 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6. Multiply the number of additional plants by the cost per plant: \( 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"First, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by brother in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for each type of plant and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the total number of each type of plant needed:
- Each basket requires 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.
- Katherine has 5 baskets.

So, the total number of petunias needed is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias} \]

And the total number of sweet potato vines needed is:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ sweet potato vines} \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the petunias:
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Therefore, the total cost for the petunias is:
\[ 15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00 \]

Then, we calculate the cost for the sweet potato vines:
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the sweet potato vines is:
\[ 10 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00 \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the petunias and the sweet potato vines to find the total amount Katherine will spend:
\[ \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00 \]

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. Since they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. Since they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations to find the total soil used for these plants:
\[12 + 15 = 27\] pounds.

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the amount of soil left for planting roses is:
\[30 - 27 = 3\] pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[3 \div 1 = 3\].

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \text{ pairs} \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, let's calculate how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the task into two parts: peeling and sautéing.

1. **Peeling Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we calculate the time required as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, we calculate the time required as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to complete both tasks is the sum of the time to peel and the time to sauté:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \( D \).
   - According to the problem, \( D = 30 \) years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \( 90 - 75 = 15 \) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill.
   - Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes \(12\) checks for the electric bill.

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill.
   - Similarly, he writes \(12\) checks for the gas bill.

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church.
   - Therefore, he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) checks to the church.

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter (3 months) to the pest and lawn service.
   - There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes \(4\) checks to the pest and lawn service.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[ 12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52 \]

Thus, Buford writes a total of \(52\) checks per year.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips.
   - These 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips in one day.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's flights:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
   - Thus, the remaining flights are \( 88 - \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \) flights.
   - These 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each destination gets \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) flights.

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl**: Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote's howl**: Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. Therefore, Chikote's howl lasts for \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. **Igneous's howl**: Igneous howls for as long as the combined duration of Tobias's and Chikote's howls. Therefore, Igneous's howl lasts for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we calculate the total duration of all three howls combined:
\[
20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[
\frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to follow these steps:

"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. Akbar's age \( A = 3 \) years.
2. Alessandro's age \( B = 4 \) years.
3. The total age of the children is 20 years.
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age of the children as:
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( B \):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

Since \( H + W = 13 \), we can substitute this into the average age formula:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + 13}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Given that Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's define the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the total watermelon is divided into \( 8x \) parts.

Each adult gets \( 2x \) of these parts. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Total}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon."

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons needed.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The conversion factor is that 1 cubic foot of water is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
\[ G = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 7.48 \, \text{gallons per cubic foot} \]
\[ G = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per gallon} \]
\[ C = 1047.20 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge, accounting for the different rates of charge loss.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank is at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).

   \[
   x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
   \]

   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348

"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, making her total hourly earnings $25 per hour. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 1000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Janet wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. So, the amount she needs to save is:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000. Since she earns $1000 per week, the number of weeks required is:

\[ \frac{2000 \text{ dollars}}{1000 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased.

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total spent so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, let's determine the total number of sweets Anne has. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each of these 13 packs contains 60 pieces, so the total number of sweets given to her friends is:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since these 780 pieces were distributed equally among her 10 friends, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is:

"First, we need to determine how long it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time per page as follows:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time per page by the number of pages:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time James spends reading is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of guests**: The hotel starts with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkouts**: 24 guests checked out early.
   - Guests after early checkouts: \(100 - 24 = 76\)

3. **Late checkouts**: 15 guests checked out late.
   - Guests after late checkouts: \(76 - 15 = 61\)

4. **Afternoon check-ins**: Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   - Number of people who checked in: \(2 \times 15 = 30\)
   - Guests after afternoon check-ins: \(61 + 30 = 91\)

5. **Additional check-ins after dinner**: 7 more people checked in.
   - Final number of guests: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is **98**."
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we need to calculate the number of bananas he picked each day and then sum them up.

1. On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
3. On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

\[4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22\]

So, the total number of bananas John has is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions: 60
   - Percentage of easy questions: 40%
     \[
     \text{Number of easy questions} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24
     \]
   - The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions:
     \[
     \text{Number of average and difficult questions} = 60 - 24 = 36
     \]
     Since these are equally divided:
     \[
     \text{Number of average questions} = \text{Number of difficult questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, each small stuffed animal costs $4, so \( S = 4 \). Since a large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one, \( L = 3 \times 4 = 12 \).

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) because she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{Number of small stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of a small stuffed animal}) + (\text{Number of large stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of a large stuffed animal}) \]
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is \( x = 6 \), and the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the amount of ore one dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe.

1. With a bare hand, one dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is:
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is:
   \[
   24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

Now, we need to calculate how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days.

4. One dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine:
   \[
   40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]
5. Over 30 days, the total amount of ore mined is:

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich for each package and then use that information to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - Number of sandwiches: 2
   - Price: $3
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) dollars

2. For the second package:
   - Number of sandwiches: 4
   - Price: $6
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) dollars

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Number of sandwiches: 8
- Price per sandwich: $1.50
- Total cost: \(8 \times 1.5 = 12\) dollars

Thus, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is \(\boxed{12}\)."

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not have to turn in his homework and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50.
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Contribution to the probability of not having to turn in homework: \(0.50\).

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.50.
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40.
   - Combined probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension: \(0.50 \times 0.40 = 0.20\).
   - Contribution to the probability of not having to turn in homework: \(0.20\).

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets an Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.50.
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60.
   - Probability of Marcus getting an extension from the teacher: 20% or 0.20.
   - Combined probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus getting an extension: \(0.50 \times 0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.06\).
   - Contribution to the probability of not having to turn in homework: \(0.06\).

Now, we sum up all the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
\[0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76\]

The probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is the complement of the above probability:
\[1 - 0.76 = 0.24\]

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} + 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 1250 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn back the money he spent on college and the money he lost from not working, we need to calculate the total cost of his education and the lost income, and then find out how long it will take him to earn that amount at his new income level.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes 4 years to finish college.
   - He gets $50,000 in loans per year.
   - Total loan amount = \( 4 \text{ years} \times \$50,000 \text{ per year} = \$200,000 \).

2. **Calculate the lost income:**
   - Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year before college.
   - He did not work for 4 years.
   - Total lost income = \( 4 \text{ years} \times \$25,000 \text{ per year} = \$100,000 \).

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Total loan amount + Total lost income.
   - Total cost = \$200,000 + \$100,000 = \$300,000.

4. **Determine Jim's new income:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - His new income = \( 3 \times \$25,000 = \$75,000 \text{ per year} \).

5. **Calculate the time to earn back the total cost:**
   - Time to earn back the total cost = Total cost / New income per year.
   - Time to earn back the total cost = \$300,000 / \$75,000 per year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim \(\boxed{4}\) years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \] square feet."

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches since the final heights of both Cole and Xavier will be in inches.

1. **Xavier's height now:**
   - Xavier was originally 4 feet tall.
   - 1 foot = 12 inches, so 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
   - Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer.
   - Therefore, Xavier's current height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

2. **Cole's height now:**
   - Cole was originally 50 inches tall.
   - Cole grew 2 inches over the summer.
   - Therefore, Cole's current height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

3. **Difference in height between Cole and Xavier:**
   - Cole's height now = 52 inches.
   - Xavier's height now = 51 inches.
   - The difference = 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

"Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

First, combine the terms involving \( x \):
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot (2x) + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, meaning it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:
\[ \text{Value after depreciation} = \text{Initial value} \times (1 - \text{depreciation rate})^{\text{number of years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \(0.79^3\):
\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this result by the initial value:
\[ 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"
"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of English books:
   - Half of the 50 books are in English.
   - Number of English books = \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).

2. Calculate the number of German books:
   - 10% of the 50 books are in German.
   - Number of German books = \( 50 \times \frac{10}{100} = 5 \).

3. Calculate the number of Spanish books:
   - The rest of the books are in Spanish.
   - Number of Spanish books = Total number of books - Number of English books - Number of German books.
   - Number of Spanish books = \( 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \).

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is \( \boxed{20} \)."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Bernice has already driven. According to the problem, Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days. So, we multiply 325 kilometers by 4:

\[ 325 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 1300 \text{ km} \]

Next, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance between San Diego and New York City:

\[ 1955 \text{ km} - 1300 \text{ km} = 655 \text{ km} \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive:

\[ \boxed{655} \] kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of people on the train at the final stop.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards a train with 120 people.
   \[
   \text{Initial number of people} = 120
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after first stop} = 120 + 20 = 140
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after second stop} = 140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after third stop} = 190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Thus, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}

"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Tank top cost**: $10
2. **Running shorts cost**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis shoes cost**: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic socks cost**: Package originally $8, with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent **$55** on athletic gear."
"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}\).

The total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is **$2400**."
"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The insurance is 60% more than the normal cost of $120.

To find 60% of $120:
\[ 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the increased cost per month is $72. Adding this to the normal cost:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

This means the new monthly cost of the insurance is $192. To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used per week:**
   - Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week.
   - Greg uses 1 king sheet per week.
   - Total sheets per week = 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sheets.

2. **Determine the number of loads needed per week:**
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time.
   - Since 4 twin sheets are used per week, it will take 2 loads to wash all the twin sheets (2 sets per load).
   - 1 king sheet per week requires 1 load.
   - Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads.

3. **Calculate the total number of loads per year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day. Since she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams each time, the daily consumption is:

\[ 60 \, \text{grams/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 120 \, \text{grams/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{120 \, \text{grams/day}} = 6 \, \text{days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of slices each person ate in terms of Jake's slices.

Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate \( J + 3 \) slices.
- Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \( 2J \) slices.
- Becky ate 10 slices, so we can set up the equation \( J + 3 = 10 \).

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J + 3 = 10 \]
\[ J = 10 - 3 \]
\[ J = 7 \]

So, Jake ate 7 slices. Now we can find out how many slices Silvia ate:
\[ 2J = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now we know:
- Becky ate 10 slices.
- Jake ate 7 slices.
- Silvia ate 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add these amounts together:
\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's time can be expressed as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the time spent by Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( D \). We do this by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part of the meal took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's time as:
\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, the number of minutes long Betsy's part was is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to break down each charge and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is:
   \[
   300 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of painkillers**: Each pill costs $4, and she needs 30 pills, so the cost is:
   \[
   4 \text{ dollars/pill} \times 30 \text{ pills} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the cost is:

"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left from their order.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left from their order.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"

5. **Determine the number of additional sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - \(3 \text{ sub sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sub sandwich} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

6. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches:**
   - The remaining sub sandwiches are the initial 3 sub sandwiches minus the 4 that Mark ate, plus the additional 3 sub sandwiches.
   - \(3 \text{ sub sandwiches} - 4 \text{ sub sandwiches} + 3 \text{ sub sandwiches} = 2 \text{ sub sandwiches}\).
   - \(2 \text{ sub sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sub sandwich} = 8 \text{ meatballs}\).

Therefore, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

"To determine the cost for Dennis to purchase the butter, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is:
     \[
     4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The effective cost per pound of butter is:
     \[
     \frac{6.00}{1.5} = 4.00 \text{ dollars per pound}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   Since the effective cost per pound remains $4.00, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is:
   \[
   6 \text{ pounds} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars per pound} = 24.00 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who said they could not come. Therefore, the number of guests who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests. For each additional guest beyond the first 20, the cost is $6. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for these additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the base rental fee to the cost of the additional guests gives us the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"Let's start by determining how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

1. **Maggie's Initial Amount:**
   - Maggie spent a quarter of her money and was left with $60.
   - Let \( M \) be the initial amount of money Maggie had.
   - Maggie spent \(\frac{1}{4}M\), so she has \(\frac{3}{4}M\) left.
   - We know \(\frac{3}{4}M = 60\).
   - Solving for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
     \]
   - Therefore, Maggie initially had $80.

2. **Riza's Initial Amount:**
   - Riza spent one-third of her money and was left with $60.
   - Let \( R \) be the initial amount of money Riza had.
   - Riza spent \(\frac{1}{3}R\), so she has \(\frac{2}{3}R\) left.
   - We know \(\frac{2}{3}R = 60\).
   - Solving for \( R \):
     \[
     R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
     \]
   - Therefore, Riza initially had $90.

3. **Money Spent by Each:**
   - Maggie spent \(\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\) dollars.
   - Riza spent \(\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30\) dollars.

4. **Money Left:**
   - Maggie has $60 left.
   - Riza has $60 left.

5. **Total Money Left:**
   - The total amount of money left is:

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which are enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we calculate the daily banana consumption for each monkey:

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
3. Let the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day be \(x\).

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[10 + 14 + x = 24 + x\]

Since this amount is the daily consumption, the total consumption for a week (7 days) is:
\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]
\[24 + x = \frac{315}{7}\]
\[24 + x = 45\]
\[x = 45 - 24\]
\[x = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}

Half of a 500 piece puzzle is:
\[ \frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Teddy finished 250 pieces from the first puzzle and all 500 pieces from the second puzzle.

The total number of pieces Teddy placed during that hour is:
\[ 250 + 500 = 750 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. The florist can only give change in quarters. Since 1 quarter is $0.25, we need to determine how many quarters make up $5:

\[ \$5 \div \$0.25/\text{quarter} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the earnings from each item separately and then sum them up.

"Let's break down the timeline step by step to determine when Paul's train arrives and how long he waits.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves 30 minutes after it arrives (10 + 20).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Leaves 35 minutes after it arrives (30 + 5).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it arrives and leaves at the same time.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, the fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train arrives.

Now, let's calculate the exact times:

- First train arrives at 10 minutes.
- First train leaves at 30 minutes.
- Second train arrives at 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes.
- Second train leaves at 60 minutes + 5 minutes = 65 minutes.
- Third train arrives and leaves at 65 minutes.
- Fourth train arrives at 65 minutes + 20 minutes = 85 minutes.

Paul arrives at the station at 0 minutes and his train (the fourth train) arrives at 85 minutes. Therefore, he waits for 85 minutes.

**Final Answer:**
85 minutes"
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already collected. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total required:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price of $2000.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch. The original price of the watch was $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800.

The discount amount is:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of seconds in 4 hours is:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 14400 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create:
     \[
     14400 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create:
     \[
     5 \times 14400 = 72000 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is:

"To find Frankie's score, we start by defining the relationship between Frankie's score and Binkie's score. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. Let's denote Binkie's score as \( B \) and Frankie's score as \( F \).

Given:
\[ B = 90 \]
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to consider the total distance he walked and his walking speed.

1. The distance from James's home to the store is 4 miles.
2. James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
3. He then had to walk back home, covering another 2 miles.
4. Therefore, the total distance James walked is \(2 + 2 = 4\) miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find the time it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

So, the total time it took James to reach the store is \(\boxed{1}\) hour."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00, so the total cost for 10 bunches is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying the bunches from the cost of buying the bananas individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the net number of bales added to or removed from the field each hour and then extend that over the 6-hour workday.

1. **Calculate the number of bales made by the farmer each hour:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.

2. **Calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck each hour:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.

3. **Calculate the net number of bales added to the field each hour:**
   - Net bales per hour = Bales made - Bales picked up
   - Net bales per hour = 5 - 3 = 2 bales

4. **Calculate the total number of bales added to the field over 6 hours:**
   - Total bales added = Net bales per hour * Number of hours
   - Total bales added = 2 * 6 = 12 bales

5. **Determine the number of bales left in the field:**
   - Since the field starts with 0 bales (assuming no initial bales), the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is the total bales added.
   - Number of bales left = 12

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field is **12**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

This is the time spent in classes from Monday to Friday. Now, let's calculate the time spent on extra learning on Saturday and Sunday.

John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each of these days.

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 320 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time.

\[ 320 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, John spends 6 hours a week learning."
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial drop height is:
   \[
   3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
   \[
   72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
   \[
   48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."

"To determine how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bags sold.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the price per bag.

First, we find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples and the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples per bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag. The price per bag is $5:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{1080} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\]

So, the cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\)."

"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, the distance it covers is:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
   \]
   After 3 hours, the distance it covers is:
   \[
   30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each has traveled:
   \[
   180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, the two trains are \(\boxed{270}\) miles apart after 3 hours."

"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry, as these are the people who attended the ceremony.

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

\[
12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people per bus} = 420 \text{ people}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

\[
20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people per car} = 60 \text{ people}
\]

Now, we add the number of people from the buses and the cars to find the total number of people who attended the ceremony:

\[
420 \text{ people from buses} + 60 \text{ people from cars} = 480 \text{ people}

Thus, Jeff is \(\boxed{30}\) years old."
"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to ride the biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to ride the second biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{second biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second biggest}}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch each day.
- He also takes two 15-minute breaks each day, which totals \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes.

So, the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 30 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, the daily total is 1 hour.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunches and breaks is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."
"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran \(\boxed{16}\) miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the new balance on Sheila's credit card.

1. **Initial Charge:**
   Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.

2. **Return of Item:**
   She returned an item that cost $15.00. This reduces her balance.
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **New Purchase:**
   Sheila bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00.
   \[
   \text{Discount on frying pan} = 20\% \times 20.00 = 0.20 \times 20.00 = 4.00
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of frying pan} = 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

4. **Additional Purchase:**
   She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00.
   \[
   \text{Discount on towels} = 10\% \times 30.00 = 0.10 \times 30.00 = 3.00
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of towels} = 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]

5. **Total New Purchases:**
   Adding the cost of the frying pan and the towels:
   \[
   16.00 + 27.00 = 43.00
   \]

6. **Final Balance:**
   Adding the new purchases to the remaining balance after the return:
   \[
   70.00 + 43.00 = 113.00
   \]

Thus, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is:
\[
\boxed{113.00}

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{J}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To determine Caroline's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Chris is 4 years old.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris. Therefore, we calculate Ben's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Ben's age} = 2 \times \text{Chris's age} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben. Therefore, we calculate Caroline's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24
   \]

Thus, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount based on her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement expense:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement expense} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live off this amount for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount Lauren saves per paycheck:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her $100,000 salary each year.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of years needed to save the total retirement amount:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement."
"First, we need to determine the length of each of the 4 equal parts of the ribbon. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon, and he needs to cut it into 4 equal parts. So, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]

Each of these 4 parts is 25 centimeters long. Next, each of these 25-centimeter parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. So, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total population of the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school by \( P \).

Given that 40% of \( P \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total height of the heels:
- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
- Therefore, the total height of all the heels is \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

Next, we need to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches}
\]

So, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in June.
2. Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike.
3. Calculate the number of miles she plans to hike per day.
4. Determine the difference between the miles she plans to hike per day and the miles she needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in June.**
June has 30 days.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike.**
Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of miles she plans to hike per day.**
Soledad plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total miles she plans to hike per day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

**Step 4: Determine the difference between the miles she plans to hike per day and the miles she needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time.**
To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we need to calculate the required miles per day to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we find the difference between the required miles per day and the miles she plans to hike per day:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike \(\boxed{60}\) more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

Therefore, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's determine how many kilograms of apples Pierre and Paul want.

Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants one-third of the 12 kg of apples:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we add the amounts that Pierre and Paul want to find out how many kilograms of apples they will take together:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total, we subtract the 7 kg that Pierre and Paul want from the total to find out how many kilograms Jacques will have left:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, James will have \(\boxed{5}\) kilograms of apples left."
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so the new temperature was:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Raymond has after saving from his allowance:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the amount he spent on the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the cost of each book, let's break down the information given:

1. Anna's initial budget: $16
2. Amount spent so far: $4
3. Amount left in the budget: $2
4. Number of books bought: 2
5. Cost of each book: Let's denote this as \( x \).

First, we calculate the total amount spent on the books:
\[ \text{Total spent} = \text{Initial budget} - \text{Amount left} = 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Since Anna spent $4 initially and then spent the rest on the books, the amount spent on the books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and each book cost the same amount, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, the cost of each book is \( \boxed{5} \)."

"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks. The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We can calculate the blinking rate as follows:

\[ \text{Blinking rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

Now, we perform the division:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

\[ \boxed{9} \]"

- Initial male guppies: 4
- Initial female guppies: 7
- Initial male goldfishes: 3
- Initial female goldfishes: 5

Next, we add the new fish Tate buys:

- New male guppies: 2
- New female guppies: 1
- New male goldfishes: 2
- New female goldfishes: 3

Now, we calculate the total number of each type of fish:

- Total male guppies: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Total female guppies: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
- Total male goldfishes: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- Total female goldfishes: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

Next, we find the total number of male and female fishes:

- Total male fishes: \(6 + 5 = 11\)
- Total female fishes: \(8 + 8 = 16\)

Finally, we determine how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has:

\[16 - 11 = 5\]

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's break down the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. **Amalia's time**: Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
2. **Megan's time**: Megan's chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's. Therefore, Megan took \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours to walk the dog.
3. **Dior's time**: Dior's chore took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's. Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior took more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. The problem does not specify an exact number, but it states ""well over 4 hours longer,"" so we can assume the minimum time Dior took is just over 8 hours. For the sake of calculation, we'll use 9 hours as a reasonable minimum (since ""well over"" suggests a time significantly more than 8 hours, but we need a specific number for the calculation).

Now, we sum up the time each person took:
- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 9 hours

Adding these times together:
\[ 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 \]

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\) hours."
"To determine how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days can be calculated by dividing the distance Sofie walks by 2:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers and then find out how many toys are still needed to meet the order, which will help us find the production rate of the fifth worker.

First, let's calculate the total production of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- They work for 10 hours.
- Therefore, each of these two workers produces \(6 \times 10 = 60\) toys.
- Together, they produce \(60 \times 2 = 120\) toys.

Next, let's calculate the total production of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- They work for 10 hours.
- Therefore, each of these two workers produces \(4 \times 10 = 40\) toys.
- Together, they produce \(40 \times 2 = 80\) toys.

Now, let's find the total production of the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 120 toys.
- The next two workers produce 80 toys.
- Together, they produce \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the first four workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

The fifth worker works for 10 hours, so the production rate of the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Therefore, the number of toys per hour the fifth worker produces is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:
\[
\boxed{105}

   - Kris gave Rob 7 stickers and kept 9 for herself.
   - Therefore, Kris had \(7 + 9 = 16\) stickers before giving any to Rob.

2. **Kris received 16 stickers from Luis.**
   - Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, meaning Kris received half of what Luis had.
   - Therefore, Luis had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers before giving any to Kris.

3. **Luis received 32 stickers from Seth.**
   - Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, meaning Luis received half of what Seth had.
   - Therefore, Seth had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers in the beginning.

So, Seth originally had **64 stickers**."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

\[ 3 \text{ large bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per large bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many M&M are in these 30 ounces. Since there are 30 M&M in an ounce:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M} \]

John wants to put 10 M&M in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M by the number of M&M per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M}}{10 \text{ M&M per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags."
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance that is half of the way around the earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to cover that distance given his daily flying distance.

First, the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of the way around the earth would be:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by his daily flying distance:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**
   - The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
   - The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine the speed of the fastest car:**
   - The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}

"Let's define the number of eggs painted by each person with variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know:
- Arnold painted 13 eggs.
- Madeline painted 13 eggs.
- Camden painted 21 eggs.
- Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the length of the usable part of the tree:**
   - The tree is 80 feet tall.

   - Total earnings = \( 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \) dollars.

Therefore, John makes \(\boxed{96}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000 and her brother earns $10000, so together they earn:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we find the total amount of money they all have together by adding Valerie's salary, her brother's salary, and their mother's salary:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to calculate the time spent on both the beach and the sidewalk.

First, we know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. Since the beach portion of the trail is 2 miles, we can find her speed on the beach by dividing the distance by the time:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}. \]

Next, we know that Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}. \]

The sidewalk portion of the trail is 1 mile. Using her speed on the sidewalk, we can find the time spent walking on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}. \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}. \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She saves $4 every week and has been saving for 8 weeks.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal.

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings.

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

\[ \boxed{7} \]"

"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if we subtract the 24 marbles he receives from the total of 60 marbles, we can find out how many marbles he originally has:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Next, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, we subtract 10 from his original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we need to ensure that after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into the water bottle, the resulting mixture is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into the water bottle, the resulting mixture will be a weighted average of the two temperatures. The formula for the resulting temperature \( T_{\text{result}} \) is:

\[
T_{\text{result}} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{4 + 1}
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
T_{\text{result}} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

We know that Donny can drink the water if the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To solve for \( T \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Next, we subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Thus, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after pouring the specified amounts.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over that period and then sum them with the initial numbers.

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost of $40.00. A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the original cost:

\[ 90\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.90 \times \$40.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:

\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**

   \[
   23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
   \]

2. **Find out how many scoops make up 1 less than 3 scoops:**
   1 less than 3 scoops is:
   \[
   3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops}
   \]

3. **Determine how many potatoes are needed for 2 scoops of mashed potatoes:**
   It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, we need to find out how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops.
   \[
   \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ sets of 2 scoops}
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops is:
   \[
   9 \times 3 = 27 \text{ potatoes}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

1. **First 30 days:**
   - Chester eats 3 eggs per day.
   - Total eggs for 30 days = \(3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}\).

2. **Next 30 days:**
   - Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day.
   - Total eggs for the next 30 days = \(5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}\).

3. **Total eggs for 60 days:**
   - Total eggs = \(90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}\).

4. **Convert eggs to dozens:**
   - Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, the total dozens of eggs = \(\frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}\).

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially based on the given ratio and total number of passengers.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 9 = 14\).

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the total number of passengers by the total parts of the ratio:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6
\]

Next, we calculate the number of men and women:
\[
\text{Number of men} = 5 \times 6 = 30
\]
\[
\text{Number of women} = 9 \times 6 = 54

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - So, he sells 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells a quarter of the remaining land for $30.
   - A quarter of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - So, he sells 10 square meters for $30.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money from the final sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - Adding up all the money he earned from the sales:
     - First sale: $50
     - Second sale: $30
     - Final sale: $90
   - Total earnings: \( 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is \(\boxed{170}\)."

"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Face masks used per outing:**
   Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.

2. **Number of outings per day:**
   Tyrion goes out three times a day.

3. **Face masks used per day:**
   Since he changes his mask two times per outing and goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ masks/outing} \times 3 \text{ outings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]

4. **Face masks used in 2 days:**
   To find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks used per day by 2:
   \[
   6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
   \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses \(\boxed{12}\) face masks every 2 days."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total eggs hidden by Cole**: Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

2. **Eggs found by Lamar**: Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. **Eggs found by Stacy**: Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar. So, Stacy finds \(2 \times 5 = 10\) eggs.

4. **Eggs found by Charlie**: Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy. So, Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

5. **Eggs found by Mei**: Mei finds half as many as Charlie. So, Mei finds \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by all the children:
- Lamar: 5 eggs
- Stacy: 10 eggs
- Charlie: 8 eggs
- Mei: 4 eggs

The total number of eggs found is \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
\[36 - 27 = 9\]

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so combined they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1248}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree over its first 10 years of life.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 3 \times 50 = 150 \) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 7 \times 50 = 350 \) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - Let the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree be \( x \).
   - Therefore, the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree is \( x - 200 \).

5. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 20 \times 50 = 1000 \) fruits.
   - So, \( x = 1000 \).
   - Therefore, the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree is \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) fruits.

6. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Does not produce any fruits.
   - \( 0 \) fruits.

7. **Total fruits produced over 10 years:**
   - Sum of fruits produced each year.
   - \( 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 \).

Now, let's add these values together:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = 2450
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is:
\[
\boxed{2450}

\[ \text{Jack's total amount} = 100 + 20 = 120 \]

So, Jack now has $120."
"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope in centimeters.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope in centimeters.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope in centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R = 4B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Next, substitute \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ B = 12 - 7 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Finally, we can find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B \]
\[ R = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to her little sister. Since Ronnie also gave an equal amount of money to his little sister, he also gave $3. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how many pints of red paint were used in the mural, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total amount of paint used:**
   The mural used a total of 12 pints of paint.

2. **Determine the proportion of yellow paint:**
   Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining paint for the other colors:**
   Since the total paint is 12 pints and 6 pints are yellow, the remaining paint for red, white, and purple is:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

4. **Determine the amount of red paint:**
   The problem states that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Therefore, the remaining 6 pints of paint are divided equally among these three colors. So, the amount of red paint is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
   \]

Thus, the number of pints of red paint used is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of clouds each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the number of clouds counted each day:
\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of clouds Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 0.20 \times 100 \text{ pods} = 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, the cost per cycle is $0.10. To find out how many cycles can be run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per cycle:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per cycle}} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before he has to recycle it, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday = 5 inches - (45% of 5 inches) = 5 inches - (0.45 * 5 inches) = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage:**
   - The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day.
   - Daily usage = 20% of the remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the number of days before the chalk is recycled:**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the remaining chalk to fall below 2 inches.

Let's denote the remaining chalk after \( n \) days as \( C_n \).

- Initial remaining chalk \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches.
- Daily usage = 20% of the remaining chalk.

The remaining chalk after each day can be calculated as:
\[ C_{n+1} = C_n - 0.2 \times C_n = 0.8 \times C_n \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( C_n < 2 \) inches.

Let's calculate the remaining chalk for each day:

- After 1 day: \( C_1 = 0.8 \times 2.75 = 2.2 \) inches.
- After 2 days: \( C_2 = 0.8 \times 2.2 = 1.76 \) inches.

Since \( C_2 = 1.76 \) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 2 days.

Therefore, the teacher has \(\boxed{2}\) days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of teeth drilled:**
   The dentist drills 4 teeth.

2. **Calculate the number of teeth capped:**
   The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:
   \[
   4 + 7 = 11
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of teeth fixed:**
   The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:

"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin using variables. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

**Step 1: Translate the first piece of information into an equation.**

Colin's age in seven years is \( C + 7 \). According to the problem, Wendy's current age \( W \) is five times this value:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

**Step 2: Translate the second piece of information into an equation.**

In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \). According to the problem, this age is a third of Wendy's current age \( W \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

**Step 3: Solve the system of equations.**

First, we have:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:**
   - Bob can buy 100 books for $500.
   - To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000, we divide $27000 by $500:
     \[
     \frac{27000}{500} = 54
     \]
   - Therefore, Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books, which totals:
     \[
     54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of books per school:**
   - Bob distributes the $27000 equally among 3 schools.
   - To find out how many books each school gets, we divide the total number of books by 3:
     \[

"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picked up the two apples.

2. **First Action:**
   - Newton put one apple in his pocket.
   - Newton threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up these 5 apples.
   - Newton put all but one of these 5 apples in his pocket.
   - Newton threw the remaining one apple at the tree.

3. **Second Action:**
   - Newton picked up all of the remaining apples (which were 4, since he put 4 in his pocket and threw 1 at the tree).
   - Newton went home to make a pie.

Now, let's count the apples Newton brought home:

- Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples.
- After the first action, he put 4 apples in his pocket (1 + 4 from the 5 that fell).
- After the second action, he picked up 4 more apples and put them in his pocket.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is the sum of the apples he put in his pocket after each action:

\[ 1 \text{ (first action)} + 4 \text{ (second action)} = 5 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of:

"To determine the total number of miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the miles run on the days Sam ran 3 miles:
- Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
- This totals to \(3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}\).

Next, let's calculate the miles run on the days Sam ran 5 miles:
- Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday.
- This totals to \(5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}\).

Now, we add the miles run on the days with 3 miles to the miles run on the days with 5 miles:
- Total miles = \(9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}\).

Therefore, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Building Snowballs:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour.

2. **Rate of Snowball Melting:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the number of 15-minute intervals in an hour is \( \frac{60}{15} = 4 \).
   - Therefore, the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Increase:**
   - The net rate at which Jay's snowball count increases is the rate of building minus the rate of melting.
   - Net rate = \( 20 - 8 = 12 \) snowballs per hour.

4. **Time to Reach 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find out how many hours it takes to reach 60 snowballs at a net rate of 12 snowballs per hour, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate.
   - Time = \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary:**
   - Since the question does not specify the current year, we can assume that the current year is the year of Digimon's 20th anniversary. Therefore, the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary is 20 years.

2. **Calculate John's age 20 years ago:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age 20 years ago:**
   - According to the problem, 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - Let \(x\) be Jim's age 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, \(8 = 2x\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = \frac{8}{2} = 4\).

4. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, Jim's current age is \(4 + 20 = 24\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, which means her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, which means he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices together:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

So, the final numerical answer is:
6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered enough to cover the deficit and have some left over. So, they ordered \(28 - 12 = 16\) more bandages to cover the deficit and have 50 - 16 = 34 bandages at the end of the second day.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = 2 * 50 = 100
   - Bandages used: \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\)

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information. Let's re-evaluate the bandages at the end of the second day correctly:

- Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\), so they ordered 28 more bandages to cover the deficit, making it \(12 - 28 + 28 = 12\).

Now, for the third day:
- Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = 100
- Bandages used: 25
- Bandages at the end of the third day: \(12 + 100 - 25 = 87\)

Since the problem states they had 78 bandages left, we need to adjust the initial number of bandages they started with on the first day. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \(x\).

- After the first day: \(x - 38 + 50 = x + 12\)
- After the second day: \(x + 12 - 28 + 28 = x + 12\)
- After the third day: \(x + 12 + 100 - 25 = x + 87\)

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages, so:
\[x + 87 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 87\]
\[x = -9\]

Since the initial number of bandages can't be negative, we need to recheck the steps. The correct initial number of bandages they started with is:
\[x = 78 - 87 + 50 = 41\]

So, the initial number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{41}\)."
"To determine the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of the color**: The cost for the color is a fixed amount of $40.

2. **Cost of the haircut**: The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means the hair was cut by 2 inches (10 - 8 = 2).

   Therefore, the cost for the haircut is:
   \[
   2 \text{ inches} \times \$30 \text{ per inch} = \$60
   \]

3. **Total cost**: To find the total cost, we add the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut:
   \[
   \$40 + \$60 = \$100
   \]

Thus, the total cost of May's cut and color is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"To determine how much Jen will receive in April, we need to calculate her earnings from her hourly wage and add the bonus for perfect attendance.

1. **Calculate Jen's weekly earnings:**
   - Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week.
   - Her hourly rate is $1.5.
   - Weekly hours worked: \( 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 45 \text{ hours/week} \).
   - Weekly earnings from hourly wage: \( 45 \text{ hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5 \text{ per week} \).

2. **Calculate Jen's monthly earnings:**
   - There are 4 weeks in April.

"To determine how much money Jason earned over the two-week period, we need to calculate the earnings from each task and then sum them up.

1. **Emptying the dishwasher**: Jason earns $0.50 each time he empties the dishwasher. He did this 6 times.
   \[
   6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
   \]

2. **Doing his laundry**: Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry once.
   \[
   1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
   \]

3. **Cleaning his room**: Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room once.
   \[
   1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Taking the trash to the curb**: Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb each week. He did this twice.
   \[
   2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
   \]

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[
3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jason earned is:
\[
\boxed{9.00}

"First, we need to determine the amount of blood a single shark has. According to the information provided, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood a shark has as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have in total. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by 10:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of blood that ten sharks have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (morning) had entered. Since 50 people came in the morning, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all these numbers:
\[ 50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320 \]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red pens.
2. Calculate the number of black pens.
3. Add the number of red pens and black pens together.

First, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we know that the number of black pens is twice the number of red pens. Therefore, the total number of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens together to find the total number of pens:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Thus, the total number of pens Alain has is:

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day Planting:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. This means he planted \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Total White Oak trees planted over the two days: \(20 + 30 = 50\).
   - Total Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days: \(40 + 50 = 90\).
   - Therefore, the total number of trees planted is \(50 + 90 = 140\).

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \( \boxed{8} \)."
"First, let's determine how many fish have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, 22 fish have red stripes. Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes. To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy has two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors.
     \[
     2 \text{ palettes} \times 4 \text{ colors per palette} = 8 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Amy has three makeup sets, each with 6 colors.
     \[
     3 \text{ sets} \times 6 \text{ colors per set} = 18 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Total initial eyeshadow colors:
     \[
     8 \text{ colors from palettes} + 18 \text{ colors from sets} = 26 \text{ colors}
     \]

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette is stolen, which had 4 colors.
     \[
     26 \text{ colors} - 4 \text{ colors} = 22 \text{ colors}
     \]

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors, and Amy uses up half of them.
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ colors}}{2} = 3 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - After using 3 colors, the remaining colors from that set are:
     \[
     6 \text{ colors} - 3 \text{ colors} = 3 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - The total number of colors from the remaining two sets and the one partially used set is:
     \[
     12 \text{ colors from the other two sets} + 3 \text{ colors from the partially used set} = 15 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Adding the remaining colors from the palettes:
     \[
     15 \text{ colors} + 4 \text{ colors from the remaining palette} = 19 \text{ colors}

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Mattison's height = 60 inches.
2. His house is 7 times as high as he is.
3. The first floor to ceiling height is thrice his height.

Now, let's calculate each part:

1. Height of the house = 7 * Mattison's height = 7 * 60 inches = 420 inches.
2. First floor to ceiling height = 3 * Mattison's height = 3 * 60 inches = 180 inches.

To find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, we need to subtract the first floor to ceiling height from the total height of the house:

Height from the second floor's floor to the roof = Total height of the house - First floor to ceiling height
= 420 inches - 180 inches
= 240 inches.

So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 240 inches."
"First, let's determine how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

This means team Alphas found 280 shells. Now, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, we calculate how many shells team The finders found. They found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells after team Alphas found theirs:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's denote the miles the last dog needs to walk as \( x \).

We know the following:
- The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
- The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
- The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.
- The average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles.

The formula for the average is the total miles walked divided by the number of dogs. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[
\frac{1 + 4 + 3 + x}{4} = 3
\]

To find \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to clear the denominator:

\[
1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12
\]

Next, we simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
8 + x = 12
\]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:

\[
x = 4
\]

So, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of his home's value.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts by subtracting the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John has leftover after paying his debts is:

\[ \boxed{40000} \]"

"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

To perform the multiplication:

\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children.
2. Determine how many of these changes are done by Jordan's wife.
3. Subtract the number of changes done by Jordan's wife from the total number of changes to find out how many changes Jordan does.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day.
Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children.
\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Step 2: Determine how many of these changes are done by Jordan's wife.

"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. Since a bookcase has one top shelf, one bottom shelf, and two middle shelves, the total capacity is:
\[15 + 20 + 2 \times 10 = 15 + 20 + 20 = 55 \text{ books}\]

Next, we need to determine how many bookcases Elly needs to hold all 110 books. We do this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Rose will sell these sets for $1 each. Therefore, the total revenue from selling the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test. We subtract the number of questions she has already answered correctly from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get \(\boxed{35}\) questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade."
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) is given by the formula:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) into the total equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \).

"To determine the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **Initial Value:**
   The initial value of the boat is $9000.

2. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

3. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

4. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882

"Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for half of the collection and $7 per toy for the other half.

First, we calculate the number of toys in each half:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, 6 toys will be sold at $5 each, and the other 6 toys will be sold at $7 each.

Next, we calculate the earnings from the first half:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Then, we calculate the earnings from the second half:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount Matthew would earn:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

Therefore, if Matthew agrees to the offer, he would earn:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes net reduction/day} \]

We need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a net rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's running speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's running speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - If Aaron's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \), then Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \).
   - To run 4 miles, the time taken is \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 4 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes} \).

"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed based on the length of the dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed. Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed. He already has 6 feet of line, so the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy \(\boxed{594}\) feet of line."

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
\[
20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
\]

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of mechanic's labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( C \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( K \) be the number of cows.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + K = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
