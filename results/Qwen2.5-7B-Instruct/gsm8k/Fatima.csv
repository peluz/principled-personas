"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs she uses is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs that she sells at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the amount she makes from selling the eggs is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts."
"To calculate Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the house and repairs.
2. Calculate the increased value of the house after repairs.
3. Subtract the total cost from the increased value to find the profit.

Step 1: Total cost of the house and repairs
- Cost of the house: $80,000
- Cost of repairs: $50,000
- Total cost: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Step 2: Calculate the increased value of the house
- The value of the house increased by 150% after repairs.
- To find the increased value, we calculate 150% of the total cost and add it to the total cost.
- 150% of $130,000 = 1.5 * $130,000 = $195,000
- Increased value of the house: $130,000 + $195,000 = $325,000

Step 3: Calculate the profit
- Profit = Increased value of the house - Total cost
- Profit = $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000

Final numerical answer:
$195,000"
"James runs 3 sprints, each 60 meters, 3 times a week. 

So, the total distance he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters a week."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken eats in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily feed requirement to find the final meal amount.

Step 1: Each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day.

Step 2: Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total for these two meals is:
15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Step 3: The total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens is:
20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Now, subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily requirement to find the final meal amount:
60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

20 cups"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of 16 glasses, where every second glass is 60% of the regular price.

1. The regular price of one glass is $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 16 glasses:

- For the first glass, the cost is $5.
- For the second glass, the cost is $3.
- For the third glass, the cost is $5.
- For the fourth glass, the cost is $3.
- And so on...

Since the pattern repeats every two glasses, we can group the glasses into pairs. There are 16 glasses, so there are 8 pairs.

The cost for each pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Therefore, the total cost for 16 glasses is 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
Charleston = 4 * Seattle
Charleston = 4 * 20
Charleston = 80

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
Toulouse = 2 * Charleston
Toulouse = 2 * 80
Toulouse = 160

Now, we add up the number of sheep in all three cities:
Total sheep = Seattle + Charleston + Toulouse
Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160
Total sheep = 260

Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 260 sheep together."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

6. **Add the total time for the download:**
   - Total time = 60 minutes (first 80 GB) + 20 minutes (update) + 60 minutes (remaining 120 GB) = 140 minutes

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 140 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - He then drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives the remaining time of 4 hours - 2 hours (standstill) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours at 80 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Distance covered in standstill traffic = 0 miles.
   - Distance covered at 30 mph = 15 miles.
   - Distance covered at 80 mph = 120 miles.
   - Total distance covered on the return trip = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John was initially 180 miles away from home.
   - He covered 135 miles on his return trip.
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance covered = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

So, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the appropriate rates.

1. Regular hours: 40 hours at $10 per hour.
2. Overtime hours: 45 total hours - 40 regular hours = 5 overtime hours at 1.2 times the regular rate.

First, calculate the regular earnings:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, calculate the overtime rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Then, calculate the overtime earnings:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, add the regular and overtime earnings to get the total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%, so the downloads were 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. Cost of donuts:
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
   - Cost of donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204

2. Cost of mini cupcakes:
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
   - Cost of mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160

3. Cost of mini cheesecakes:
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
   - Cost of mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330

Now, we add up the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Growth**: 7 lemons per year
3. **Selling Price per Lemon**: $1.5
4. **Annual Cost to Water and Feed**: $3

First, calculate the net profit per year:

- Revenue from selling lemons: \(7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}\)
- Cost to water and feed the tree: \$3/year
- Net profit per year: \(\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5\)

Now, we need to find the number of years (\(n\)) it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of planting the tree:

\[ \text{Net profit per year} \times n = \text{Initial cost} \]
\[ \$7.5 \times n = \$90 \]

Solving for \(n\):

\[ n = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**Final Answer: 12 years**"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after these sales. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

5. To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]

6. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]

7. Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]

8. Finally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance:
   - 20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

2. Next, we find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:
   - 20 - 4 = 16 students

3. Then, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:
   - 25% of 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

4. Now, we find out how many students are left for hip-hop dance:
   - 16 - 4 = 12 students

5. Finally, we calculate the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance:
   - (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 + ($5,000 * 2.5%) = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

2. **Electronic gadgets:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 + ($8,000 * 1.2%) = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Now, we compare the final values:
- Jewelry: $5,125
- Electronic gadgets: $8,096

The merchant would maximize profit by purchasing the electronic gadgets, as the final value is higher.

**Final profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96**

Therefore, the profit from the electronic gadgets purchase is $96."
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her weekly earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs, and then multiply that by the number of weeks she works in a year.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from teaching:
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.

Weekly earnings from teaching = $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from coaching:
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.

Weekly earnings from coaching = $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Now, let's add her weekly earnings from both jobs to get her total weekly earnings:
Total weekly earnings = $700/week (teaching) + $450/week (coaching) = $1150/week

Finally, to find her annual salary, we multiply her total weekly earnings by the number of weeks she works in a year:
Annual salary = $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year

Her annual salary is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire eats 3 eggs every day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: In 4 weeks, she eats:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert 84 eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
2. Determine the remaining distance she needs to cover.
3. Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance.

First, let's find the total time Marissa has to complete the hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour. The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. Using the formula for average speed:

\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} \]

We can rearrange this to find the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and another hour on the next 2 miles, which totals 2 hours. Therefore, she has:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

left to cover the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:

\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula for speed:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately, then account for the spill, and finally sum the remaining water.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters ≈ 6.67 liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = 9 liters.

3. **Account for the spill:**
   - We spill 1 liter of the orange drink.
   - The remaining orange drink is 9 liters.
   - The remaining water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \) liters = 6 liters.

4. **Calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters:**
   - Total water = Water from the remaining orange drink + Water from the pineapple drink
   - Total water = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount. This means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value:
\[ P = 26.00 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
3. The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of these items:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the amount spent on pizza is:
$50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can find the number of boxes by dividing the total cost of pizza by the cost per box:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

2. Cost of pants: 3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50
3. Cost of shoes: 3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.00

Now, we add up the costs:

Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00
Total cost = $243.00

Mishka spent $243.00 on all the clothing items."
"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings, so to find out how many cartons she will need, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

After 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream."
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two points on his trip.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip, which means it was at mile 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

The distance between his first and second stops is the difference between these two mile markers:

45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( B - 5 \).

We are also given that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. Therefore, the cost of the second pair of heels is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

Since the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is also equal to \( B - 5 \), we can set up the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the boots cost \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. So, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

Dividing both sides by 18, we find:

\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x\) back into the expression for Allen's age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Final numerical answer:

"The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first one's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than that is 60.

The third friend guesses 25% more than the first one's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

To find the average guess, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses:

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily hours spent on each dog.
2. Multiply the daily hours by the number of dogs.
3. Multiply the result by the number of days in a week.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs. So, the daily hours spent on all dogs is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly hours spent are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"

3. Aaron has 5 more than this amount:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   So, Aaron has 25 jewels.
4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from Aaron's jewels:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

Total points = 4 points + 5 points = 9 points

Final numerical answer:

"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets.
   - John has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.
   - Total money from selling lego sets = 13 * $15 = $195.

2. Next, calculate the total cost of the video games.
   - John buys 8 video games at $20 each.
   - Total cost of video games = 8 * $20 = $160.

3. Now, determine how much money John has after buying the video games.
   - John has $5 left after buying the video games.
   - Money spent on video games + Money left = Total money from selling lego sets.
   - $160 + $5 = $195.

4. Since the total money from selling the lego sets matches the amount spent on video games plus the money left, we can confirm the calculations are correct.

5. Finally, we need to determine how many lego sets John still has. Since he sold all his lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is 0.

Final numerical answer:
0"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. On the first day, John runs 3 hours.
2. On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, so he runs 1.5 hours each of those days.

Now, let's calculate the total time he runs in a week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

John runs a total of 60 miles in 6 hours. To find his average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour."
"Given that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and that her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can determine her running speed. If her skipping speed is half her running speed, then her running speed is:

\[ \text{Running speed} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed:

\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we know the time allocation for running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period. So, the time spent running is:

\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

And the time spent walking is:

\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she travels while running and walking. The distance traveled while running is:

\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The distance traveled while walking is:

\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance traveled in six hours:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"If Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone, then when holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. 

So, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. Therefore, the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can stand and still hit the dragon is:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pie pieces available initially is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content per gram of chips:**
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the 300g bag is \(5 \times 250 = 1250\) calories.
   - The calorie content per gram is \( \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \).

2. **Determine the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume is \(2000 - 1800 = 200\) calories.

3. **Calculate the grams of chips you can eat:**
   - Since each gram of chips contains approximately 4.17 calories, the grams of chips you can eat is \( \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.17 \text{ calories/gram}} \approx 48 \text{ grams} \).

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Determine the number of pounds of beeswax needed.
Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the supplies.
The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
\[ 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \]

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work: 220.
3. Add the number of Post-it notes remaining after her work: 23.
4. The result will be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased.

Let's do the math:

Initial Post-it notes: 80
Post-it notes used at work: 220
Post-it notes remaining: 23

So, the equation to find the number of Post-it notes in the package is:

\[ 80 - 220 + 23 = \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} \]

\[ -140 + 23 = -117 \]

Since the number of Post-it notes can't be negative, we need to correct the order of operations. The correct equation is:

\[ 80 + \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} - 220 = 23 \]

Let's solve for the number of Post-it notes in the package:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 220 - 80 + 23 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 140 + 23 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties he bought is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent on ties} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from a 4-foot piece of wire, we need to convert the length of the wire into inches and then divide by the length of each piece.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 4 feet = 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece:

48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor has 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

"To calculate how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
- Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
- Number of dozens per day = 252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozen per day.

Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
- Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen.
- Daily earnings = 21 dozen per day * $2 per dozen = $42 per day.

Step 3: Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs.

- Weekly earnings = $42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week.

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Without this information, we cannot determine the exact time it takes for Tom to travel back.

If we assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles, then:

1. The time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours, and the speed is 10 miles per hour. So, the distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

2. On the return trip, the speed is 6 miles per hour. The time taken to travel back can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books that Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. If 7.5 pounds of that weight is from the comic books, then the remaining weight that needs to be removed by the toys is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys that need to be removed to account for the remaining 7.5 pounds is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"

- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Truck tires: 0 tires * $60/tire = $0
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40/tire = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $0 + $480 = $480

**Difference in revenue:**
- Thursday's revenue - Friday's revenue = $520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday compared to Friday."
"The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have just had kittens. Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has 3 * 7 = 21 kittens. Trixie has had 12 kittens.

To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we add the adopted kittens, Patchy's kittens, and Trixie's kittens together:

7 (adopted kittens) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40 kittens.

The final numerical answer is:

"After 20 years of service, Marcy becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year. The base annual pension is $50,000. 

For the first 20 years, she receives the base pension of $50,000 per year. After 20 years, she gets an additional 5% of $50,000, which is:

\[ 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

So, after 20 years, her annual pension will be the base amount plus the additional 5%, which is:

\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the increased pension amount for the remaining 10 years. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years of service will be:

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year.

1. For the first half of the year, she pays $140 per month for 6 months.
2. For the second half of the year, she pays 10% less than $140 per month for 6 months.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first half of the year:
\[ \text{Cost for the first half} = 140 \times 6 \]

Next, we calculate the reduced monthly cost for the second half of the year:
\[ \text{Reduced monthly cost} = 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \]

Then, we calculate the cost for the second half of the year:
\[ \text{Cost for the second half} = 126 \times 6 \]

Finally, we add the costs of both halves to get the total amount paid for the year:
\[ \text{Total cost} = (140 \times 6) + (126 \times 6) \]

Now, let's do the math:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) and then use that to find out the total distance she can travel with a full tank.

First, we calculate the car's fuel efficiency:
- Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas.
- Therefore, the car's fuel efficiency is \( \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \).

Next, we use the fuel efficiency to find out how far she can drive on a full tank:
- The tank holds 12 gallons of gas.
- At 25 miles per gallon, the total distance she can drive on a full tank is \( 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total allowance she receives is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. This total is the sum of the money she started with and the allowance she received. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

- She teaches 5 classes every weekday (Monday to Friday), so that's \(5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}\).
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33 \text{ classes}\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, the total number of students is \(33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}\).

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money she makes:

- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, the total amount of money is \(495 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$7425.00\).

Therefore, Judy makes \(\$7425.00\) in one week."
"The first recipe has 20 instructions.

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has:
20 instructions * 2 = 40 instructions.

To prepare both dishes, Kelian has to read:
20 instructions + 40 instructions = 60 instructions.

Final numerical answer:

"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its price and then add the totals together.

For brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 per slice.
- Total from brownies = 43 slices * $3/slice = $129

For cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 per slice.
- Total from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92

Now, we add the totals from both items:
- Total money raised = $129 (from brownies) + $92 (from cheesecakes) = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for the 3-month period.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the final amount.
4. Divide the final amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Total cost of the cell phones before interest:**
   Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 5 \times 150 = 750
   \]

2. **Total interest for the 3-month period:**
   A 2% interest is charged on each unit. Since there are 5 units, the total interest is:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 5 \times 150 \times 0.02 = 750 \times 0.02 = 15
   \]

3. **Final amount to be paid:**
   Add the total interest to the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Final amount} = 750 + 15 = 765
   \]

4. **Monthly payment:**
   Divide the final amount by 3 to find the monthly payment:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{765}{3} = 255
   \]

So, Shiela will pay \(\boxed{255}\) each month for 3 months."
"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Now, let's calculate the total sales for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, let's add up the total sales:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. Level 3: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. Bottom level (Level 4): \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Now, we can find the average square footage of a level by summing the square footage of all levels and dividing by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Average square footage} = \frac{16 + 8 + 4 + 2}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]

The average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year, the first year will have 365 - 180 = 185 days remaining after the first 180 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy will consume:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy will consume:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

So, in the first year, the puppy will consume a total of:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year is:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the two different package options and then find the difference in cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:

1. Determine how many packages of 3 flowers are needed for 18 flowers:
   \[
   \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ packages}
   \]
2. Calculate the total cost for 6 packages:
   \[
   6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:

1. Determine how many packages of 2 flowers are needed for 18 flowers:
   \[
   \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ packages}
   \]
2. Calculate the total cost for 9 packages:
   \[
   9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options to determine the savings:

\[
15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6.00}\) dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30% of $100.

30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

So, the discount amount is $30.

Subtract the discount from the original cost:

$100 - $30 = $70

The final cost of the grooming is $70."
"Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, so:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, they together got:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water given to the girls and the boy is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters, so the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Charlie starts with 10 stickers.
2. He buys 21 more stickers, so now he has \(10 + 21 = 31\) stickers.
3. He receives 23 more stickers for his birthday, so now he has \(31 + 23 = 54\) stickers.
4. Charlie gives 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has \(54 - 9 = 45\) stickers.
5. He uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has \(45 - 28 = 17\) stickers.

Therefore, the final number of stickers Charlie has left is 17."
"Grace weighs 125 pounds.

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, so we calculate Alex's weight as follows:

4 times Grace's weight: \(4 \times 125 = 500\) pounds
Alex's weight: \(500 - 2 = 498\) pounds

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's and Alex's weights together:

\(125 + 498 = 623\) pounds

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."
"To find the total number of thorns, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses.
2. Calculate the total number of thorns based on the number of roses.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses.
Dan plants 3 rose bushes, and each rose bush has 25 roses.
So, the total number of roses is \(3 \times 25 = 75\).

Step 2: Calculate the total number of thorns.
Each rose has 8 thorns.
So, the total number of thorns is \(75 \times 8 = 600\).

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games the team lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won can be represented as \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is 22, so we can write the equation:

\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost:

\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

The team won 15 games.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which means it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.
3. The third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, which means it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, to find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of times it rang each time:

4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. The company increases the salary by 10% every year for those who've stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just clocked 5 years in the company, she will start receiving the increased salary from the next year, which is her 6th year of service.

Let's calculate her salary after each year for the next three years.

**Year 6:**
- Initial salary: $600
- Increase: 10% of $600 = $60
- New salary: $600 + $60 = $660

**Year 7:**
- Initial salary: $660
- Increase: 10% of $660 = $66
- New salary: $660 + $66 = $726

**Year 8:**
- Initial salary: $726
- Increase: 10% of $726 = $72.60
- New salary: $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

So, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will be $798.60."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is:

Christina will spend $18."
"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of potato salad one child will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the adults.
3. Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the children.
4. Add the amounts from steps 2 and 3 to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

Step 1: One child will eat half as much as an adult. Since an adult eats 10 lbs, a child will eat:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \]

Step 2: There are 20 adults, and each will eat 10 lbs, so the total for the adults is:
\[ 20 \times 10 \text{ lbs} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Step 3: There are 5 children, and each will eat 5 lbs, so the total for the children is:
\[ 5 \times 5 \text{ lbs} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Step 4: Add the amounts from steps 2 and 3 to get the total amount of potato salad needed:
\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"Let's denote the time Gerald used to take to run the 400-meter hurdles as \( G \) seconds. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, so Lee's time was \( G - 2 \) seconds.

We are given that Lee now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ G - 2 = 38 \]

Solving for \( G \):
\[ G = 38 + 2 \]
\[ G = 40 \]

So, Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds. With his improved diet, Gerald's speed increased by 10%. To find his new time, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds and subtract it from 40 seconds:
\[ \text{New time} = 40 - (0.10 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{New time} = 40 - 4 \]
\[ \text{New time} = 36 \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:

Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's find out how many boys there are:

Total students = 200
Fraction of boys = 2/5

Number of boys = 200 * (2/5) = 80

Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout:

Fraction of girls in the girl scout = 2/3

Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 * (2/3) = 80

Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout:

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

So, the final numerical answer is:

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce. So, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. We do this by dividing the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit and did not have to drive through the traffic jam.

The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be expressed as the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, minus the 5 cars that took an exit.

The equation representing this situation is:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 25 \]

Further simplifying:
\[ x + 15 = 25 \]

Subtracting 15 from both sides:
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 10 \).

Yesterday, she received 18 more potted plants, so her total number of potted plants becomes:

\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \text{ potted plants} \]

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 40 \times 1 = 40 \text{ potted plants} \]

Subtracting the 40 potted plants she will give away from her total, she will remain with:

\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \text{ potted plants} \]

Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."
"The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means the second friend pressed it 20 * (1/4) = 5 more times than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed it 60 + 10 = 70 times.

To find the total number of doorbell rings, we add the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:

20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

The doorbell made a total of 175 rings."

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box and then calculate its volume. After that, we can multiply by 3 to get the total volume for all 3 boxes.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions will be reduced by 2 inches in each direction (1 inch from each side).

So, the inner dimensions of one box will be:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups they ate on average, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate.

For Beatrice, the roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. So, the total number of fruit roll-ups she ate is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

For Marcell, the roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, the total number of fruit roll-ups he ate is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Now, we add the number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both Beatrice and Marcell to get the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people, which is 2:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is:
45"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we find out how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore. We know that it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore and that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. We can calculate the total distance she rows by setting up a proportion:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{20 \text{ feet} \times 64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

So, Julia rows 80 feet to reach the shore.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of water that enters the boat. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can set up a proportion to find out how much water is taken on for 80 feet:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{y \text{ liters}}{80 \text{ feet}}
\]

Solving for \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{2 \text{ liters} \times 80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

So, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

\[
\boxed{16}

"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
2. Each lesson uses the whiteboard.
3. The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

First, we calculate the number of lessons in a day for all teachers combined:
- There are 4 teachers.
- Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
- Therefore, the total number of lessons in a day is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Next, we calculate the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day:
- The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.
- There are 8 lessons in a day.
- Therefore, the total number of cleanings in a day is \(8 \times 3 = 24\).

So, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). Therefore, we have the equation: \( 300 = 50D \).
4. Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6."
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought:

- Sasha bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]

- Sasha also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]

- The total cost of the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

- Sasha is selling the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Since the price has increased by 50%, the new price is:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15 \text{ per board}
  \]
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]

- Sasha is also selling the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards. The new price is:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24 \text{ per board}
  \]
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]

- The total revenue from selling the lumber is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90
\]

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{90}\)."
"The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the mixture are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water combined. Since the total parts are 20, each part is equal to 120 / 20 = 6 teaspoons.

Since the sugar makes up 7 parts of the mixture, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons.

"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

1. First, find the total number of pairs of shoes: \(2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs}\).
2. Then, calculate the total cost: \(6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360\).

Therefore, John paid $360."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles (total on the second day) - 10 vehicles (from the first day) = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.

4 containers"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. So, his new salary is:
   \[ 40,000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \]

3. Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary four years ago was \( L \), then:
   \[ 40,000 = L \times (1 + 0.30) = L \times 1.30 \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \]

4. Four years later, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, her new salary is:
   \[ 30,769.23 \times (1 + 0.40) = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.94 \]

5. The total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[ 56,000 + 43,076.94 = 99,076.94 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.94."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper. 

So, in a week, he uses:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits they have:

Morisette's fruits: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael's fruits: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

Total fruits: 13 + 14 = 27 fruits

They have a total of 27 fruits."
"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so she slept:
8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

Over the two days, she slept:
6 + 6 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept:
6 + 1 = 7 hours each of those days.

There are 3 days left in the week (Tuesday, Wednesday, and the rest of the week), so she slept:
7 + 7 + 7 = 21 hours for the rest of the week.

Adding all the hours together:
8 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 21 (the rest of the week) = 41 hours.

So, Sadie slept a total of 41 hours throughout the week."
"Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, which means she covers:

\[ 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the initial 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. Since the total time is 7 hours, the remaining time is:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

At 5 miles per hour for 4 hours, she covers:

\[ 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the two distances together, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

\[ 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (the package she bought plus the package her husband bought).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \)
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \)

We also know the total number of bees in the hive is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting the relationships into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ \frac{4B}{2} + \frac{2B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]
\[ \frac{7B}{2} = 700 \]

Solving for B:
\[ 7B = 1400 \]
\[ B = 200 \]

"First, let's identify the food and non-food items:

- Milk is a food item, so its cost is $2.
- Eggs are a food item, so its cost is $3.
- Light bulbs are non-food items, so its cost is $3.
- Cups are non-food items, so its cost is $3.
- Roach traps are non-food items, so its cost is $4.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the non-food items before tax:

$3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $10

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:

10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the non-food items:

$10 (non-food items) + $1 (tax) = $11

Now, let's add the cost of the food items:

$2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) = $5

Finally, we add the cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:

$5 (food items) + $11 (non-food items with tax) = $16

"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- He already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we need to calculate the total expenses for the bleach and cloths:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach, and each bottle costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost of bleach per client is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- Each client also needs 1 pack of cloths, and each pack costs $5.
- Therefore, the cost of cloths per client is $5.

So, the total cost per client is \(4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we can calculate the total expenses for all 8 clients:

- The total cost for all clients is \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Kim's total income each week is $92.

Finally, we can calculate the profit:

- Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses.
- Therefore, the profit is \(92 - 72 = 20\) dollars.

So, the profit Kim will make each week is $20."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Step 1: There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: John can harvest every 3 months, so in a year (which has 12 months), he can harvest:
12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year.

Step 3: Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year:
100 pineapples/hectare * 4 harvests/year = 400 pineapples/hectare/year.

Since John has 10 hectares, we multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of hectares:
400 pineapples/hectare/year * 10 hectares = 4000 pineapples/year.

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and the next 6 hours (30 + 60 = 90 bees) return to the hive.

So, in the last 6 hours, 90 bees return to the hive.

The final numerical answer is:
90"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. So, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$12 = \$22 \]

If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, it means she gave more than the total cost of the tickets. To find out how much she gave, we add the change to the total cost:

\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change} = \$22 + \$8 = \$30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up some equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so Charlie has \( 3D \) friends.
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so James has \( 4D \) friends.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so we can write the equation \( 3D = 12 \).

Now, we can solve for \( D \):
\[ 3D = 12 \]
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends, we can find out how many friends James has:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

Final numerical answer:
16"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes
- Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

The difference in time between the winner (Steve) and the loser (Tim) is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

4 minutes"
"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to determine the total number of tires inflated and then multiply by the cost per tire.

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles mean 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles mean 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle means 1 * 1 = 1 tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents.

Converting cents to dollars, we get 500 cents / 100 = $5.00.

So, Shawnda made $5.00 that day."
"To find out how much change Carl receives, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys.
2. Calculate the total cost of the cookies.
3. Subtract the total cost from the amount Carl paid to find the change.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies.
Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack contains 6 cookies.
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cookies.
Each cookie costs $0.10.
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the change.
Carl pays with a $10 bill.
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

So, the change Carl receives is:
\[ \$4.00 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

1. Let the initial number of fries be \( x \).

2. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).

3. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

5. A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( x - 30 \), which is \( \frac{x - 30}{3} \).

6. Ants carried off the final fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the remaining fries are \( \frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

Now, we can set up the equation and solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5
\]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[
x - 30 = 18
\]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[
x = 48
\]

So, the initial number of fries in the pack was 48.

\[
\boxed{48}

"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours he spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
- So, for each of these 3 days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.

Since he has these classes on 3 days a week, the total for these days is:
\[3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

Next, let's calculate the number of hours he spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
- So, for each of these 2 days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.

Since he has these classes on 2 days a week, the total for these days is:
\[4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week}\]

Now, let's add the hours from both parts of the week to get the total weekly hours:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\]

Finally, to find the total number of hours he spends attending classes in one semester (16 weeks), we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks:
\[17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\]

So, Kimo spends a total of 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we need to calculate the length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum them up.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Number of rolls: 300
   - Length of each roll: 4 inches
   - Total length of rolls: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Number of croissants: 120
   - Length of each croissant: 6 inches
   - Total length of croissants: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Number of baguettes: 60
   - Length of each baguette: 2 feet (which is 24 inches)
   - Total length of baguettes: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches

Now, we sum up the total lengths in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[3360 \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to first determine the monthly consumption of bananas by all the apes and then multiply that by 2.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Total bananas needed per month = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas

For 2 months, the total bananas needed = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- The football field is 100 yards long.
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Each round trip is \(100 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 200 \text{ yards}\).
- Total distance for Blake: \(200 \text{ yards} \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards}\).

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- The distance to the 40-yard line and back is \(40 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 80 \text{ yards}\).
- Total distance for Kelly: \(80 \text{ yards} \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards}\).

Now, we find the difference in the distances they run:
- Distance run by Blake: 3000 yards
- Distance run by Kelly: 2720 yards
- Difference: \(3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards}\).

The winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."

Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"Finn initially watches 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them come out from under a lily pad, and 2 of them hide under a rock. 

So, the number of tadpoles he can see now is the initial number minus the ones that hid plus the ones that came out:

11 (initial) - 2 (hid under a rock) + 6 (came out from under a lily pad) = 15 tadpoles.

Finn can now see 15 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth is:
17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet

- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught:

Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

36 / 2 = 18

So, the price will increase 18 times.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. Each time the price increases, it increases by 20% of the original price. We can represent the new price after each increase as:

New Price = Original Price * (1 + Increase Rate)

Where the increase rate is 20%, or 0.20. So, the new price after each increase is:

New Price = $20 * (1 + 0.20) = $20 * 1.20

Now, we need to apply this increase 18 times. The price after 18 increases can be calculated as:

Final Price = Original Price * (1 + Increase Rate)^Number of Increases

Final Price = $20 * (1.20)^18

Now, let's calculate (1.20)^18:

(1.20)^18 ≈ 39.366

So, the final price is:

Final Price = $20 * 39.366 ≈ $787.32

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months would be approximately $787.32."
"Given:

- 1 doll

The cost of one red car is $4.
The cost of one action figure is $5.
The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, let's calculate the cost of the doll:
Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- The total cost of the red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]
- The total cost of the action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]
- The cost of the doll is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together, the total cost of all the toys is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. The accountant charges $90.
2. If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work at $35 per hour.

First, calculate the lost income:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Now, compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income:
\[ \text{Lost income} - \text{Accountant's fee} = \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, Jackie will have \$15 more if she hires the accountant.

The cost of the screen is €157.
The cost of the keyboard and mouse is €74.
The cost of the CD burner is €74.
The cost of the printer is €102.

First, we add up the costs of all the items:

\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 74 + 102 = 1497 \]

Elvira's budget is €1500. So, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B \]
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old."
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is 2 * $8 = $16. Adding $2 to that amount gives us $16 + $2 = $18.

"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. The hat costs $25.
2. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the costs to find the total cost of each uniform:

- Hat: $25
- Jacket: $75
- Pants: $50

Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50 = $150

Each uniform costs a total of $150."

"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, it will take \( 60 \times 1.5 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, it will take \( 60 \times 5 \) seconds.

Now, let's convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- \( 60 \times 5 \) seconds is equal to \( 300 \) seconds.
- Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, \( 300 \) seconds is equal to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) minutes.

Now, let's add the time for peeling and cutting:

First, we need to find out how old Mark was two years ago. Since Jan is currently 30, two years ago Jan was 28. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 14. According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than 14, which means Mark was 19 two years ago.

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
\[ 19 + 2 = 21 \]

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we add 2 years to Mark's current age to find Jean's age:
\[ 21 + 2 = 23 \]

So, Jean is 23 years old.

Jean is 23."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's time is 222 seconds.
The difference in time = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then expressing that difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[ \frac{0.25}{0.25} \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rats are in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
2. The hamsters are in 10 cages, each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
3. The rabbits get a total of 20 pieces of straw.
4. The total amount of straw distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160 pieces.

First, we need to find out how much straw was given to the hamsters. Since there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, the total amount of straw given to the hamsters is:

\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

Now, we know that the total straw distributed among the small rodents is 160 pieces, and 50 of those pieces were given to the hamsters. Therefore, the amount of straw given to the rats is:

\[ 160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} = 110 \text{ pieces} \]

Since the rats are in 3 cages and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total straw given to the rats by the number of pieces each rat gets:

\[ \frac{110 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = \frac{110}{6} = \frac{55}{3} \approx 18.33 \]

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, and we know the rats are in 3 cages in equal groups, we can conclude that the number of rats in each cage is:

\[ \frac{55}{3} \div 3 = \frac{55}{9} \approx 6 \]

However, since the number of rats must be a whole number and the division should be exact, we can conclude that the number of rats in each cage is:

\[ \frac{55}{3} = 18 \text{ (with a remainder, but since we are distributing equally, it must be a whole number)} \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to apply the monthly interest rate of 2% to the initial amount of $100 for each of the 3 months.

Let's break it down month by month:

**Month 1:**
- Initial amount: $100
- Interest for the month: $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total amount after 1 month: $100 + $2 = $102

**Month 2:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $102
- Interest for the month: $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total amount after 2 months: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**Month 3:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $104.04
- Interest for the month: $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total amount after 3 months: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12.

Final numerical answer:
$106.12"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought as \( x \).

The cost to buy each bag is $20, and the cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars.

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is then \( 30 - 22 = 8 \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as \( 8x = 400 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 8x = 400 \]
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he collects peaches for a total of 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock.
2. Divide the weekly requirement by 7 to find the daily requirement.

Step 1: Calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock.
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are 10 ducks in the flock.
Total weekly requirement = 3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Step 2: Divide the weekly requirement by 7 to find the daily requirement.
Daily requirement = 35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net increase in trees per year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.

2. Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.

3. Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the number of trees before any die is \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

4. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, 70% of the trees survive. The number of trees that survive is \(130 \times 0.70 = 91\) trees.

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left is 91."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Friday morning, there are 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard.
2. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \) flamingos. These 6 flamingos were then painted white and put back out.
3. So, on Saturday morning, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) and the number of white flamingos is 6.
4. On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. So, the number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \) and the number of white flamingos remains 6.

At noon on Sunday, the number of pink flamingos is 30 and the number of white flamingos is 6. The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."

"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants.
2. Subtract the distributed amount from the total amount of carrots available.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of carrots distributed.
Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants.
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 2: Subtract the distributed amount from the total amount of carrots available.
There are 200 pounds of carrots available.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40
- Cards after the third month: 200

Total cards = Initial cards + Cards after the first month + Cards after the second month + Cards after the third month
Total cards = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200
Total cards = 320

So, Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards now in total."
"Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, he earns:
5 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays him 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, he earns:
10 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers, Mark makes:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese for sandwiches: \(7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate an omelet 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese for omelets: \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**

"To get an average of 93 over six tests, Brinley needs to have a total of \(93 \times 6 = 558\) points across all six tests, because the average is the total sum of scores divided by the number of tests.

Brinley's current total from the first five tests is \(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438\).

To find out what she needs on the sixth test, we subtract her current total from the required total:

\(558 - 438 = 120\).

However, since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average, Brinley should aim to remove the lowest score from her first five tests before adding the sixth test score. The lowest score among her first five tests is 71.

So, if Brinley removes 71 from her total, her new total becomes \(438 - 71 = 367\).

To get an average of 93, she needs a total of 558 points. Therefore, the score she needs on the sixth test is:

\(558 - 367 = 191\).

Brinley needs to score 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93, after removing her lowest score of 71."
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did is:
\[ 860 \text{ km} \]"
"Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 20g.

Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find the cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates (which is 6 plates) would cost:
   \[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

2. The problem states that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
   \[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

3. Twenty dozen cups is equal to \(20 \times 12 = 240\) cups. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of the 240 cups by 240:
   \[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then figure out how much more money she needs to earn.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items:
   - The jacket costs $30.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

2. Calculate how much money Sara has already earned and saved:
   - Sara has $10 saved before she starts babysitting.
   - She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is $10 + $20 = $30.

3. Determine how much more money Sara needs to earn:
   - The total cost of the items is $70.
   - Sara has $30 saved and earned.
   - Therefore, the additional amount of money Sara needs is $70 - $30 = $40.

4. Calculate how many times Sara must mow the lawn to earn the additional $40:
   - Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.
   - Therefore, the number of times she must mow the lawn is $40 / $4 = 10.

So, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, which is a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance he walks by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers by the third day.

So, the number of customers on the third day is 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250.

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she promised to return, which is the borrowed amount plus 10% of the borrowed amount.

1. Calculate 10% of $2000:
\[ 10\% \times 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

2. Add this to the borrowed amount to find the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

3. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

4. Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned to find the remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Janeth's remaining balance by then will be $220."
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

In total, there are 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers in the vase."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, we calculate Yuri's points:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri scored 10 more than this: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Next, we calculate Brianna's points:
- Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

To find Jojo's points, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
- Total points: 251
- Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)

So, Jojo's points are:
- \( 251 - 197 = 54 \)

Jojo scored 54 points."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The tank initially has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water, so the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount of what was left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater collected:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"To travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, it takes Andrew 6 days. 

To travel from Rochester back to New Jersey by car, it takes half as many days as the bus trip, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

So, the total travel time for the round trip is the sum of the days for each leg of the journey:

\[ 6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Andrew will travel for a total of 9 days."
"First, let's calculate the new number of each type of card after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards:

30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 total cards

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.3333... \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:

\[ 33\% \]"
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's burrito, we need to add up the cost of each item he ordered and then subtract the value of the gift card.

1. Base burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces per minute.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
3. The number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
4. When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at that time is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
5. The number of watermelons remaining after harvesting the 63 ready ones is:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars**: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000
2. **Tax on the cars**: 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. **Registration fees**: $1,000 per car * 12 cars = $12,000

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total cost:

$240,000 (cost of cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration fees) = $276,000

Therefore, Mark pays a total of $276,000 for everything."
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, she collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, she collects 25 * 2 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday."
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then there were 50 / 2 = 25 bugs.

"There are 36 penguins sunbathing initially.

One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean:
36 / 3 = 12 penguins

Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner:
36 / 3 = 12 penguins

To find out how many are still left sunbathing, we subtract the penguins that left from the initial number:
36 - 12 - 12 = 12 penguins

Final numerical answer:
12 penguins are still left sunbathing."
"Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 cherry tomatoes per day.

Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 cherry tomatoes per day.

In a week, they eat 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 cherry tomatoes.

If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, then the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough cherry tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend.

21 vines"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
- There are 20 friends, and each friend wants 4 slices.
- Total slices needed = 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

Step 2: Determine how many pizzas are required.
- Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.
- Number of pizzas needed = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza = 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. He uses these 25 pens, which will leave him with 25 empty pens.
3. He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, with 25 empty pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new full pens.
4. After making these 5 new pens, he will have 5 empty pens left from the new pens and no empty pens from the original 25 pens, so he now has 5 empty pens.
5. He can again mix the ink from these 5 empty pens to make 1 more full pen.
6. After making this pen, he will have 1 empty pen left and no empty pens from the previous 5 pens, so he now has 1 empty pen.
7. He cannot make any more pens because he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen, and he only has 1 empty pen.

So, the total number of pens he has is the original 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made from the first mixing, plus the 1 new pen he made from the second mixing. This gives us:

\[ 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is 31."

"If Jessa is 20 years old, then Joan, who is five years older than Jessa, is:

20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is:

25 - 2 = 23 years old.

The sum of the ages of the three girls is:

20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68.

The final numerical answer is 68."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of the students went out through exit A. So, the number of students who went out through exit A is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. The number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A is:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. So, the number of students who went out through exit B is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

4. The number of students who went out through exit C is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B. So, the number of students who went out through exit C is:
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. So we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
\[ J = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:
\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has two books, and Pandora has one book. If both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider the total number of books read by both of them.

Dolly will read her two books plus Pandora's one book, which totals 3 books. Pandora will read her one book plus Dolly's two books, which also totals 3 books.

However, since the question asks for the total number of books collectively read, and each book is read by at least one person, we do not double count the books. Therefore, the total number of books read is the sum of the books each person has, which is 2 (Dolly's books) + 1 (Pandora's book) = 3 books.

Collectively, they will read 3 books by the end.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike originally had 5 pen pals but stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with 3 people.
2. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends 10 pages a week (2 letters * 5 pages).
3. Since Mike is pen pals with 3 people, the total number of pages he receives in a week is 30 pages (3 pen pals * 10 pages each).
4. Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week in response.
5. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is 60 pages (30 pages received + 30 pages written).
6. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. So, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes.
7. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 6 hours writing a week."
"Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. 

Every day, he uses 15 minutes for a call with his boss. Over 30 days, he uses:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

He also has 300 extra minutes of calls to other people.

So, the total minutes used this month is:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (extra calls) = 750 minutes

Subtracting the total minutes used from the monthly plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

Final answer: Griffin had 20 fries given by Ginger."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

1. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and it takes 6 hours each day.
   \[
   \text{Daily cost} = 250 \times 6 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.

So, Jean paid a total of $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

So, in total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. Each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so there are \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) boys and \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) girls in total.

Now, let's look at the girls in each class:
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.

So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is \(15 + 12 = 27\).

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is \(30 - 27 = 3\).

Since each class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is \(20 - 3 = 17\).

Therefore, Travis now has 70 apps on his tablet."
"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as \( C \). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3C \).

It is also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, \( C = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

Now, we can find the number of wolves killed today:
\[ 3C = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

So, today Rick killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars.

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the animals killed last night and today:
\[ 10 \text{ (wolves)} + 15 \text{ (cougars)} + 36 \text{ (wolves)} + 12 \text{ (cougars)} = 73 \]

"Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract that from 30:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]
So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the total number of cows before Mr. Sylas buys more. There are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we add the 2 new cows to each stall's original 20 cows:

\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows/stall} \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\[ 22 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 176 \]"

"Each 10-foot section of the redwood weighs 400 pounds. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, it has 20 sections (200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections).

The total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it would be:
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds.

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 30% of 8000 pounds is:
0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds.

The remaining weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% is:
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
5600 pounds."

Additionally, she has to pay a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. So, the total amount she has to pay is:

\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Therefore, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has \(48 / 2 = 24\) bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:

- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has \(52 + 24 = 76\) fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has \(44 + 48 = 92\) fruits.

The total number of fruits is \(76 + 92 = 168\).

Final numerical answer:
168"
"To make 36 cookies, which is three times the amount of a dozen (12 cookies), Carla will need 3 times the amount of flour. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, she will need:

\[ 2 \text{ cups} \times 3 = 6 \text{ cups} \]

For 30 cookies, which is 2.5 times the amount of a dozen, she will need 2.5 times the amount of flour:

\[ 2 \text{ cups} \times 2.5 = 5 \text{ cups} \]

Adding the flour needed for both days:

\[ 6 \text{ cups} + 5 \text{ cups} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate two thirds of the total number of pennies in the cup.
2. Convert the number of pennies to dollars, knowing that 100 pennies equal $1.

Let's start with step 1:

Two thirds of 9,300 pennies is calculated as:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200 \text{ pennies} \]

Now, for step 2:

To convert 6200 pennies to dollars, we divide by 100:
\[ \frac{6200}{100} = 62 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is:
\[ 62 \text{ dollars} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so Harry has \( 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \) trees.

Now, to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\( 11 - 3 = 8 \)

So, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard.

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. Calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times \$350,000 = 0.05 \times \$350,000 = \$17,500 \]

2. Calculate the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \times \$350,000 = 0.12 \times \$350,000 = \$42,000 \]

3. Calculate the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = \$350,000 + \$17,500 + \$42,000 = \$409,500 \]

4. Determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = \$409,500 - \$400,000 = \$9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. Calculate the transfer fees:
   Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000
   Transfer fees = $12,000

2. Calculate the brokerage fee:
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
   Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $400,000
   Brokerage fee = $20,000

3. Calculate the total fees:
   Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee
   Total fees = $12,000 + $20,000
   Total fees = $32,000

4. Calculate the net proceeds:
   Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Remaining loan amount
   Net proceeds = $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000
   Net proceeds = $118,000

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - So, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:** 
   - Time to heat to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
   - Time to heat to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
   - Time to cook: 23 minutes
   - Total time: \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes

"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.

So, the total cost for the newspaper ads is:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars/ad} \times 50 \text{ ads} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.

So, the total cost for the television ads is:
\[ 75 \text{ dollars/ad} \times 15 \text{ ads} = 1125 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the total costs for the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

First, we calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- So, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses is:
- \(2 \times 6 = 12\) windows.

Next, we calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
- There are 4 additional windows in each house.
- So, for 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
- \(2 \times 4 = 8\) windows.

Finally, we add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
- \(12 + 8 = 20\) windows.

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:

\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves. So, the number of stitches for the two sleeves combined is:

\[ 1800 \text{ (total stitches)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, and rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:

\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.

So, the total cost for the tomato seeds is:
20 packets * $40/packet = $800

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.

So, the total cost for the celery seeds is:
80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

Now, we add the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds to find the total amount of money used:
$800 (tomato seeds) + $2400 (celery seeds) = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The solo song has 54 lines.
2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines. Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.
3. The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

The total number of lines Sean has to memorize is:
\[54 + 36 + 48 = 138\]

"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40.

Final numerical answer:
40"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots on all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we find half of the combined total number of spots:

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. So, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
   \[
   8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length occupied by the topaz gemstones, we get the length occupied by the sterling silver beads:
   \[
   25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we divide the length occupied by the beads by the length of each bead:
   \[
   \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads}

There are two rows of 6 stars, so:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Now, let's add the stars from the 8-star and 6-star rows:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has a total of 76 stars, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of 5-star stars by 5:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag."

"After 3 rounds, the points are as follows:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which is 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So:
- Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points after the extra points are distributed are:
- Mike: 22 points

On the second day, he does:
- 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities he's done in the two days is:
220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eating rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily rice consumption for the household.
2. Determine the total weekly rice consumption.
3. Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total daily rice consumption for the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, each person consumes:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

For 5 members of the household, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total weekly rice consumption.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's add up the crates he sold from Tuesday to Thursday and the weekend:

- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates

Total crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and the weekend:
15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Now, we subtract this total from his target of 120 crates to find out how many crates he was off by:

120 - 65 = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. 

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. Each subsequent bid increases by $50.
3. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she makes 3 bids.

Let's calculate the bids:

- First bid (after the opening bid): $200 + $50 = $250
- Second bid: $250 + $50 = $300
- Third bid: $300 + $50 = $350

Now, we add up all the bids Carmen makes:

$250 (first bid) + $300 (second bid) + $350 (third bid) = $900

So, the desk costs Carmen $900."
"To calculate the total cost for the year, we need to break down the expenses into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Daily Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so he drives 60 miles each day.

2. **Weekly Miles Driven:**
   - He drives 60 miles each day and works 5 days a week, so he drives 60 * 5 = 300 miles per week.

3. **Annual Miles Driven:**
   - He drives 300 miles per week and works 50 weeks a year, so he drives 300 * 50 = 15,000 miles per year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - He is charged $2 per mile, so for 15,000 miles, the cost is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - He gives a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus for the year is 12 * $150 = $1,800.

6. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Adding the cost of miles driven and the annual bonus, the total cost for the year is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

**Final Answer:**
$31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes.
On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
16 minutes + 23 minutes = 39 minutes

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To create a 32-page tabloid, you would need 16 pieces of paper. 

Here's the reasoning: Each sheet of paper, when folded in half, can print 4 pages (2 on the front and 2 on the back). So, for a 32-page tabloid, you would need 32 / 4 = 8 sheets of paper. However, since each sheet of paper is folded in half to create two pages on the front and two on the back, you actually only need half the number of sheets as the total number of pages. Therefore, 32 pages would require 32 / 2 = 16 pieces of paper."
"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. She also spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \]

To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

So, the amount left is $15."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise started with 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total number of books sold is the sum of the books sold in the first, second, and third years, which is \(90 + \text{second year sales} + 45 = 200\).

From this, we can find the number of books sold in the second year:
\[90 + \text{second year sales} + 45 = 200\]
\[135 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 200 - 135\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 65\]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is $1300."
"Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works 50 hours a week. He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

50 hours * $10/hour = $500

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total weekly earnings including the bonus are:

$500 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800

April typically has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:

$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. 

To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

"The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, so:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

This means 40 loaves are sold in the morning, leaving:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening. Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we can set up a proportion based on the rate at which Sandy loses weight:

If 4 weeks = 2 pounds, then \( x \) weeks = 8 pounds.

So, \( x = \frac{8 \text{ pounds} \times 4 \text{ weeks}}{2 \text{ pounds}} \).

\( x = \frac{32}{2} \).

\( x = 16 \) weeks.

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

16 weeks."
"To calculate the savings, let's first determine the discount on each item and then apply it to the quantities you're buying.

1. The discount on a tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.
2. The discount on a packet of milk is $0.5.

Now, let's calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:

- For 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $2 = $4
- For 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2

Total savings = $4 + $2 = $6

You will save $6 if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk."
"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the person will grow an extra arm and an extra leg within that period.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   - Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 * $100 + $700 = $500 + $700 = $1200

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000.

Now, let's add up all the expenses and the amount he wants to save to find out how much he has in total:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) + $2000 (savings) = $3950

The total amount Theo has is $6000, so the amount he has left to spend on gifts is:
$6000 - $3950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many eggs are consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day. 
   - Each of these three people eats 3 eggs per day.
   - So, the total for these three people per day is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.

2. Next, we need to determine how many eggs are consumed by the remaining two people who eat two eggs each day.
   - Each of these two people eats 2 eggs per day.
   - So, the total for these two people per day is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

3. Now, we add the eggs consumed by both groups to find the total number of eggs consumed by the family per day.
   - The total per day is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

4. To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).
   - The total for a week is \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

30 - 3 = 27 years old.

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, Trent's age is:

27 + 5 = 32 years old.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.
4. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, which means the population was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

Now, we need to find the current population of Chile. The problem states that the population six years ago was half of what it is now. Therefore, the current population is twice the population six years ago.

So, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Final numerical answer:
120000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

There are also half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of that number (8) had previous commitments:

- \(1/4 \times 8 = 2\) people had previous commitments.

Now, we subtract the people who couldn't come and those with previous commitments from the total number of people invited:

- Total people who couldn't come: \(8 + 2 = 10\)

So, the number of people who show up is:

- \(24 - 10 = 14\)

"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the volume \( V \) is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. Therefore, if there are 45 electric wires, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles. Then we have:

\[
\frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}

"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 is 10 people.

This means that 30 people stayed at the party (40 - 10 = 30).

We are told that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were originally 25 men, the number of men who left is 3 (25 - 22 = 3).

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 must have been women (10 - 3 = 7).

Therefore, the number of women who left is 7.

Originally, there were 15 women, so the number of women left at the party is 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to determine the total number of pencils they have together.

Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up the equation for Jam's pencils as follows:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Let's solve for the number of pencils per box:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]
\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we know that Jam has 26 pencils in total, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils they have together is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils if each box can hold 8 pencils. We can calculate this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the number of ice cubes added and then use that to find the total weakening effect from the ice cubes and the cream.

First, we find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we divide 65 by 13:

\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \]

So, Shannon adds 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so the total weakening effect from the ice cubes is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. The cream also weakens the coffee, so we add this to the weakening effect from the ice cubes:

\[ 60 + 15 = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the given scenario.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

Since each new record requires 2 old records, for 7 new records, the total number of old records given up is:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Since the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, and we know there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[ 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Thus, the total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that after the second bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points as follows:

40 percentage points * 3 minutes per percentage point = 120 minutes

To convert 120 minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

$80 / $20 = 4

So, they earned $4 in rewards for their next purchase.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their $4 reward. However, they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the reward is $4, the coupon took:

2 * $4 = $8 off the price.

So, the total amount after applying the reward and the coupon is:

$43 - $4 (reward) - $8 (coupon) = $31

Therefore, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly rate: $15

- Total annual pay before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of ruined castles.
2. Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles.

Step 1: Calculate the number of ruined castles.
40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins. So, we calculate 40% of 220:
\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]
So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Step 2: Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles.
Half of the ruined castles are unmanned. So, we calculate half of 88:
\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]
So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles.

Final numerical answer:
44"
"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost of each offer and then subtract one from the other.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we find the difference between the two total costs:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to calculate the total number of guns they have combined.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, Richard (RJ) has 1 gun, and Richard (Richard) has 5 guns. 

So, the total number of guns is:
8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns

There are 4 people (DJ, Nick, Richard, and Jason), so we divide the total number of guns by 4 to find out how many each would have if shared equally:

24 guns ÷ 4 people = 6 guns per person

Each of them would have 6 guns."
"To calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can multiply the amount of sugar required for each batch by the number of batches and then add the totals together.

For suckers:
30 ounces/batch × 8 batches = 240 ounces

For fudge:
70 ounces/batch × 1 batch = 70 ounces

Now, we add the two amounts together:
240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces

Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"To find the final value of all Maria's shares, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial total cost of the shares.
2. Calculate the value of the shares after the first year.
3. Calculate the value of the shares after the second year.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial total cost of the shares.**

Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the value of the shares after the first year.**

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. So, the new price per share is:
\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

The value of all 8 shares after the first year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the value of the shares after the second year.**

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. So, the new price per share is:
\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

The value of all 8 shares after the second year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[ \$72 \]"
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the two equal groups each have 70 students. The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students, will have:

\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can write these as equations:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:
\[ 4C + 2H = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling with:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (balls added each week for 4 weeks) = 7 balls

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left is:

7 - 3 = 4 balls

But 2 of those balls are caught by people in the crowd, so he still has:

4 - 2 = 2 balls

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 2 balls.

2 balls"
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

The total weight of the animals is:
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) = 240 pounds

Adding the weight of the container, which is 20 pounds, we get:
240 + 20 = 260 pounds

"Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters. 

First, we calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, Tyson should run:
\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters per day} \]

June typically has 30 days. Therefore, the total distance Tyson would cover in June, if he trained as advised, would be:
\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180,000 \text{ meters} \]

The total distance Tyson covered in June is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag has 36 cookies.
2. Her son's lunch box gets 4 cookies, 5 days a week. So, the total number of cookies her son eats in a week is \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
3. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats \(1 \times 7 = 7\) cookies in a week.
4. The total number of cookies eaten by her son and her husband in a week is \(20 + 7 = 27\) cookies.
5. Therefore, the number of cookies Jenny eats is the total number of cookies minus the number of cookies eaten by her son and her husband, which is \(36 - 27 = 9\) cookies.

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after a 40% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
Each shirt costs $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts.
Total cost without discount = 2 * $30 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
The discount is 40%, so we need to find 40% of $60.
Discount amount = 40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.
Final amount paid = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
Final amount paid = $60 - $24 = $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find out what percentage more the factory is making per day now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily revenue from silos.
3. Find the difference between the two daily revenues.
4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the original revenue.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Daily revenue from tractors:**
   - Number of tractors sold per day: 10
   - Price per tractor: $100
   - Daily revenue from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

2. **Daily revenue from silos:**
   - Number of silos sold per day: 5
   - Price per silo: $220
   - Daily revenue from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

3. **Difference in daily revenue:**
   - Difference = Daily revenue from silos - Daily revenue from tractors
   - Difference = $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day

4. **Percentage increase:**
   - Percentage increase = (Difference / Original revenue) * 100%
   - Percentage increase = ($100/day / $1000/day) * 100% = 0.1 * 100% = 10%

The factory is making 10% more per day now.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To calculate the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to add up the costs for food, treats, and medicine for a full year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is $25 * 4 = $100.
   - For a year, the cost for food is $100 * 12 = $1200.

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for treats is $20 * 12 = $240.

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for medicine is $100 * 12 = $1200.

Now, we add up all the yearly costs:
- Yearly cost for food: $1200
- Yearly cost for treats: $240
- Yearly cost for medicine: $1200

Total yearly cost = $1200 + $240 + $1200 = $2640

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming:

- Boating: 6 hours
- Swimming: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total time John spent watching shows:

- Shows: 3 shows * 2 hours each = 6 hours

Now, we know that the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows (9 + 6 = 15 hours) is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time as \( T \). We can set up the equation:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:

\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \]

So, the total time John spent on vacation is 50 hours.

Now, we need to find out how much time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \]

Therefore, John spent 20 hours sightseeing."

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then we'll subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. Cost of one round of mini-golf: $5
2. Cost of go-karts (2 rides): $10 * 2 = $20
3. Arcade tokens: $5

Total cost for one person (Morgan and one friend):
$5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost for Morgan from her budget to see how much is left for her friends:
$90 (budget) - $30 (Morgan's cost) = $60

The remaining $60 will be used for the friends. Since the cost for one friend is $30, we can find out how many friends can be invited by dividing the remaining budget by the cost per friend:
$60 / $30 = 2

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

   2 \times \$2 = \$4
   \]

4. Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is:
   \[
   \$10 - \$4 = \$6
   \]

5. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy he bought is:
   \[
   \frac{\$6}{\$1.5 \text{ per pound}} = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Now, let's add up the distances for one complete trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily travel distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that many minus 5. So, we calculate:
   \[
   4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]
   Therefore, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters. So, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
   Therefore, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons:
   \[
   3 + 7 + 21 + x = 50
   \]
5. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   31 + x = 50

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many points Erin has now.
2. Subtract the points Erin scored from her current total to find out how many points she had before.

First, we know that after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara. Sara has 8 points, so three times Sara's points is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

This means Erin now has 24 points. Since she scored 14 points to reach this total, we can find out how many points she had before by subtracting 14 from 24:
\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - Additional cost for etching each frame is 20% of $20, which is $4.
   - Total cost per frame = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - Total cost for 44 seniors = 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so 1/4 * 44 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer receives a cord that costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Total cost for picture frames = $1056
- Total cost for pins = $10
- Total cost for cords = $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

The final numerical answer is:
$1198"
"To find out how much Ethan would save by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the $400 cost.

20% of $400 is calculated as follows:
\[ 20\% \times 400 = \frac{20}{100} \times 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, Ethan would save $80 by making his own wallpaper.

To find the total cost of making his own wallpaper, we subtract the savings from the original cost:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount of Saturday, which is:
\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

Final numerical answer:

"To calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to first determine the total interest she will pay over the five months and then add this to the principal amount. After that, we can divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $3,650
- Rate (\(R\)) = 10% or 0.10
- Time (\(T\)) = 5 months (which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) years, but since the rate is given as an annual rate, we can use the monthly time directly in the calculation)

First, calculate the total interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.085 \]

Now, add the interest to the principal to get the total amount to be paid:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.085 \]

Finally, divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month."
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Cho's time: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Chloe's time: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances they hiked:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

The total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, so:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups of lemonade} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take for Millie to sell all 36 cups of lemonade. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour, so:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. She sells each cup for $1, so:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue. The cost of supplies is $18, so:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

This is the total profit for the entire period. To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie will make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so 26 girls are initially planning to perform. However, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 26 / 2 = 13

Therefore, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so we add these 3 teachers to the number of girls performing:

Total number of people who sang in the performance = 13 (girls) + 3 (teachers) = 16

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11}\]
\[x = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services after the 20% discount for bundling.

The normal cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so without the discount, the total cost for both would be:
\[ $10 + $10 = $20 \]

With a 20% discount, the cost is reduced by 20% of $20:
\[ 20\% \times $20 = 0.20 \times $20 = $4 \]

So, the discounted cost for both Hulu and Disney Plus is:
\[ $20 - $4 = $16 \]

Adding the cost of Netflix, which is $10, the total cost for the streaming services is:
\[ $16 + $10 = $26 \]

Now, to find out how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. So, for 8 hours, it uses:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:

Adding these to the initial number of corns, the new total of corns is:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \text{ corns} \]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[ 100 + 100 = 200 \]

Final numerical answer:
200"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elliott finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 5,000 steps.
2. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
3. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we need to calculate the total steps he had taken before his jog and then subtract that from the total steps he needed to reach 10,000.

Total steps needed: 10,000
Steps taken before the jog: 5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (short walk with friend) = 6,000
Steps left after the jog: 2,000

So, the steps taken during the jog can be calculated as follows:

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps before the jog) - 2,000 (steps left after the jog) = 2,000 steps

Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport and it takes him 30 minutes to read the book. After reading, he needs to travel to the airport, which takes 10 minutes:

60 minutes - 30 minutes (reading) - 10 minutes (travel) = 20 minutes

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Add the payments from May and June to get the total amount.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for May = 40 × $15 × 40
Total payment for May = $24,000

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = 1/4 × 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for June = 30 × $15 × 40
Total payment for June = $18,000

**Step 4: Add the payments from May and June to get the total amount.**

Total amount paid = Total payment for May + Total payment for June
Total amount paid = $24,000 + $18,000
Total amount paid = $42,000

**Final Answer:**
$42,000"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which means it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, each costing $0.25. So, the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashell bag: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
$10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. It's worth twice the amount of the first pack, which is $400. So the second pack costs:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the first and second packs of fireworks:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the first and second packs. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original price. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

5 dozens"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. We can only work with the information given about the candles that smell like wet dog.

Given:
- 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
- Marcy makes 50,000 candles.

First, we need to find out how many of the 50,000 candles are considered ""more dangerous"" and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of these candles have this defect, we calculate:

\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

So, 2,500 candles smell like wet dog. However, the problem does not provide information on how many of these 2,500 candles also explode. Without this information, we cannot determine the exact number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

Therefore, based on the given information, the final numerical answer cannot be determined. If we assume that the 99% guarantee applies to the candles that do not smell like wet dog, then the 2,500 candles that smell like wet dog are not covered by this guarantee, but we still do not have the specific percentage of these that explode.

Final numerical answer: Cannot be determined with the given information."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

Step 1: Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
The regular price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. So, the discount on each blouse is 30% of $20.

\[ \text{Discount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discount price of one blouse is:

\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Step 2: Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses.
Misha picked 4 blouses, so the total cost is:

\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet. Let's call this number \(x\).

Joanne's total apples are:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Joanne's sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
- No apples from the average trees.

So, Joanne's sister's total apples are:
\[60 + 45 + 0 = 105\]

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[150 + x = 500\]

Subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

Final numerical answer:
\[350\]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( c + d = 180 \).
2. The total number of bumps (humps) is 304, which means \( 2c + d = 304 \) because camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each.

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

Final numerical answer:

"In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days, which is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} \times 0.30 = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \, \text{km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Adding all these distances together, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, the total number of kilometers Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches big."
"Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from an elevation of 10,000 feet, so the comb is now at an elevation of:

10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb:

6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the amounts he received from the banks to his initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000.
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is \(2 \times 4000 = 8000\).

So, the total amount from the banks is \(4000 + 8000 = 12000\).

Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get:

\[5000 + 12000 = 17000\]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. 

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:
4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is:
50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Then, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is:
3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

The number of cats left on the rock after some ran after the mouse is:
30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

Final answer: 12 cats"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. The first 6 months are at $8 per month.
2. The next 8 months are at $12 per month.
3. The remaining 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months in total) are at $14 per month.

Let's calculate the cost for each period:

1. Cost for the first 6 months: \(6 \times 8 = 48\) dollars.
2. Cost for the next 8 months: \(8 \times 12 = 96\) dollars.
3. Cost for the last 10 months: \(10 \times 14 = 140\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs from each period:

Total cost = \(48 + 96 + 140 = 284\) dollars.

2 years of the service cost him **284 dollars**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The tattered jeans cost $28.
2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.
3. Cole saved a total of $6 on the jeans.
4. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). We know \( T = 28 \) and \( J = 22 \).

The savings on the jogger jeans is \( J - 22 \) and the savings on the tattered jeans is \( T - 28 \).

According to the problem, the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of the total savings, so:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
This means the jogger jeans saved him $2, so the original price of the jogger jeans \( J \) must have been:
\[ J - 22 = 2 \]
\[ J = 24 \]

Now, we need to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:
\[ J - T = 24 - 28 = -4 \]

Since the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, and the result is negative, it means the tattered jeans originally cost $4 more than the jogger jeans. However, the question asks for the difference in the original cost of the jogger jeans compared to the tattered jeans, which is $4.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, we calculate the capacity of the 4 buses:
4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Next, we calculate the capacity of the 6 minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Then, we calculate the capacity of the 10 minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total capacity:
240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so the feeders she made attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, we can calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- For the 3 store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy a ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \) dollars.
- After buying the ticket for $100, he has $50 left for spending cash. So, the money he has after buying the ticket is \( x - 100 \) dollars, which is equal to $50.

We can set up the equation:
\[ x - 100 = 50 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially told to prepare for 36 guests.
2. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. So, half of 36 is 18 guests, and these 18 guests would get 2 hotdogs each, which means 36 hotdogs for these 18 guests.
3. The remaining 18 guests would get 1 hotdog each, which means 18 more hotdogs.
4. So, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 (for the first 18 guests) + 18 (for the remaining 18 guests) = 54 hotdogs.
5. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that 40 hotdogs were needed for the second hotdog for each of the 40 guests.
6. Since only 54 hotdogs were prepared, and 40 guests wanted a second hotdog, the number of hotdogs left after the first hotdog for each guest is 54 - 36 (the first hotdog for the 18 guests who got two) - 18 (the first hotdog for the remaining 18 guests) = 0. This means that all 54 hotdogs were used for the first hotdog, and there were no hotdogs left for the second hotdog.
7. Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 40 (the total number of guests who showed up) - 0 (the number of guests who got a second hotdog) = 40.

Final numerical answer:
40 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the cost of the pot and pans: $120.00
2. Calculate the cost of the mixing bowls: $20.00
3. Calculate the cost of the 5 separate utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, calculate the discount amount:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, the total cost is:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Dora has $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16, so the total amount of money Dora has is:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. George spent $5 in total.
2. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each.
3. He had 1% of his money left after the purchase.

First, calculate the total cost of the 3 bags of chips:
3 bags * 40 cents/bag = 120 cents = $1.20

Now, calculate how much money George had left after the purchase:
1% of $5 = 0.01 * $5 = $0.05

So, the amount George spent on candy bars is:
$5 - $1.20 - $0.05 = $3.75

Now, calculate how many candy bars he could buy with $3.75, given that each candy bar costs 75 cents:
$3.75 / $0.75 = 5

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so for 4 pounds, the cost is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, the beef stock costs $2.00 per box, and he needs 2 boxes, so the total cost for beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost for the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Therefore, the cost per serving is $2.00."

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

"Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth has:

1 pack of red * 20 pieces + 2 packs of clear * 20 pieces = 20 + 40 = 60 pieces of beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. So, Margareth has:

3 packs of blue * 20 pieces + 4 packs of red * 20 pieces = 60 + 80 = 140 pieces of beads.

To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number:

140 - 60 = 80

One sister has 80 more beads than the other.

80"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.
2. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.

So, the temperature increase from baking is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Adding this to the initial temperature:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. Marcus then opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

The cooling effect over 30 minutes is:
30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3
3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

Therefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so:

- Swim time for James = 40 minutes * (1 - 0.10) = 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

- Bike time for James = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Let's denote the time James took for the run as \( R \) minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

- Total time for James = 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we can set up the equation for James's total time:

\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):

\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

Final numerical answer:
59"
"Movie C was 1.25 hours long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60:

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   - The horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH).
   - It runs for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 32 MPH × 0.5 hours = 16 miles

2. **Calculate the amount of hay the horse eats:**
   - The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs.
   - Hay consumed = 16 miles × 1/2 a bail per mile = 8 bails of hay

3. **Calculate the cost of the hay:**
   - A bail of hay costs $3.
   - Total cost = 8 bails × $3 per bail = $24

4. **Calculate the amount of money Michael has:**
   - Michael has six 5 dollar bills.
   - Total money = 6 × $5 = $30

5. **Calculate the change after buying the hay:**
   - Change = Total money - Total cost
   - Change = $30 - $24 = $6

**Final numerical answer:**

"Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs equal 48 eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, Rozanne has a total of 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the total number of glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make is 50 eggs divided by 5 eggs per glass, which equals 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is the total number of glasses divided by the number of glasses per tray. So, 10 glasses divided by 5 glasses per tray equals 2 trays.

Final numerical answer:
2 trays"
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to calculate the total points for both Joey and Marcy after their respective turns and then find the difference between their scores.

First, let's calculate Joey's total points:
- Joey starts with 214 points.
- He scores an additional 26 points.
- Therefore, Joey's total points are \(214 + 26 = 240\).

Next, let's calculate Marcy's total points:
- Marcy starts with 225 points.
- She scores an additional 10 points.
- Therefore, Marcy's total points are \(225 + 10 = 235\).

Now, we find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's total points:
- Joey's total points: 240
- Marcy's total points: 235
- The difference is \(240 - 235 = 5\).

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points.

"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the department store.
4. Calculate the total revenue.
5. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The cost per sneaker is the total cost divided by the number of sneakers:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\$576}{48} = \$12
   \]

2. The total revenue from the flash sale is the number of sneakers sold at the flash sale multiplied by the price per sneaker:
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times \$20 = \$340
   \]

3. The number of sneakers sold to the department store is the total number of sneakers minus the number sold at the flash sale:
   \[
   \text{Sneakers sold to department store} = 48 - 17 = 31
   \]
   The total revenue from the department store is the number of sneakers sold to the department store multiplied by the price per sneaker:
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times \$25 = \$775
   \]

4. The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \$340 + \$775 = \$1115
   \]

5. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539
   \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539."

Therefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is:
112"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Super ticket: $20 + $1 for popcorn and soda = $21
2. Regular ticket: $12 + cost of popcorn + $3 for soda
3. You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the cost of the regular ticket and the popcorn and soda should be $2 more than the super ticket.

The cost of the super ticket is $21. Since you saved $2, the cost of the regular ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $21 + $2 = $23.

The regular ticket is $12, and the soda costs $3. Let \( P \) be the regular price of the popcorn. So, the equation for the regular ticket and the popcorn and soda is:

\[ 12 + P + 3 = 23 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 15 + P = 23 \]

Subtract 15 from both sides:

\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $8.

"To find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day.
2. Calculate the new cost of filling one helium balloon after the price increase.
3. Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.

First, we know that the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons on the first day was $900. Therefore, the cost of filling one balloon on the first day is:
\[ \text{Cost per balloon on the first day} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons at the new price:
\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find the car's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

1. For the first part of the trip:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total Volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. If there are 15 red cards and there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = 15 + (60% of 15)
Number of green cards = 15 + (0.60 * 15)
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we need to find out how many yellow cards there are. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, to find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, there are 78 cards of all mentioned colors."
"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.

After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn, which is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies.

These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that Katelyn saw, so the total number of fairies became 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, so the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) + 48 (carrots) + 2 (sugar cubes) = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since you can't make a fraction of a trip):

- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."

"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. 

The total cost before the discount is:
20 apples * $0.45/apple = $9.00

After the $1 discount, Becky paid:
$9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00

Now, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount.

The total cost before the discount is:
20 apples * $0.50/apple = $10.00

A 10 percent discount on $10.00 is:
10% of $10.00 = 0.10 * $10.00 = $1.00

So, the total cost after the discount is:
$10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00

Now, to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total:
$9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00

Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky."
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Benny saw two remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10\% \]"

- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)
- Total number of kids in the class, \( |U| = 32 \)

We need to find the number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the substances, which is \( |D \cup P| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we have:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances.

To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = |U| - |D \cup P| \]
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Final answer:
20"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to add the number of employees to the number of tour guides.

First, calculate the total number of employees:
3 groups * 200 employees per group = 600 employees

Next, calculate the total number of tour guides:
3 groups * 7 tour guides per group = 21 tour guides

Now, add the number of employees and tour guides to get the total number of people:
600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people

The total number of people going on this tour is 621."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. Plane tickets: $5000 each, so for two people, it's $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

2. Hotel cost: The normal price is $1500 per day. Since it's a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. So, the increased price per day is $1500 * 20% = $300. Therefore, the cost per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800. For 3 days, the total hotel cost is $1800 * 3 = $5400.

Adding the plane tickets and the hotel cost together, the total cost of the trip is $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The trip cost is $15,400."
"Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint.

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ tubes of blue paint} \]

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ tubes of yellow paint} \]

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint together:
\[ 2 + 9 = 11 \]

Jasper has 11 tubes of paint."
"The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add their weights together:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first add the amounts they have already earned:

Keegan's earnings: $83
Tashay's earnings: $91

Total earned: $83 + $91 = $174

Their goal is $200, so we subtract the total they have earned from their goal:

$200 - $174 = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, who has 20 songs. So, Luri has \(3 \times 20 = 60\) songs.

The maximum capacity of each player is 100 songs. Therefore, Gabriel can add \(100 - 20 = 80\) more songs to his player.

Similarly, Luri can add \(100 - 60 = 40\) more songs to his player.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\(80 - 40 = 40\)

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

40"
"To find out the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many oranges Stetson ate.
2. Multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount of money he gave up per orange.

First, we find out how many oranges Stetson ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money he gave up. Since he gave up $10 for each orange he ate, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by $10:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we can follow these steps:

2. Calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes: \(3 \times 80 = 240\).
3. Subtract $20 from the result to find the cost of her handbag: \(240 - 20 = 220\).

So, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220."
"James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so he runs a total of:

12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

If he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, then the total hours he runs a week is:

60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

Therefore, James runs 6 hours a week."
"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
2. Each horse is fed twice a day, so each horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).
3. Uncle Ben has four horses, so the total consumption per day for all horses is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).
4. For five days, the total consumption is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).
5. Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"Jana has 27 puppies, and two thirds of them are Pomeranians. So, the number of Pomeranians is:

Sally spends $32 in all."
"To find the cost per razor after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - She is buying 2 packs.
   - Total cost before discounts = 2 packs * $4.00/pack = $8.00.

2. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale:**
   - Since the offer is ""buy one get one free,"" she only pays for one pack and gets the second one free.
   - Cost after the sale = $4.00 (for the first pack).

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Subtract the coupon from the sale price.
   - Cost after the coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

4. **Calculate the cost per razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors = 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.
   - Cost per razor = Total cost after discounts / Total number of razors = $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

5. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - $0.25 = 25 cents.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to identify the height of the shortest cheerleader, as she will be at the top of the pyramid.

Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall, the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The height of the human pyramid will be the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

60 inches ÷ 12 = 5 feet

The height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours each day. So, each day she walks:

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is \(120 \div 3 = 40\).

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. So the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, and food is already included. So the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects David found as \( D \), the number of insects Bodhi found as \( B \), and the number of insects Lily found as \( L \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, we substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \( D = 9 \), we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \( 16 \) insects.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
2. Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.

Step 1: Total calories to burn
Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb. Therefore, the total calories to burn is:
\[ 30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 2: Number of days
Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Julie starts with $500.
2. She spends 20% of it on clothes. 
   - 20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100
   - So, she spends $100 on clothes.
3. After buying clothes, she has $500 - $100 = $400 left.
4. She then spends 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
   - 25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

5. After buying CDs, she has $400 - $100 = $300 left.

Therefore, Julie has $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"To calculate the profit Tara earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) canvas bags.
Each pack cost $4, so the total cost is \(40 \times 4 = \$160\).

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags.
Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is \(40 \times 8 = \$320\).

Step 3: Calculate the profit.
Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, so the profit is \(320 - 160 = \$160\).

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is $160."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has:

- Ali has four $10 bills, so the total from the $10 bills is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali has six $20 bills, so the total from the $20 bills is \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total amount of money Ali has is \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars.

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is \(\frac{160}{2} = 80\) dollars. This leaves Ali with \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars.

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48\) dollars.

Subtracting the amount used for dinner from the remaining money, Ali has \(80 - 48 = 32\) dollars left.

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Chris starts with 100 math problems.
2. On Monday, he completes 12 problems.
3. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) problems.
4. After Monday and Tuesday, the number of problems left is \(100 - 12 - 36 = 52\).
5. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13\) problems.
6. After Wednesday, the number of problems left is \(52 - 13 = 39\).

So, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 39."
"Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 5 * 2 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

To find the total number of quarts of strawberries they can pick per hour together, we add their individual rates:

Tony: 6 quarts/hour
Bobby: 5 quarts/hour
Kathy: 10 quarts/hour
Ricky: 8 quarts/hour

Total: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts/hour

Therefore, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick a total of 29 quarts of strawberries per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm."
"The bakers started with 200 loaves of bread. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, so they sold a total of:

93 + 39 = 132 loaves.

After selling 132 loaves, the number of loaves left would be:

200 - 132 = 68 loaves.

Then, a grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves, so the total number of loaves left would be:

68 + 6 = 74 loaves.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine the number of rows Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) rows.

Next, we calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \) rows.

Now, we add the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips:
- Total number of rows = 6 (red) + 3 (blue) = 9 rows.

The final numerical answer is:
9 rows."
"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Divide the total amount of raisins equally among the three items (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix).
2. Calculate how many cups of raisins are used for the oatmeal cookies.
3. Determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with the raisins allocated to the cookies.

First, we divide the 27 cups of raisins equally among the three items:

\[ \text{Raisins per item} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we use the 9 cups of raisins for the oatmeal cookies. Since each batch of oatmeal cookies takes \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a cup of raisins, we can calculate the number of batches by dividing the raisins allocated to the cookies by the amount needed per batch:

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Ada's current daily electric consumption.
2. Calculate Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device.
3. Calculate the weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.
4. Calculate the weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device.
5. Find the difference between the two weekly electric bills.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. Ada's current daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
2. The new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour, so her total daily consumption after adding the new device will be:
   \[
   12 \text{ kW/h} + 2 \text{ kW/h} = 14 \text{ kW/h}
   \]
3. The weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is:
   \[
   12 \text{ kW/h} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 2016 \text{ kW/week}
   \]
4. The weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is:
   \[
   14 \text{ kW/h} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 2352 \text{ kW/week}
   \]
5. The weekly electric bill before adding the new device is:
   \[
   2016 \text{ kW/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$3024
   \]
6. The weekly electric bill after adding the new device is:
   \[
   2352 \text{ kW/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$3528
   \]
7. The difference between the two weekly electric bills is:
   \[
   \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504
   \]

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \(\boxed{504}\)."
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

Now, if 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be 5 times the rate of one person. So, 5 people can paint a whole house in 10/5 = 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours.

48 hours"
"Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Ophelia's sofas: 20
Ophelia's chairs: 22
Jenna's sofas: 64
Jenna's chairs: 66

Total number of sofas: 20 + 64 = 84
Total number of chairs: 22 + 66 = 88

Total number of sofas and chairs: 84 + 88 = 172

"To find out how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how much money Tom would have left if he didn't buy the headphone set.
3. Determine how many CDs he could buy with the remaining money.

First, we know that Tom paid a total of $48 for the CD and the headphone set. The CD cost $4, so we can find the cost of the headphone set by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount paid:

\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \$48 - \$4 = \$44 \]

Next, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we can find out how many CDs he could buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one CD:

\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{\$48}{\$4} = 12 \]

Since Tom already bought one CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

\[ 12 - 1 = 11 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

First, we know that for 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total hours for these 6 weeks is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he worked out for 5 hours each for 2 consecutive weeks. So, the total hours for these 2 weeks is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Additionally, he worked out for 6 hours in one week. So, the total hours for this week is:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all the hours:
\[ 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so currently, Jame is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

2. In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

3. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, Jame's cousin will be 2 * 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

4. To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 55: 55 - 8 = 47 years old.

Now, to find the number of years that separate the age of the two now, we subtract Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:

47 - 22 = 25

The number of years that separate the age of the two now is 25."
"Given:
- Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400.
- He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer.
- The computer cost $1,100.

First, let's find the cost of the printer:
- The printer cost $400 less than the computer.
- Therefore, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
- The computer cost $1,100.
- The printer cost $700.
- Together, they cost $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. So, the cost of the 2 monitors is:
- $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is:
- $600 / 2 = $300.

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"The boys brought back 60 shells each. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the girls brought back 60 (the same as the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times as many as the boys) shells.

Let's calculate that:

4 * 60 = 240

So, the girls brought back 60 + 240 = 300 shells.

Since the girls were divided into two equal groups, each group of girls brought back half of the total number of shells the girls brought.

300 / 2 = 150

Each girl brought back 150 seashells.

"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 31 mm * 2 = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should do to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these up: \(18 + 21 + 15 = 54\) vlogs.

Now, to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\(72 - 54 = 18\)

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The total bill is $50.
2. The tip is 20% of the total bill.
3. The tip amount is 20% of $50, which is \( 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \) dollars.
4. Since you want to pay the additional 20% tip, you will pay the full bill plus the tip.

So, the total amount you end up paying is the bill plus the tip:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys. This is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]
   So, each boy gets $6 initially.

2. The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
   \[
   6 + 5 = 11

   So, he now has $21.

4. He then spends $8 from his total:
   \[
   21 - 8 = 13

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of days in the first and second halves of the month:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April has 15 days.
   - The second half of April has 15 days.

2. **Define the daily savings for the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

3. **Define the daily savings for the second half:**
   - According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half. Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half:**
   - Total savings for the first half = \( 15x \).

5. **Calculate the total savings for the second half:**
   - Total savings for the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

6. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - Total monthly savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half.
   - \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

7. **Set the total monthly savings equal to the target:**
   - \( 45x = 1125 \).

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \).
   - \( x = 25 \).

9. **Determine the daily savings for the second half:**
   - Daily savings in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month."

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 additional bottles

So, Bill will need to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, twice the time it takes him in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that, he takes \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we calculate the total time for 3 miles in both conditions:

- Cold water: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes
- Warm water: \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes

The difference in time is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."

Now, we add the cost of both subs to find the total cost of your lunch:

\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost of your lunch today at Subway is $160."
"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the number of buttons with four holes.
2. Calculate the total number of holes from both types of buttons.

First, we know that there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes. So, the number of buttons with 4 holes is:
21 - 7 = 14 buttons

Now, we can calculate the total number of holes:

- The 7 buttons with 2 holes contribute: 7 * 2 = 14 holes
- The 14 buttons with 4 holes contribute: 14 * 4 = 56 holes

Adding these together gives us the total number of holes:
14 + 56 = 70

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70."
"Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so:

\[ \text{Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so:

\[ \text{Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ cubic inches} = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the daily recommended cups of coffee be \( x \).
2. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups, so she drinks \( \frac{x}{2} \) cups.
3. Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{x}{2} = 5x \) cups.
4. Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, which means \( x = 4 \).

Now, we need to find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake. Currently, Juan drinks \( 5x \) cups, and he needs to reduce it to 4 cups.

Substituting \( x = 4 \) into the equation for Juan's current coffee intake:
\[ 5x = 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

So, Juan currently drinks 20 cups of coffee daily. To meet the doctor's recommendation, he needs to reduce his intake to 4 cups. The reduction needed is:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"The pet shop had 6 cages of rodents in total. 

3 cages have 10 hamsters each, so that's 3 * 10 = 30 hamsters.

The other 3 cages have 5 guinea pigs each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

Adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together gives us the total number of rodents:

30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents.

The pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"Mark weighs 150 pounds.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs:
150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs:
2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

To find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and divide by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

1. The initial angle of the sun from the ground is the same as the angle of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour.
3. After 10 hours, the sun will have moved \(5 \times 10 = 50\) degrees.

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid (32 degrees from the ground) and moves straight upward, the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the initial angle plus the angle it has moved:

\[32 + 50 = 82\]

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

"The younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

So, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3, so to find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Therefore, the total cost for the candles is 4 packs * $3/pack = $12.

James spends $12 on candles."
"In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so the total reading time in the first week is:

15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes

Given that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can calculate how many pages she read in the first week:

105 minutes / 1.5 minutes/page * 2 pages = 70 pages

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

70 pages (first week) + 100 pages (second week) = 170 pages

170 pages"
"Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches, which is:

Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Together, they ate:

\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \]

So, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \]

5 sandwiches are left."
"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). According to the problem, at that time, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"Let's break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $1.00 for each tooth, so that's 3 teeth * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, for the last two teeth, that's 2 teeth * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the amounts:

$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."
"Richie scored 80 goals.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, Mark scored:
80 - 20 = 60 goals

And since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, Anna scored:
80 - 45 = 35 goals

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add up the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
80 + 60 + 35 = 175 goals

Therefore, all three teenagers scored a total of 175 goals."
"To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we need to calculate the total amount of money each of them made and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how much money Mitchell made:
- Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each.
- So, Mitchell's total earnings = 21 * $4 = $84.

Next, we know that Liam made $63.

Now, we find the difference between Mitchell's and Liam's earnings:
- Difference = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings
- Difference = $84 - $63 = $21.

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Peter has $70 to spend over one week (7 days).
2. He spends an equal amount each day, so he spends $70 / 7 = $10 each day.
3. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. That's 4 days.
4. The total amount spent on wooden action figures is $10/day * 4 days = $40.
5. The number of wooden action figures he can buy is $40 / $5 = 8 action figures.
6. After Wednesday, he has $70 - $40 = $30 left.
7. For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. That's 4 days.
8. The total amount he can spend on plastic action figures is $30.
9. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is $30 / $2 = 15 action figures.
10. The total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 8 (wooden) + 15 (plastic) = 23 action figures.

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month (assuming an average month has about 4 weeks).
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per month.
4. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
5. Find the difference between the number of roses Ford grows in a month and the number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

Let's start with step 1:

Ford supplies:
- 20 roses to the first flower shop
- 15 roses to the second flower shop
- 30 roses to the third flower shop

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 2: Assuming an average month has 4 weeks, the total number of roses supplied per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Step 3: Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month (4 weeks), he grows:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Step 4: Now, we find the difference between the number of roses Ford grows in a month and the number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month:
260 roses needed - 160 roses grown = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To calculate how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to determine how many months are in 2 years and then calculate the total amount removed from the account.

1 year = 12 months
2 years = 2 * 12 = 24 months

Katina removes $100 from the account every month, so over 24 months, she will remove:
$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

After 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account."
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Cost of Bread:**
   - Each loaf of bread costs $3.00.
   - Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.

2. **Cost of Cheeses and Condiments:**
   - They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

3. **Total Cost per Sandwich:**
   - The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and the cost of cheeses and condiments.
   - Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30.

4. **Revenue per Sandwich:**
   - They sell each sandwich for $7.00.

5. **Net Profit per Sandwich:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting:

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the intended temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is then:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means Maggie's oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature would result in 520 degrees when the oven is 4% too hot.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Since the oven is 4% too hot, the actual temperature will be 104% of the setting temperature. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 + 5 = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 + 125 = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% less than the value of Herb's house, which is $76,000.

First, we calculate 30% of $76,000:

Next, we subtract this amount from the value of Herb's house to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Judy brought 24 dishes, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is 12 (Judy's cups) + 40 (friend's cups) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by both Judy and her friend is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120 utensils.

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts, so 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total hours worked by Jill:
- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday.
- Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours worked by John:
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both John and Jill:
- Tabitha pays $10 per hour.
- Jill's total earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's total earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

For running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed (in ml) = (Total calories burned / 200) * 100

Plugging in the numbers:

Total water needed (in ml) = (1600 / 200) * 100
Total water needed (in ml) = 8 * 100
Total water needed (in ml) = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- Cost of boots: $13
- Shipping cost: Twice the cost of Amazon's shipping, which is 2 * $4 = $8
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we find the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon:
- Total cost on eBay: $21
- Total cost on Amazon: $20
- Difference: $21 - $20 = $1

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles its height every day and starts at 4 feet tall.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk each day:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet required to be taller than Mark's window.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain twice as much protein:

\[ 200 \text{ grams} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

So, John gets 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms each day.

Next, we need to find out how much protein he gets in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week:

\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:

\[ -J = -10 \]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

2. For one of the implants, there's an extra cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we can find the measures of the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Final answer:
90 degrees"
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in nickels. Here's the breakdown:

- Colby has 8 quarters, which are worth 25 cents each, but we only need to know the total in nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes, which are worth 10 cents each, but again, we only need to know the total in nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which are worth 5 cents each.
- Colby has 15 pennies, which are worth 1 cent each, but we only need to know the total in nickels.

First, let's convert all his money into nickels:

- 8 quarters = 8 * 5 nickels = 40 nickels
- 6 dimes = 6 * 5 nickels = 30 nickels
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 nickels = 70 nickels
- 15 pennies = 15 / 5 nickels = 3 nickels

Now, let's add up all the nickels:

40 nickels + 30 nickels + 70 nickels + 3 nickels = 143 nickels

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 143 gumballs.

Final numerical answer:
143"
"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
- Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
- Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Adding these together gives us the total number of legs:

20 legs (dogs) + 8 legs (cats) + 20 legs (birds) = 48 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \text{ pounds}) = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, the weight turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games on Birthday**: Steve gets 5 games on his birthday.
2. **Games Bought in the First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
3. **Games Bought in the Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
4. **Games Bought in the Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.
5. **Games Received for Christmas**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, so he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add all these up:

- Initial games: 5
- Games from the first year: 12
- Games from the second year: 24
- Games from the third year: 48
- Games from Christmas: 15

Total number of games = \(5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104\)

So, after 3 years, Steve has 104 games."
"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we multiply the total amount they can make in one hour by 12:

\[ 105 \times 12 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ 1260 \text{ pounds} \]"
"Let's break down the spending:

- On Monday, Howard spends $8.
- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money Howard spent:

\[8 + 16 + 64 = 88\]

Howard originally had $100. So, the amount of money he has left is:

\[100 - 88 = 12\]

Therefore, Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total money Patrick earned, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- So, in one hour, he earned 15 cups * $0.50 = $7.50.
- Over four hours, he earned 4 hours * $7.50 = $30.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- So, in one hour, he earned 10 cups * $0.60 = $6.00.
- Over two hours, he earned 2 hours * $6.00 = $12.

Now, we add the earnings from both parts:
- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per month.
2. Calculate the total number of rotations per year.
3. Determine how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

First, we know that every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. So, the number of rotations per month is:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Next, we calculate the number of rotations per year:

\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations:

\[ \text{Years before replacement} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

So, the tire will need to be replaced in 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:

\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, and it provides 120 washings:

\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the cost per washing to cents:

\[ \text{Cost per washing in cents} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents per washing} \]

Now, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the cost per washing by the number of washings per pump:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{20 \text{ cents}}{60 \text{ washings}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ cents} \approx 0.3333 \text{ cents} \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost per pump is:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 0.33 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the discount on the shirt:**
   - The original price of the shirt is $25.
   - The discount is 30%, so the discount amount is \( 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \).
   - The sale price of the shirt is \( 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \).

2. **Calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts:**
   - The sale price of the shirt is $17.50.
   - The price of the shorts is $35.
   - The total cost before tax is \( 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \).

3. **Determine if the total cost exceeds Joe's budget:**
   - Joe has $50.
   - The total cost is $52.50.
   - Since $52.50 is more than $50, Joe cannot afford the outfit with the given budget.

4. **Calculate the remaining money:**
   - Since Joe cannot afford the outfit, the remaining money is $0.

"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

The cost to repave Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$95,060 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Difference} = \$95,060 - \$29,100 = \$65,960 \]

Therefore, it costs \(\boxed{65960}\) more to repave Lewis' street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 5 months.

1. **Cost for the first 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000

2. **Cost for the remaining 5 months:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the remaining 5 months are part of the total 50 months of research.
   - Each of these months cost 50% more than the initial $100,000.
   - Therefore, the cost per month for the remaining 5 months is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.

Now, we can calculate the total cost:

- Cost for the first 5 months: $100,000 * 5 = $500,000
- Cost for the remaining 5 months: $150,000 * 5 = $750,000

Adding these together gives the total cost of the research:

$500,000 + $750,000 = $1,250,000

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is $1,250,000."

3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to reach the required height of 4 feet:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will need 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To calculate how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Total Revenue from Selling the Cars:**
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Total Cost to Acquire the Cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **James's Commission on the Profit:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{17,500}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we have:

\[ 100 \text{ riders} \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders can stay upright} \]

Next, we know that 60% of these riders who can stay upright are women. Therefore, the number of women who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women can stay upright} \]

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women who can stay upright from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} - 15 \text{ women} = 10 \text{ men can stay upright} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \text{ men can stay upright} \]"
"Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

Price of a gold jewel = \(\frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600\)

The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel:

Price of a silver jewel = 1600 - 400 = 1200

Now, to find the total price for all three jewels, we add the prices together:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Naomi caught 17 fish.

Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught:
17 - 6 = 11 fish.

Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught:
11 + 3 = 14 fish.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to first calculate the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes. Then, we'll figure out how many classes he can miss without the cost per class exceeding $10.

1. Calculate the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes:
   \[
   \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class}
   \]

2. Determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss without the cost per class exceeding $10:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss.
   - If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes.
   - The cost per class in this scenario would be:
     \[
     \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
     \]
   - We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
     \[
     \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     60 \leq 10(10 - x)
     \]
     \[
     60 \leq 100 - 10x
     \]
     \[
     10x \leq 40
     \]
     \[
     x \leq 4
     \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. 

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many customers Julie processes per day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers each processes in a week.
3. Add the weekly totals to get the combined total.

First, we know that Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers per day.

Next, we calculate the weekly production for each:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day, so in a week (7 days), she processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers.
- Julie processes 100 customers per day, so in a week, she processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers.

Adding these together, the total weekly production for the two is \(350 + 700 = 1050\).

Final numerical answer:
1050"
"Paisley ran 4 miles. 

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. Calculate the cost of one apple:
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30.

2. Calculate the cost of one orange:
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10.

3. Calculate the total cost for 5 apples:
   - The cost of one apple is $1.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of 5 apples is $1.30 × 5 = $6.50.

4. Calculate the total cost for 5 oranges:
   - The cost of one orange is $1.10.
   - Therefore, the cost of 5 oranges is $1.10 × 5 = $5.50.

5. Calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
   - The total cost is $6.50 (for apples) + $5.50 (for oranges) = $12.00.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the added features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[
30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500
\]

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

New monthly salary = Original monthly salary + (Original monthly salary * 5%)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + ($20,000 * 0.05)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000
New monthly salary = $21,000

Next, we add the bonus worth half a month's salary to the new monthly salary:

New monthly salary with bonus = New monthly salary + (New monthly salary / 2)
New monthly salary with bonus = $21,000 + ($21,000 / 2)
New monthly salary with bonus = $21,000 + $10,500
New monthly salary with bonus = $31,500

Now, to find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we multiply his new monthly salary with bonus by 12:

Annual salary = New monthly salary with bonus * 12
Annual salary = $31,500 * 12
Annual salary = $378,000

Therefore, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."
"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 3 * 10 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts.
   - Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final numerical answer is:
$10800."

"To find the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total miles biked by both:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

The total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He has to dig 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay, which is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour.
- He has to dig 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
2. The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats in the first month. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were $400 * 2 = $800.
3. The total sales in the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.
4. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month were $1200 * 3/4 = $900.
5. The total sales over the two months would be the sum of the sales from the first and second months, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.
2. The monthly cost for the hanger is $5,000.
3. The monthly cost for fuel is twice the hanger cost, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000.

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for hanger and fuel:
$5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

For the first year, there are 12 months, so the total cost for hanger and fuel for the year is:
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the yearly cost of hanger and fuel:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

- Difference in cost: \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars

Therefore, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We can set up the following system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm."
"The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but Roger had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. 

First, we calculate the cost of the more expensive brand:
\[ \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = \$5 + (20\% \times \$5) = \$5 + \$1 = \$6 \text{ per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Therefore, he buys 7 pounds of coffee:
\[ \text{Cost of 7 pounds of coffee} = 7 \times \$6 = \$42 \]

He also buys himself a donut for $2.

1. Cost of 2 bags of chips: $2.00 each, so 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
2. Cost of the bucket of fried chicken: $8.00
3. Cost of the bottle of soda: $1.00

Now, let's add up the cost of these items:
$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Gus spent a total of $20.00, so the cost of the apple pie is:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)

Now, let's do the math:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total hours of class time.

First, let's find the total number of hours John spends in the class. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, and it lasts for 6 weeks. So, the total number of hours is:

\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total number of hours by 1.5:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's find out how many of the 150 teachers are history teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers, so:
\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \text{ history teachers} \]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:
\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \text{ math teachers} \]

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
\[ 60 \text{ math teachers} \times 6 \text{ hours/teacher} = 360 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
360 hours"
"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they have together:

\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally among them, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{3} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, each person would have $120 if they decided to share the money equally."
"The game is typically 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long, so the standard game length is:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since there was a tie in the last quarter and the game was extended for five minutes, we add that to the standard game length:

48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"First, let's find out how many employees are in management:

20% of 50 employees = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees

Now, out of these 10 management employees, only 30% oversee the entire company:

30% of 10 employees = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees

So, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3."
"To find out how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need to make 16 muffins, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for one muffin, and then multiply by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoon

Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons

For 16 muffins:
Total dry ingredients = 8.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins."
"To find out how much candy each person would have if they shared equally, we first need to calculate the total amount of candy they have together.

Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. So, the total amount of candy is:

3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Now, if they share the candy equally among the three of them, we divide the total amount of candy by 3:

12 pounds ÷ 3 = 4 pounds

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.

Each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find out how much change Adam got, we first need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is:
7 * $0.5 = $3.50

The cost of 10 candies of type B is:
10 * $0.75 = $7.50

The total cost of the candies is:
$3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00

Adam paid $15, so the change he received is:
$15 - $11.00 = $4.00

Therefore, Adam got $4.00 in change."
"Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since the first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the following 8 days were neutral, we can calculate the number of neutral days as follows:

Total days - (Good days + Bad days) = Neutral days
30 - (12 + 8) = 10 neutral days

This means that out of the 8 neutral days, 2 were not part of the initial 8 neutral days (since 10 - 8 = 2).

Now, if the next three days were good, neutral, and good, we can update the count of good and neutral days:

Good days: 12 (initial) + 2 (next three days) = 14 good days
Neutral days: 10 (initial) + 1 (next three days) = 11 neutral days

The question asks for the number of good days left in the month. Since the month has 30 days and we have accounted for 14 good days, 8 bad days, and 11 neutral days, the number of good days left in the month is:

14 good days

Final numerical answer:
14"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 2S + 3 \]

We are also given that Janey has 21 books. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Final numerical answer:
9"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total height increase needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the required additional height.

Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total height increase needed.
- Target height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Height increase needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional height.
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Days required = Height increase needed / Growth rate = 360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days

Final answer:
12 days"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are now 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12.
3. James needs to buy 12 toys for these 12 dogs.
4. After buying the toys, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means the number of dogs has doubled, so the new total number of dogs is 12 * 2 = 24.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21.
7. Since there are 21 dogs, James needs 21 toys.

Now, let's add up all the toys James needs to buy:

- First purchase: 12 toys
- Second purchase: 12 toys
- Third purchase: 21 toys

Total toys needed: 12 + 12 + 21 = 45

So, Skyler's investment is $240."
"To reach their goal of 100 signatures, we first need to find out how many signatures they currently have together. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures, so together they have:

20 + 44 = 64 signatures

To find out how many more signatures they need to collect to reach 100, we subtract the number of signatures they currently have from their goal:

100 - 64 = 36

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"Lorie earns $10 per hour. Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, so Karen earns $20 per hour.

If Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings are:
$20/hour * 3 hours/day = $60/day

Over two days, Karen earns:
$60/day * 2 days = $120

Karen earns $120 in two days."
"To solve this, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

So, for 96 potatoes, we can calculate the number of hash browns as follows:

\[
\frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives us:

\[
6x = 96 \times 36
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{96 \times 36}{6} = 16 \times 36 = 576

1. Calculate the total weight of the 9 adults:
   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
   - Total weight of 9 adults = 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg.

2. Subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight:
   - Maximum load of the elevator = 700 kg.
   - Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
4. Katarina has 68 cookies.

First, we can find out how many cookies Max has. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + 5 \]
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 68 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 73 \]

Next, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + 12 \]
\[ 73 = \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + 12 \]
\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = 73 - 12 \]
\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = 61 \]

Now, we can find out how many cookies Summer has. Since Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 \]
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = 73 + 23 \]
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = 96 \]

Finally, we can find the total number of cookies they have by adding up the cookies each person has:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. She also adds 20 cm to the bottom with a lace trim. Therefore, the total length of the dress after these modifications is:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

Final answer: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times for both modes to find the total time it took Chris to mow the entire lawn:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

To find out how much time they have left, we subtract the time they have already spent from the total time they have:

30 minutes (total time) - 6 minutes (to the corner) - 13 minutes (to the fire station) = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of that twin would be \( x + 7 \).

The other triplet and the other twin would be the same age as the younger triplet and the younger twin, respectively, because they are part of a set of twins and a set of triplets. So, the age of the other triplet is also \( x \), and the age of the other twin is also \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of all four individuals are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 4x + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the age of the younger triplet is 7.5 years. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the younger triplet, is:

\[ x + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 14.5 years old."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his homework and then subtract that from the 3 hours he has before he has to eat dinner.

First, let's convert the 3 hours into minutes:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, let's add up the time for his homework:
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Finally, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner:
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Manolo bought five lollipops, so the cost of the lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Next, we know that the total cost of four candies and five lollipops is $3.20. We already calculated that the five lollipops cost $2.00, so the cost of the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost of the four candies by 4:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

So, each candy costs $0.30. Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of coins each person has saved over a period of ten years, given their monthly savings rates.

First, let's determine how many coins Rong saves in a month and then over ten years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Over ten years, which is 120 months (10 years * 12 months/year), Rong will save:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, let's calculate how many coins Neil saves in a month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong each month. So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins} \right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

Over ten years, which is 120 months, Neil will save:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, we add the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have saved together after ten years is:
\[ 5760 \text{ coins} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the cost of the vaccines:
   - Each vaccine costs $20, and the dog needs 2 vaccines.
   - Total cost for vaccines = $20 * 2 = $40.

2. Let the cost of the heartworm check be \( x \).

3. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. So, we can write:
   - \( x = 0.60 \times \text{Total Bill} \).

4. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
   - Total Bill = $40 + \( x \).

5. Substitute \( x \) from step 3 into the equation for the total bill:
   - Total Bill = $40 + 0.60 \times \text{Total Bill}.

6. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). So, we have:
   - \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

7. Solve for \( T \):
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \),
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \),
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \),
   - \( T = 100 \).

So, the total bill is $100.

8. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

The price for such a crate of fruit is **32 dollars**."
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 4 more than red squares, so \(14 + 4 = 18\)
3. Green squares: 6 more than blue squares, so \(18 + 6 = 24\)
4. White squares: 12 fewer than green squares, so \(24 - 12 = 12\)

Now, we add up all the squares:
\[14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68\]

Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs currently available and then compare it to the number of chairs required for the function.

1. Calculate the number of regular chairs:
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   - There are 8 high chairs.
   - Therefore, the number of regular chairs is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

2. Calculate the total number of chairs currently available:
   - The total number of chairs is the sum of regular chairs and high chairs.
   - So, \(40 + 8 = 48\) chairs are currently available.

3. Calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function:
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function.
   - Therefore, the total number of chairs needed is \(42 + 15 = 57\).

4. Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:
   - The number of additional chairs needed is the difference between the number of chairs needed and the number of chairs currently available.
   - So, \(57 - 48 = 9\).

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points = 50 + (30/100 * 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points = 65 - 30 = 35 points.
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Martha's points = 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:

Adam's points: 50
Betty's points: 65
Tom's points: 35
Martha's points: 105

Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. So, the class is missing:

400 - 255 = 145 points

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."

"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city.
2. Determine how many of those fireworks Hannah will see.
3. Calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard.
4. Add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city display to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, the total number of fireworks set off by the city is:
   \[
   15 \times 20 = 300
   \]

2. Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. So, the number of fireworks Hannah will see from the city display is:
   \[
   300 \times 0.40 = 120
   \]

3. Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. So, the total number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard is:
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15
   \]

4. To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks she sees from the city display to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard:

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

13 + 7 = 20

Each person saves a seat and buys drinks and snacks for the seat. Each seat requires 2 drinks and 3 snacks. Since drinks and snacks cost $2 each, we can calculate the cost for drinks and snacks per seat:

Cost of drinks per seat = 2 drinks * $2/drink = $4
Cost of snacks per seat = 3 snacks * $2/snack = $6

Total cost per seat = Cost of drinks + Cost of snacks = $4 + $6 = $10

Since there are 20 seats, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:

Total cost = 20 seats * $10/seat = $200

Therefore, the group has spent a total of $200 on snacks and drinks."
"Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so:
\[ 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

When Gary's truck joins, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. So, the amount Gary's truck can haul is:
\[ 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"Each female ate 3 dumplings. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females, which is 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.

Final numerical answer:
50"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald received 3 parts, so he got 3 * $20 = $60.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, he would have $60 - $10 = $50 left.

Therefore, Gerald had $50 left."
"The cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second

To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount to be raised is:

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Next, we need to find out how much money they raised in the first 3 hours. Since the problem states that the amount raised is equal in every hour, we can calculate the hourly rate by dividing the amount raised in the first 3 hours by 3:

$2100 / 3 = $700 per hour

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to reach the remaining goal of $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate:

$4200 / $700 = 6 hours

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours to reach their goal.

Therefore, in total, they need to fundraise for:

3 hours (already done) + 6 hours (remaining) = 9 hours

Final numerical answer:
9"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

"To calculate how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in 2 weeks.
2. Multiply the number of days by the daily rate.

Step 1: There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, there are:
\[ 7 \text{ days/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Step 2: Alex charges $12 per day, so for 14 days, the total charge is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times \$12/\text{day} = \$168 \]

Therefore, Alex charges \(\$168\) for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To find out how many quarts of ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours, we need to determine the production rate for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then calculate the total production for 48 hours.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we need to calculate the total production for 48 hours:
- For chocolate ice cream, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the production of both types of ice cream to get the total production:
- Total production in 48 hours = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00 and subtract it from the total:

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

Total bill after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how the deal works. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, if she buys 2 scoops, she gets 3 scoops in total. 

If she buys 4 scoops, she would get 2 free scoops (since 4/2 = 2), making a total of 6 scoops.

Therefore, Erin should buy 4 scoops to maximize her ice cream consumption with the deal.

4 scoops"
"Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:

\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Both started with 100 pieces of candy, so after two weeks:

- Ginger will have:

\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

- Amy will have:

\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's:

\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks."

"Bryce and his four friends make a total of 5 people. Each person ordered one pizza, and each pizza has 12 slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices:
5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices

Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, for each of these 3 people, the number of slices eaten is:
(2/3) * 12 slices = 8 slices

Total slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends:
3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. So, for each of these 2 people, the number of slices eaten is:
(3/4) * 12 slices = 9 slices

Total slices eaten by the two remaining friends:
2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices

Total slices eaten by all five friends:
24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Now, to find the number of slices left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices:
60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

"Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( B \) inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be written as:
\[ 9B + 10 \]

We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \) inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of one of Topher's shoes is:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 9B + 10 = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 9B = 90 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:
\[ B = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches.

"To find out how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows she smashes for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in the students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in the teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the number of windows smashed for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, Hannah smashes a total of 112 windows."

"Dora is 15 years old.

First, let's calculate Dora's father's age:
Dora's father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Dora's father's age = 30 + 8
Dora's father's age = 38

Next, let's calculate Dora's mother's age:
Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4
Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4
Dora's mother's age = 34

Now, let's calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."

"Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received:

\[ 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. So, candidate B received:

\[ 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

The total number of votes is 100. The votes for candidate C can be found by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

So, candidate C got 50 votes."
"Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has:

100 - 23 = 77 apples.

If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

100 - 10 = 90 apples.

And Beck will have:

77 + 10 = 87 apples.

Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange, we subtract Beck's apples from Boris's apples:

90 - 87 = 3 apples.

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now."
"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes = 3 * 4 ounces = 12 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes = 7 * 2 ounces = 14 ounces.

Then, let's calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 ounce.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = 8 * 1/2 ounce = 4 ounces.

Now, let's add up the total water used:
- Total water used = 12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
- Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces.

Therefore, Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"Given that Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can determine that Steven has:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{\text{Clara's books}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

"To find out how many students like to play video games, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games or play music.
3. Use the given relationship between the number of students who like to play music and those who like to play basketball to find the exact number of students who like to play video games.

Let's start with step 1:

- Number of students who like to bake: 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball: 5

Total number of students who like to bake or play basketball = 10 + 5 = 15

Now, step 2:

Total number of students in the class = 50
Number of students who like to play video games or play music = 50 - 15 = 35

For step 3, we know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:

Number of students who like to play music = 2 * 5 = 10

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:

Number of students who like to play video games = 35 - 10 = 25

"To determine how much Jake's family can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $26, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for adults is \(26 \times 2 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for each child is $12, and there are 2 children, so the total cost for children is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $14, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for adults is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for each child is $10, and there are 2 children, so the total cost for children is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two parks:
- The difference is \(76 - 48 = 28\) dollars.

So, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars by choosing the second amusement park over the first."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for a large button, so 27 small buttons = 27 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left and 40 + 27 = 67 large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 67 large stickers = 0.5 * 67 = 33.5, but since we can't have half a sticker, we'll assume she trades 33 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 33 large stickers = 33 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 67 - 33 = 34 large stickers left and 67 + 33 = 100 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 34 large stickers left, and each large sticker is worth three small buttons.
   - 34 large stickers = 34 * 3 = 102 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 102 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 102 small buttons and 100 large buttons.
   - The total number of buttons is 102 + 100 = 202.

So, by the end, Lorraine has 202 buttons."

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the students:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases of shingles for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles.

They have read a total of 600 books altogether."
"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5, making her total for Monday \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours remaining for video games and soccer.

Next, we calculate the time she spends playing video games, which is 1/3 of the remaining 9 hours:
1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours.

Now, we subtract the time spent on video games from the remaining time to find out how much time she spends playing soccer:
9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we divide the time spent on soccer by the total time and multiply by 100:
(6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%.

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

50%"
"Anthony had 50 pencils initially.

First, he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]
So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon.

Now, Anthony has:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]
pencils left.

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]
So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Finally, Anthony kept the remaining pencils:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends driving back, and the time he spends at the museum.

1. **Time to drive to the museum:**
   - Distance to the museum: 150 miles
   - Speed: 75 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

2. **Time to drive back:**
   - Distance back: 150 miles
   - Speed: 75 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

3. **Time spent at the museum:**
   - Time = 6 hours

4. **Total time gone from home:**
   - Time to drive to the museum + Time at the museum + Time to drive back = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours."
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need to assemble all the toys, we can calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars:
57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

For the motorcycles:
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles:
228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after he assembles all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels he has:

650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

276 wheels"

You have to pay $800."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike has 600 movies in total.
2. A third of the movies are in series, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
3. The cost for the series is $6 each, so the total cost for the series is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
4. The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
5. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older movies.
6. The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
7. The remaining movies are \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies, and these are normal movies.
8. The cost for the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs:
- Series movies: $1200
- Older movies: $800
- Normal movies: $2400

The total cost is \( 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the Llesis family, which is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

1. **Calculate the distance driven:**
   - They drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - Their average driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the distance driven is \(4.5 \times 50 = 225\) miles.

2. **Calculate the hiking speed:**
   - Their hiking speed is \(5\) miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \(\frac{50}{2} = 25\) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is \(25 - 5 = 20\) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the distance hiked:**
   - They hiked for \(1.5\) hours.
   - Their hiking speed was \(20\) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the distance hiked is \(1.5 \times 20 = 30\) miles.

4. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - The total distance is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked.
   - Therefore, the total distance is \(225 + 30 = 255\) miles.

The final numerical answer is:
255 miles."
"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \), the number of berries Emma collects as \( B_e \), and the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level as \( T_e \).

For Ava, the number of enemies she jumps on is \( E_e + 8 \), the number of berries she collects is \( B_e + 3 \), and the number of seconds left on the timer when she finishes the level is \( T_e + 4 \).

The points for each player can be calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{seconds left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_e = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 30(T_e + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 30T_e + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e + 215 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Score}_a - \text{Score}_e = (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e + 215) - (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e) \]
\[ \text{Score}_a - \text{Score}_e = 215 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The total cost of the four pizzas is $64.
2. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total.
3. We need to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, which cost the same amount.

First, we calculate the total cost of the other two pizzas by subtracting the cost of the two pizzas that are already known from the total cost:

\[ \text{Cost of the other two pizzas} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cost of the two known pizzas} \]
\[ \text{Cost of the other two pizzas} = 64 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of the other two pizzas} = 34 \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:

\[ \text{Cost of each of the other two pizzas} = \frac{34}{2} \]
\[ \text{Cost of each of the other two pizzas} = 17 \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we have the equation:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( O + W = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \)

First, let's simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( O + W = 17 \)
2. \( O - 2W = 5 \)

We can solve this system using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we'll multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( W \):
\[ 2O + 2W = 34 \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now, add the two equations:
\[ (2O + 2W) + (O - 2W) = 34 + 5 \]
\[ 3O = 39 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

Now substitute \( O = 13 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 13 + W = 17 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store. 

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy travels to work in a week.
2. Determine the amount of fuel used for this distance.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel used.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Andy travels to work in a week.**

Andy travels 5 miles one way to work, so the round trip is 10 miles. He does this from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days a week.

Total distance per week = 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week

**Step 2: Determine the amount of fuel used for this distance.**

Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon (MPG). This means for every 10 miles, he uses 1 gallon of fuel.

Fuel used per week = Total distance per week / Fuel efficiency
Fuel used per week = 50 miles/week / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons/week

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel used.**

The current price for regular gas is $3 per gallon.

Cost per week = Fuel used per week * Price per gallon
Cost per week = 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week on gas for his commute to work."
"Carrie was given 10 twenties and 140 quarters.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the trip.
2. Calculate the amount the school will cover.
3. Calculate the amount John still needs to raise.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school will cover half of this cost, so:

\[ \text{School's contribution} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

This means John needs to raise the other half of the cost:

\[ \text{John's contribution needed} = 300 - 150 = 150 \]

John currently has $50, so the amount he is still missing is:

\[ \text{Amount missing} = 150 - 50 = 100 \]

"First, let's determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Now, we need to find out how many degrees below 32 degrees the temperature is at night. Since the temperature at night is 12 degrees, we subtract 32 from 12:

12 degrees - 32 degrees = -20 degrees

This means the temperature is 20 degrees below 32 degrees. To prevent the pipes from freezing, Carson needs to raise the temperature by 20 degrees. Since each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. We do this by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups each brought back 2 seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells. We calculate this as follows:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

So, 6 groups each brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells brought back, we multiply the number of groups that brought seashells by the number of seashells each group brought:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the diamond and the gold.
2. Calculate the 30% premium on the total cost.
3. Add the premium to the total cost to get the final amount James paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the diamond and the gold.
The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300.
Total cost = $600 + $300 = $900

Step 2: Calculate the 30% premium on the total cost.
30% of $900 is calculated as:
0.30 * $900 = $270

Step 3: Add the premium to the total cost to get the final amount James paid.
Final amount = Total cost + Premium
Final amount = $900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, so it's 2 * (40/100) = 80/100 or 0.8. Therefore, 400 * 0.8 = 320 fifth-graders passed.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 680
- Total students: 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68 \]

Expressed as a percentage, the overall pass rate is 68%.

The final numerical answer is:

68%"
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with the total number of glass chips.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, we multiply:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by the number of chips per square inch:

\[ 144 \text{ chips} \div 12 \text{ chips/square inch} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we divide the total area by the height:

\[ 12 \text{ square inches} \div 3 \text{ inches} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and then add the remaining tea to find the initial amount.

1. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:
   - Each of the four students drank 1.5 quarts.
   - Total for four students: \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.

2. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the sixteen students:
   - Each of the sixteen students drank 2 quarts.
   - Total for sixteen students: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

3. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by all the students:
   - Total consumed: \(6 + 32 = 38\) quarts.

4. Add the remaining tea to the total consumed to find the initial amount:
   - Remaining tea: 10 quarts.
   - Initial amount: \(38 + 10 = 48\) quarts.

5. Convert the initial amount from quarts to gallons (1 gallon = 4 quarts):
   - Initial amount in gallons: \(48 \div 4 = 12\) gallons.

Final numerical answer:
12 gallons"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he sold more than he initially had. Then he ordered 100 more candies.

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has after ordering more and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

1. Total candies after ordering more: 100 (initial) + 100 (ordered) = 200 candies
2. Candies sold: 150

Now, subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies:

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 candies

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

50"
"Let's break down the problem month by month, starting with the beginning of the year.

- **Beginning of the year (January 1st):** There are 10 students.
- **End of January:** The number of students doubles, so there are \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students.
- **End of February:** The number of students doubles again, so there are \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students.
- **End of March:** The number of students doubles again, so there are \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students.
- **End of April:** The number of students doubles again, so there are \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students.
- **End of May:** The number of students doubles again, so there are \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students.

Now, we need to find out how many additional students have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

- Number of students at the beginning of the year: 10
- Number of students at the end of May: 320

The additional number of students is \(320 - 10 = 310\).

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Now, let's sum up all the petals she initially has:
\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

After picking all the flowers, she drops 1 of each type:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals lost is:
\(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

Subtract the lost petals from the total:
\(101 - 22 = 79\) petals

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:

"John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

Starting with 35 marshmallows, after making the S'mores and dropping some, the number of marshmallows left is 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows.

With 14 marshmallows left, and assuming they want to make an equal number of S'mores, each kid can have 14 / 2 = 7 S'mores.

Final numerical answer:
7 S'mores each."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Jack's Game Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Jack's total game time is 240 minutes.
   - The number of quarters Jack uses is \( \frac{240}{20} = 12 \) quarters.

2. **Friends' Game Times:**
   - Two friends can play half as long as Jack, so they can play for \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes per quarter.
   - The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes per quarter.
   - The total game time for the two friends who play half as long is \( \frac{240}{2} = 120 \) minutes.
   - The number of quarters each of these two friends uses is \( \frac{120}{10} = 12 \) quarters.
   - The total game time for the better friend is also 120 minutes.
   - The number of quarters the better friend uses is \( \frac{120}{30} = 4 \) quarters.

3. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack uses 12 quarters.
   - Each of the two friends who play half as long uses 12 quarters, so together they use \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) quarters.

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

Let the amount of salt used be \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.

According to the problem, the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express all the ingredients in terms of \( z \):
- Citrus zest: \( z \) ounces
- Fragrance: \( z \) ounces
- Salt: \( 2z \) ounces
- Sugar: \( 2z \) ounces
- Oil: \( 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \) ounces

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of all these ingredients, which is 10 ounces:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil used:
\[ \text{Oil} = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Robert has 20 cars.
2. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars:

3. 20% of Joe's cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother:

4. Twice the number of cars he sold is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

Now, let's calculate how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away:

5. Joe initially had 40 cars.
6. After selling 8 cars, he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars.
7. After giving away 16 cars, he has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars.

So, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund Milly will receive, then subtract the refund from the cost of the book.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - The total shipping cost is the sum of the cost per pound and the cost per mile.
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund Milly will receive:**
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund} = 75\% \times \$32 = 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The net loss is the cost of the book minus the refund, plus the shipping cost.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = \$32 - \$24 + \$3.00 = \$11.00

"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to add up the time she spends on each activity she mentioned.

1. **Recording Videos:**
   - Britany records 18 4-minute videos each week.
   - Total time spent recording videos per week = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - Total time spent recording videos per month = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Writing Songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Total time spent writing songs per month = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.

3. **Doing Makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Total time spent doing makeup per week = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.
   - Total time spent doing makeup per month = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, let's convert all the times to the same unit for easier addition. We'll use minutes for all calculations.

- Total time spent recording videos per month = 288 minutes.
- Total time spent writing songs per month = 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.
- Total time spent doing makeup per month = 360 minutes.

Adding these up:

Total time spent on TikTok in a month = 288 minutes (recording) + 480 minutes (writing) + 360 minutes (makeup) = 1128 minutes.

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the items she needs installed and compare them to the included items in the base price.

The base price includes:
- Hanging 4 mirrors
- Installing 2 shelves
- Installing 1 chandelier
- Hanging 10 pictures

Angela needs:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

First, let's calculate the additional mirrors and chandeliers:
- Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors
- Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier
- Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures

The cost for the additional items is $15.00 per item. So, we calculate the cost for the additional mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures:

- Cost for additional mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $30.00
- Cost for additional chandeliers: 1 chandelier * $15.00/chandelier = $15.00
- Cost for additional pictures: 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00

Now, we add these costs to the base price of $129.00:

Total cost = Base price + Cost for additional mirrors + Cost for additional chandeliers + Cost for additional pictures
Total cost = $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00
Total cost = $224.00

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in feet, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high (12 inches * 4).
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high (48 inches * 10).

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to cross the highway.

1. First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 3 \times 18 \]
Let's denote the speed of one kangaroo as \(v\). Then:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

2. Now, we need to find out how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same distance. The speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. The time \(T\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is given by:
\[ T = \frac{D}{\text{speed of one turtle} \times 4} = \frac{54v}{\frac{v}{2} \times 4} = \frac{54v}{2v} \times 4 = 27 \times 4 = 108 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take the four turtles 108 hours to cross the highway.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 this week and her mom gives her $80, so the total amount she has from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.
4. Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means the total amount she has now is $400 - $50 = $350.
5. To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we subtract the amount she has from her job and her mom from the total amount she has: $350 - $230 = $120.

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

The final numerical answer is:
$120"
"To find out how many apple slices are left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Adam has after slicing the apples.

Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Adam also slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
15 slices from large apples + 15 slices from small apples = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract the slices he ate from the total number of slices:
30 slices - 15 slices eaten = 15 slices left

Final numerical answer:
15"
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow. With 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of the glue that is left in each of the three glue sticks and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left. Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the length of the glue that is not used is:
   \[
   12 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{6}\right) = 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left. The length of the glue that is not used is:
   \[
   12 \times \left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) = 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left. The length of the glue that is not used is:
   \[
   12 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the lengths of the glue that is not used from all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[

"Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is a total of:

2 * $20 = $40

He spends $2 on each of the six squirt guns, so the total spent on squirt guns is:

6 * $2 = $12

He also spends $3 on each of the three packs of water balloons, so the total spent on water balloons is:

3 * $3 = $9

The total amount spent is the sum of the money spent on squirt guns and water balloons:

$12 + $9 = $21

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money he had:

$40 - $21 = $19

"Given:
- Jack collected 60 dishes.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has 30 socks (since 60 / 2 = 30).
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 60 socks (since 2 * 30 = 60).
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 30 dishes (since 60 / 2 = 30).

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) + 60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 180

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- 5 students are good at math only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we need to find out how many students are good at both subjects. We know there are 20 students in total and 8 of them perform well in English only. So, the number of students who are good at both subjects is:

20 (total students) - 5 (good at math only) - 8 (good at English only) = 7 students good at both math and English.

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add those who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

5 (good at math only) + 7 (good at both math and English) = 12 students good at math.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such time slots fit into the 2-hour concert duration, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group takes:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Now, let's convert the total concert duration into minutes:
- Total concert duration: 2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes

We also need to account for the 10-minute intermission. So, the total time available for the groups to perform is:
- Total time available for groups = 120 minutes (total duration) - 10 minutes (intermission) = 110 minutes

Now, we can determine how many groups can perform by dividing the total available time by the time each group takes:
- Number of groups = Total time available for groups / Time per group = 110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
11 groups can perform in the concert."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the annual interest rate.
2. Calculate the interest earned each year.
3. Sum the interest earned over the 3 years.
4. Add the total interest to the original investment to get the final amount.

The annual interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is $300. So, the annual interest rate is:

\[ \text{Annual Interest} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

Since the interest is simple, it will be the same each year. Over 3 years, the total interest earned will be:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Now, we add the total interest to the original investment to get the final amount:

\[ \text{Final Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total white shirts**: 40
2. **Total floral shirts**: 50

3. **White shirts with collars**: Half of the white shirts have collars, so:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ white shirts with collars}
   \]

4. **White shirts with no collars**: The remaining white shirts do not have collars, so:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ white shirts with no collars}
   \]

5. **Floral shirts with buttons**: 20 floral shirts have buttons.

6. **Floral shirts with no buttons**: The remaining floral shirts do not have buttons, so:
   \[
   50 - 20 = 30 \text{ floral shirts with no buttons}

"Mr. Smith initially has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, so he sold:
2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y

The number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:
45 + 25 = 70 goats

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - So, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so each basket of red food now costs \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
   - So, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
   - So, the total cost is \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."

"Let's denote your age as \( F \), your brother's age as \( B \), and your sister's age as \( S \).

From the information given, we can write the following equations:

1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( F = B - 3 \)
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( F = S + 2 \)
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \)
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( F + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \)

First, we can express \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( F \):

From equation 1: \( B = F + 3 \)
From equation 2: \( S = F - 2 \)

Now, substitute \( B \) and \( S \) into the sum of all ages equation:

\[ F + (F + 3) + (F - 2) + (3(F + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ F + F + 3 + F - 2 + 3F + 9 - 1 = 87 \]

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
- There are 27 students.
- Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
- Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Step 2: Determine how many packs are required.
- Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
- To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack and round up to the nearest whole number because Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he wants to have some extra glue sticks.
- 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.
- Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 7 packs.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."
"The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so the new amount is:

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Each infected person infects six others every day, so the number of infected people multiplies by 7 each day (since the original person is now infected and infects 6 others).

Let's break it down day by day:

- **Day 0 (initial):** 10 people are infected.
- **Day 1:** Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so \(10 \times 7 = 70\) people are infected.
- **Day 2:** Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others, so \(70 \times 7 = 490\) people are infected.
- **Day 3:** Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others, so \(490 \times 7 = 3430\) people are infected.

Therefore, after three days, the number of people infected is **3430**."

"Claire earns 1 badge every month. 

In a year, Claire would earn:
1 badge/month * 12 months/year = 12 badges/year

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same time Claire earns 1 badge, Amber earns 1/2 badge. Therefore, in a year, Amber would earn:
(1 badge/month / 2) * 12 months/year = 6 badges/year

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in a year, Wendy would earn:
3 * 12 badges/year = 36 badges/year

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract Amber's badges from Wendy's badges:
36 badges/year (Wendy) - 6 badges/year (Amber) = 30 badges

Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."

"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many boxes of jello are required.
3. Calculate the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

Greg wants each of the 30 kids to have 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are required.**

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Madeline pays per month.
2. Calculate the total amount Keenan pays per month.
3. Divide the monthly amount Keenan pays by 4 to find out how much he spends per week.

First, we know that Madeline pays 60% of the total cost of $400 per month. So, we calculate 60% of $400:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

This means Madeline pays $240 per month. Since the total cost is $400, the remaining amount that Keenan pays is:

\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \]

So, Keenan pays $160 per month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly amount by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month):

\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \]

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week."

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost for 16 bolts is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Step 2: Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.
David initially has $12.48, so after buying the bolts, he has:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we first need to determine her hourly rate of earning.

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. So, her hourly rate is:

\[ \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\$33}{3 \text{ hours}} = \$11 \text{ per hour} \]

Now, to find out how much she would earn after 12 hours, we multiply her hourly rate by 12:

\[ \text{Earnings after 12 hours} = \$11 \times 12 = \$132 \]

So, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking."
"Paul starts with 52 marbles and receives 28 more from his friend. So, he has:

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.

First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them:

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Next, we know that Isaias plans to sell these chickens at $50 each. So, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens he took to the market is the total revenue minus the profit:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for:

\[ \boxed{7000} \]"
"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses Mitchell sold.

The total number of glasses sold by Julie and the boys is 32, and Julie sold 14 glasses, so the boys together sold:
\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \text{ glasses} \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2 to find out how many each boy sold:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ glasses} \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. Iris spent $400 on her hair.
2. She spent 1/4 as much on a manicure, so the cost of the manicure is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
3. She spent 3/4 as much as the manicure on a pedicure, so the cost of the pedicure is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[
400 + 100 + 75 = 575

"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will make from selling the rope:

1. Sarah's rope is 20 meters long.
2. The selling price is $2 per meter.

So, the total amount of money Sarah will make is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:

1. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter.
2. Sarah plans to buy a rope of the same length, which is 20 meters.

So, the total cost of the new rope is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she made from selling the rope:
\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after she buys the new rope."
"Let's denote Melanie's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be 24 as \( y \). So, we can write the equation:
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12.

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

- Total cost of bacon: $10
- Total cost of chicken: $24
- Total cost of strawberries: $12
- Total cost of apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:

$65 - $60 = $5

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."
"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime is 65 minutes. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes."

"To find out how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange on the stage, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of microphones that won't find any space to fit in.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of microphones to find out how many microphones were actually paired.
3. Divide the number of paired microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs.

Let's start with step 1. We know that 20% of the 50 microphones won't find any space to fit in. So, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in.

Next, we move to step 2. We subtract the 10 microphones that won't fit from the total 50 microphones:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, 40 microphones were actually paired.

Finally, for step 3, we divide the 40 microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children.

Each child's bowl is half the size of an adult's bowl, so 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls (since 2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls).

Calvin has 8 child bowls in total, and after the adults have their bowls, there are 4 child bowls left.

Calvin has 2 children, and each child will get an equal share of the leftover soup. So, the 4 child bowls will be divided equally between the 2 children.

Each child will get:
4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 child bowls

Final numerical answer:
Each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup."

"To determine how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask separately and then sum the totals.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \(\frac{2}{4} = 0.5\) yards of material.
- To make 20 small masks, she would need \(20 \times 0.5 = 10\) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \(\frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75\) yards of material.
- To make 8 large masks, she would need \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles per tune-up:

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

3 tune-ups"
"Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

To find the total hours Bruce works in all these three days, we add the hours from each day:

5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours.

Therefore, Bruce works a total of 23 hours in these three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, we can calculate the cost for 12 balloons as follows:
   - Cost for 2 balloons = $0.5
   - Cost for 1 dozen (12 balloons) = $0.5 * (12 / 2) = $0.5 * 6 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each = $7 * 2 = $14

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each girl was given.

- Amount given to each girl = $28 / 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14."
"Kira initially bought:
- 3 apples
- 5 bananas
- 6 oranges

Total pieces of fruit Kira bought = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces

Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit.

So, the number of pieces left = 14 - 2 = 12 pieces

Final numerical answer:
12"
"To find the total number of students, we need to add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer.

1. There are 6 students playing tennis.
2. There are twice that number playing volleyball, which means there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) students playing volleyball.
3. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, which totals \(16 + 22 = 38\) students playing soccer.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

\[6 \text{ (tennis)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (soccer)} = 56\]

So, the total number of students is 56."
"To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Total number of lollipops sold = Number of students × Average lollipops sold per student
   = 30 students × 10 lollipops/student
   = 300 lollipops

2. Total revenue from selling the lollipops = Total number of lollipops sold × Selling price per lollypop
   = 300 lollipops × $0.8/lollypop
   = $240

3. Total cost of buying the lollipops = Total number of lollipops sold × Buying price per lollypop
   = 300 lollipops × $0.5/lollypop
   = $150

4. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   = $240 - $150
   = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\)

Therefore, Larry has 47 pets."
"Abby can eat 2 slices a day. Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, which means Josh can eat 4 slices a day.

Together, Abby and Josh can eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices.

To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they can eat together in a day:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days}
\]

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"Martha has been collecting shells for 5 years, starting from her 5th birthday. She collects one shell every month. There are 12 months in a year, so over 5 years, she would have collected:

"Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows, so each row has:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. This means that in each row, the 9 cups are split equally between chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

So, there are 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

Final numerical answer:
4.5"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Calculate the number of berries picked per trip.

First, we know that each trip takes 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick per trip to collect 24 berries in total. Since the sloth makes 2 trips, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The pool has 10,000 gallons of water, and they fill the tank with half of that amount:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

1. **Initial Budget**: $150
2. **Expenses so far**:
   - **Movies**: Colby has seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays and 8 movies on other days. Each movie ticket costs $10.
     - Cost for 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars
     - Cost for 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars
     - Total cost for movies: \(50 + 56 = 106\) dollars
   - **Popcorn**: Colby has had 2 tubs of popcorn, each costing $8.
     - Total cost for popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
   - **Candy**: Colby has had 4 boxes of candy, each costing $2.
     - Total cost for candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars
   - **Total expenses so far**: \(106 + 16 + 8 = 130\) dollars

3. **Remaining Budget**: \(150 - 130 = 20\) dollars

4. **Current Day**: It's a Friday, so the movie ticket costs $10. Colby also wants to buy popcorn and a box of candy.
   - Cost for popcorn: $8
   - Cost for a box of candy: $2
   - Total cost for popcorn and candy: \(8 + 2 = 10\) dollars

5. **Remaining Budget after current day expenses**: \(20 - 10 = 10\) dollars

6. **Number of movies he can see with the remaining budget**: Since each movie ticket costs $10, with $10 remaining, he can see 1 more movie.

**Final Answer**: Colby can see 1 more movie."
"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
3. Calculate the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Calculate the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, the mini cinnamon roll has:
   \[
   \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, the mini blueberry muffin has:
   \[
   \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:
   \[
   200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:
   \[
   300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories}
   \]

5. Adding the total calories from both types of pastries gives:
   \[
   40000 + 45000 = 85000 \text{ calories}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[
\boxed{85000}

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so:
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)

On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Adding these together:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 300\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[\frac{300}{5} = 60\]

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
The total number of toys is 62.

Let's add up the known quantities:

31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of toys:

62 (total toys) - 48 (known toys) = 14

So, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 4 + 1 (Maria) = 5 people in total.
2. Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons.
3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
4. Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 balloons.

Now, let's add them all up:

- Initial balloons given to friends: 8
- Balloons Maria had: 1
- Additional balloons given by her mom: 15

Total balloons = 8 + 1 + 15 = 24

The total number of balloons the girls had is 24."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and the boxes they already have:

- 10 people donate 5 boxes each: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes
- They already have 10 boxes

So, the total number of boxes is \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes, given that each table can fit 2 boxes:

- Total boxes / Boxes per table = \(60 / 2 = 30\) tables

They already own 15 tables, so we need to find out how many new tables they need:

- New tables needed = Total tables required - Tables they already have
- New tables needed = \(30 - 15 = 15\)

Therefore, they need 15 new tables.

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney: \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Now, we find the average of these two totals:
- Total distance spat by both: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet
- Average total distance spat: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets produced by each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

Let's start with the Widgeteer 3000:

1. Widgets produced per hour: 60
2. Hours per day: 24
3. Days in a month: 30

Widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43,200 \text{ widgets} \]

Revenue from selling the widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43,200 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259,200 \]

Now, let's calculate for the WidgetMaster 9000:

1. Widgets produced per hour: 45
2. Hours per day: 24
3. Days in a month: 30

Widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
\[ 45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32,400 \text{ widgets} \]

Revenue from selling the widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32,400 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194,400 \]

Finally, we find the difference in revenue between the two machines:
\[ \$259,200 - \$194,400 = \$64,800 \]

Therefore, Fern will make \(\$64,800\) more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for 17 hours.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for 24 hours:
- The cost for 24 hours is 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the first 12 hours and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour:
- The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays for 17 hours, so he has 5 additional hours beyond the initial 12 hours.
- The cost for the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.

So, the total cost for the 17-hour stay with the additional hourly charge is:
- 1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's find out how much Cameron would save by choosing the 17-hour option over the 24-hour option:
- The cost for 24 hours is 1600 pesos.
- The cost for 17 hours with the additional hourly charge is 1350 pesos.

The savings would be:
- 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is 10 pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.

For the goats:
15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds

For the sheep:
12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

Total hay needed:
75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week:

John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he deposits $100 in the bank:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from his remaining money:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

300 letters + 50 letters = 350 letters

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add Craig's total to his brother's total:

300 letters + 350 letters = 650 letters

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 650."
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

Each row has 8 children, and there are 7 rows per school. Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of rows is:

\[ 7 \text{ rows/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 35 \text{ rows} \]

Now, since each row has 8 children, the total number of children is:

\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 35 \text{ rows} = 280 \text{ children} \]

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons:

Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, and the teacher has 9 coupons. So, the total number of bottles from coupons is:
\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles the teacher has for herself:

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to add the visit charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

1. Visit charge: $40
2. Labor charge: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). So, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. Parts charge: $60

Now, we add these charges together:

$40 (visit charge) + $105 (labor charge) + $60 (parts charge) = $205

Therefore, Patty charged $205 for the job."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, let's apply the 40% discount:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

$150 - $60 = $90

Next, James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

Now, we need to calculate how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. We subtract the money he got from selling the CDs from the total cost he paid for all 10 CDs:

$90 - $200 = -$110

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $110, not that he was out money. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

$110"
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, we add up the totals:

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the distance James swims.
2. Determine the time it takes to swim that distance.
3. Calculate the rest time.
4. Determine the time it takes to swim the remaining distance at the reduced speed.
5. Sum up all the times to get the total time.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Distance James swims:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Time to swim the distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Time to swim the remaining distance:**
   James swims the remaining distance at half the original speed, which is 1 mile per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Total time:**
   Sum up all the times.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many loaves Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result to find the number of loaves the bakery has.

Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate:

1. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had: \(7 \times 70 = 490\)
2. Subtract 40 from 490: \(490 - 40 = 450\)

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total commission.

Let's start with the New York Times:

- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission from the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \text{ copies} \times \$5 \text{ per copy} \times 10\% = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = \$3 \]

Now, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:

- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \text{ copies} \times \$15 \text{ per copy} \times 8\% = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = \$12 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts to get the total commission:

\[ \$3 + \$12 = \$15 \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \$15 \]"
"Deanna is 26 years old.

Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, so Leo’s age is:
21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From equation 2, we have \( A = B - 20 \).
- From equation 3, we have \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
- \( A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \)
- \( D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \)

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

The final numerical answer is:

"The book is 1.5 inches thick, and there are 100 pages per inch of thickness. Since each paper is printed on both sides, one inch of thickness corresponds to 200 pages (100 pages per side).

To find the total number of pages in the book, we multiply the thickness in inches by the number of pages per inch:

1.5 inches * 200 pages/inch = 300 pages

Therefore, the book has 300 pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Multiply the number of 15-minute intervals by the number of reports Vince can staple in each interval.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert 15 hours into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. Kim's usual sleep schedule is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours or 480 minutes.
2. On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her wake-up time was 5:55 a.m.
3. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.
4. She was awake for 5 minutes before her usual wake-up time, so she was awake from 5:50 a.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is 5 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time she was asleep:

- Usual sleep time: 480 minutes
- Subtract the time she was sleepwalking: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes
- Subtract the time she was awake before her usual wake-up time: 457 - 5 = 452 minutes

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen cups, which is 24 cups.

First, we calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Number of measuring spoons remaining} \]
\[ \text{Total utensils} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Number of unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200.
   - New admissions = 700.
   - Total occupied beds = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds = 900.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family, so the number of emails to family is:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

The other emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend, so the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

(1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

1 email/day"
"If Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

3 * 3 = 9 years old.

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, Shawna's father is:

5 * 9 = 45 years old.

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney reported 48 people and Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%, we can calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%). So, we can write the equation as:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey would have carried 1 ball (since Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey), and Jordan would have carried 4 balls (twice as many as Jason). Therefore, the total number of balls would be:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Since the total number of balls is the same as \( 7J \), we can set up the equation:
\[ 7J = 7 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried 4 balls. The total number of balls is:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's first calculate the total number of holes dug and filled in by the end of the third day.

- First day: 10 holes dug
- Second day: 13 holes dug
- Third day: 8 holes dug, but 2 holes were filled in

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 8 (third day) = 31 holes dug

The number of holes filled in by the end of the third day is 2.

Therefore, the net number of holes by the end of the third day is:
31 (holes dug) - 2 (holes filled) = 29 holes

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes dug. So, the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
4 * 10 = 40 holes

To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes by the end of the third day from the number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
40 (holes by the end of the fourth day) - 29 (holes by the end of the third day) = 11 holes

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey, so:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:

"To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
2. Calculate the total cost of the travel tickets, which is 50% more than the supplies.
3. Add the cost of the supplies and the travel tickets to get the total travel cost.

Let's start with the cost of the supplies, which is $400.

Next, we calculate the cost of the travel tickets. Since the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to find 50% of $400 and add it to the original $400.

50% of $400 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies and the travel tickets to get the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the total travel cost is:
\[ \boxed{1000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation above:
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokemon."
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes in total.

10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

John will spend 200 minutes watching the show."
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance she flew in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_3 = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

The total distance flown south is the sum of the first and third distances:
\[
\text{Total Southward Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_3 = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]

The total distance flown north is the second distance:
\[
\text{Total Northward Distance} = \text{Distance}_2 = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the difference between the total southward distance and the total northward distance:
\[
\text{Net Distance} = \text{Total Southward Distance} - \text{Total Northward Distance} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}

"Greta initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

When she arrived home, she had 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

So, before the surprise party, Greta had a total of:
12 (initial batch) + 6 (office party) + 48 (surprise party) = 66 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Therefore, the number of brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
66 (total brownies) - 18 (brownies eaten) = 48 brownies.

Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice his age, so his brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Now, we add up the total time:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all of the racquets."
"John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the last 2 phones is:
2 * $300 = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the last 2 phones together, we get the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid $1800 for all the phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. 

Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To calculate the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to determine the perimeter of the rectangular fence.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. 

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which means she kept:
8 boxes * 1/4 = 2 boxes

Therefore, the number of boxes she sold is:
8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges

Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. If we add up the cherries that Robert and Richard have, we get \(30 + 20 = 50\) cherries.
4. Since the total number of cherries is 60, the number of cherries Jerry has is \(60 - 50 = 10\).

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, so the difference is \(30 - 10 = 20\).

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"Let's break down the sales for each day and then calculate the total earnings.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 10 boxes
- Apple pie sold: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday, so we need to find out how many boxes were sold on Sunday first.

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 5 more boxes than on Saturday, so that's 10 + 5 = 15 boxes.
- Apple pie sold: 15 boxes.

Now, we can find out how many boxes of apple pie were sold on Saturday:
- Apple pie sold on Saturday: 15 (Sunday) - 4 = 11 boxes.

**Total sales for each day:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread and 11 boxes of apple pie.
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

**Calculating earnings:**
- Gingerbread cost: $6 per box
- Apple pie cost: $15 per box

**Saturday earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
- Apple pie: 11 boxes * $15 = $165
- Total for Saturday: $60 + $165 = $225

**Sunday earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
- Apple pie: 15 boxes * $15 = $225
- Total for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

**Total earnings for two days:**
- Saturday + Sunday: $225 + $315 = $540

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

First, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price:
40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
$100 - $40 = $60

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:

3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.

Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years, so his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

Similarly, his brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Now, we need to find out how many students are left after removing the football players:

30 - 6 = 24 students

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So, we calculate:

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

These 6 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find out how many students are leaving early:

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students

So, 12 students are leaving early."
"If Sophie wears size 5 boots, then Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, which means Charlie wears size 5 * 5 = size 25 boots.

To find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add their sizes together and divide by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To determine how many additional plants Pat needs to fill her flower bed, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them.

Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot. Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

1 foot (for the plant) + 1.5 feet (space between plants) = 2.5 feet

Now, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed:

111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4 plants

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 plants, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:

44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

27 plants * $6 per plant = $162

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, so his brother eats:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels a day} \]

In a week, there are 7 days, so his brother eats:

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels in a week} \]

Final numerical answer:
63"
"To find out how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply it by 5.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket will have 3 petunias, and each petunia costs $3.00.
- Each basket will have 2 sweet potato vines, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The cost for the petunias in one basket is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

The cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per sweet potato vine} = \$5.00 \]

The total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00 \]

So, Katherine will spend:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then subtract that from the total amount of soil they have.

First, let's calculate the soil needed for the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They plant 4 sunflowers.

Soil for sunflowers = 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Next, let's calculate the soil needed for the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They plant 10 carnations.

Soil for carnations = 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
Total soil used = Soil for sunflowers + Soil for carnations
Total soil used = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil, so the remaining soil is:
Remaining soil = Total soil - Soil used
Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
Number of roses = Remaining soil / Soil per rose
Number of roses = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

Final numerical answer:
3"
"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as:
\[ 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

The number of pairs of shoes she can buy each month is:
\[ \frac{500}{1000} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs, which means she can buy 0 pairs in a month.

Now, we need to calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year. Since she can buy 0 pairs each month, in a year she can buy:
\[ 0 \times 12 = 0 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and sauté the shrimp:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. The air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling on low: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. The air conditioner is then turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling on high: \(4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ degrees/hour} = 12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. After that, the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours, and the room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 4 \text{ degrees}\)

4. Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
   - Net cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\)
   - Net warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\)
   - Net change in temperature: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\)

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Final answer:
14 degrees"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet.

First, we need to determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet for the first time. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, we can use this information to find out when Bill saw the Comet for the second time.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the second time Bill saw the Comet would be 75 years after his dad saw it. So, if Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, Bill would have seen it 75 years later.

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the second time. According to the problem, Bill was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet for the first time. So, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.

Since the Comet orbits every 75 years, the time between the first and second sighting for Bill is 75 years. Therefore, to find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time, we subtract 75 years from 90 years.

So, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider each type of check and how often he writes them.

1. Electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Church: 2 checks per month
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check every quarter (4 months)

First, we calculate the number of checks for the monthly bills:
- Electric bill: 12 checks per year (1 check/month * 12 months)
- Gas bill: 12 checks per year (1 check/month * 12 months)
- Church: 24 checks per year (2 checks/month * 12 months)

Next, we calculate the number of checks for the pest and lawn service:
- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (1 check/quarter * 4 quarters)

Now, we add all the checks together:
- Electric bill: 12 checks
- Gas bill: 12 checks
- Church: 24 checks
- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks

Total checks per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks

Therefore, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips.
2. The second plane's 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips in one day.

Now, let's analyze the first plane's flights:

- The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
- The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.

So, the first plane makes 88 trips in total. Three-quarters of these trips are to Greece, which is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

This means the remaining flights are:
\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]

These 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day."
"Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute).

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(120 / 60 = 2\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the information given:

- Adam's mother gave him $6.
- Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
- The total cost of the trousers is $30.

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to add the amounts given by his mother and father and then subtract this total from the cost of the trousers.

So, the total amount given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.

Now, subtract this from the cost of the trousers: \(30 - 18 = 12\).

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( A = 3 \) (Akbar's age)
2. \( B = 4 \) (Alessandro's age)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age equation as:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, the average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

So, the age of Wilfred is \( \boxed{3} \)."
"Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund, which totals:

$500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend then gives him $200, so the total amount collected before the lawyer's contribution is:

$2000 + $200 = $2200

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else donated $2200, the lawyer's contribution will be:

3 * $2200 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception:

100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door:

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church next door by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

So, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we need to divide the size of one adult's slice by the total size of the watermelon and then multiply by 100.

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the nine hours he has available.

1. Time spent at the clinic: 9 hours
2. Time spent on inpatients: 10 minutes per inpatient * 9 inpatients = 90 minutes = 1.5 hours
3. Time spent on appointments: 30 minutes per appointment * 10 appointments = 300 minutes = 5 hours

Now, we add up the time spent on inpatients and appointments:
1.5 hours (inpatients) + 5 hours (appointments) = 6.5 hours

Finally, we subtract the total time spent on inpatients and appointments from the 9 hours available:
9 hours - 6.5 hours = 2.5 hours

So, Doctor Jones will have 2.5 hours left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.

Now, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

Let's start with the cost per session for the studio:

- The studio rental cost per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- There are 10 students.

So, the total cost per session is:
\[ 25 + (1.50 \times 10) = 25 + 15 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:

- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- The total cost per session is $40.

So, the total cost per day is:
\[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:

- There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

So, the total cost per week is:
\[ 120 \times 4 = 480 \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:

- There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

So, the total cost per month is:
\[ 480 \times 4 = 1920 \]

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:
\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars, so:
\[ 4p = 64 \]

2. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars, so:
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, we solve for \( p \) and \( m \):

\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:

\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
4. Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the number of baby porcupines born each month is:
   \[
   \text{Number of baby porcupines per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

3. To find the total number of baby porcupines born in a year, we multiply the number of baby porcupines born each month by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
   \[
   \text{Number of baby porcupines in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

4. Finally, we add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population:
   \[
   \text{Final population} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

So, the number of porcupines in the park after a year is 1490."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the final cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

So, the total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed: 55 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_Matteo = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed: 45 miles per hour
- Time: 10 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_Shandy = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy:

Distance_Shandy - Distance_Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled:**
   - Total water filled in two days = \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

4. **Water Remaining:**
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water remaining = \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

**Final Answer:**
6000 gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501678 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501678} \approx 0.558 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 55.8%. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{55.8\%} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for a down payment on a $10,000 car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save that amount.

First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = (10 + 15) \times 40 = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much she wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car:

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000. Since she earns $1000 per week, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

So, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. 

Final numerical answer:
3"
"First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

Total packs = 15
Sweets per pack = 60

Total sweets = Total packs × Sweets per pack
Total sweets = 15 × 60
Total sweets = 900

Anne kept two packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

Packs given to friends = Total packs - Packs kept
Packs given to friends = 15 - 2
Packs given to friends = 13

Now, we need to find out how many sweets were in those 13 packs:

Sweets given to friends = Packs given to friends × Sweets per pack
Sweets given to friends = 13 × 60
Sweets given to friends = 780

Anne gave these 780 sweets equally to her 10 friends, so the number of sweets each friend received is:

Sweets per friend = Sweets given to friends ÷ Number of friends
Sweets per friend = 780 ÷ 10
Sweets per friend = 78

Each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this case is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total and divided them equally into 8 albums. So, each album contains:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ pictures} \]

Out of these 8 albums, 3 albums contain only selfies and 2 albums contain only portraits. This means there are 3 albums of selfies and 2 albums of portraits, which makes a total of 5 albums that are either selfies or portraits. The remaining 3 albums are not specified, but we don't need to know what's in them to answer the question.

Since each of the 2 portrait albums contains 9 pictures, the total number of portraits is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

And since each of the 3 selfie albums contains 9 pictures, the total number of selfies is:

\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

So, the total number of portraits and selfies is:

\[ 18 + 27 = 45 \]

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24.
3. 15 guests elected a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is 30 guests who checked in.
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

- Initial number of guests: 100
- Guests after early checkout: 100 - 24 = 76
- Guests after late checkout: 76 - 15 = 61
- Guests after afternoon check-in: 61 + 30 = 91
- Guests after dinner check-in: 91 + 7 = 98

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is 98."

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) because she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{Number of small stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of a small stuffed animal}) + (\text{Number of large stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of a large stuffed animal}) \]
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \) small stuffed animals.

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals she sold is 12."
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the daily total and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, to find the weekly total, we multiply the daily total by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches per week.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.
2. Then, we'll calculate how much ore 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in one day.
3. Finally, we'll find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days.

Step 1: Ore mined per day with a steel pickaxe
- With an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
- With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe.
- 50% of 12 pounds is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) pounds.
- Therefore, with a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine \(12 + 6 = 18\) pounds of ore per day.

Step 2: Ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day
- If one dwarf can mine 18 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, then 40 dwarves can mine \(40 \times 18 = 720\) pounds of ore per day.

Step 3: Ore mined by 40 dwarves in a month with 30 days
- If 40 dwarves can mine 720 pounds of ore per day, then in 30 days, they can mine \(720 \times 30 = 21600\) pounds of ore.

Final numerical answer:
21600 pounds of ore"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3.
- Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50.

Next, let's find the price per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6.
- Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost of the package with 8 sandwiches = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12.

The final numerical answer is:
$12."

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. There's a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. In this case, he doesn't have to turn in his homework.
2. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. In this case, he doesn't have to turn in his homework.
3. If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. In this case, he doesn't have to turn in his homework.

The only scenario where Marcus has to turn in his homework is if the normal teacher comes in, she doesn't give an extension, and he doesn't get a personal extension. Let's calculate the probability of this scenario:

- The probability that the normal teacher comes in is 60% (100% - 50%).
- Given that the normal teacher comes in, the probability that she doesn't give an extension is 60% (100% - 40%).
- Given that the normal teacher doesn't give an extension, the probability that Marcus doesn't get a personal extension is 80% (100% - 20%).

The combined probability of all these events happening is:
\[ 0.60 \times 0.60 \times 0.80 = 0.288 \]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[ 0.288 \times 100 = 28.8\% \]

Final answer:

"To determine how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it takes to place all the soda bottles and drop the candy.

First, we calculate the number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard places a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between bottles is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ intervals} \]

Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time it takes to place all the bottles and drop the candy. Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is:

\[ 8 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total amount of money he would have earned if he had continued working, and then determine how long it would take for him to earn an equivalent amount of money after graduating.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had continued working:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - He would have worked for 4 years without going to college.
   - Total amount earned without college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned with a college degree:**
   - His income after graduating is tripled, so his new annual income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.
   - We need to account for the 4 years he spent in college, during which he did not earn any money.
   - Total amount earned with college = $75,000 * (4 + x), where x is the number of years it takes to earn the equivalent of the loans and lost income.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim lost from not working while in school:**
   - Total lost income = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

5. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and lost income:**
   - Total amount needed = Total amount borrowed + Total lost income = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

6. **Determine how long it would take to earn the total amount needed:**
   - We need to find x such that $75,000 * (4 + x) = $300,000.
   - $75,000 * (4 + x) = $300,000
   - 4 + x = $300,000 / $75,000
   - 4 + x = 4
   - x = 4 - 4
   - x = 0

So, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

**Final Answer:**
4 years"
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the required fabric pieces. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

The length of the fabric pieces will be:
6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet

The width of the fabric pieces will be:
8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
Area = length × width
Area = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
Total area = 80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

2. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. So, we first find one-fifth of Monday's deliveries:
   \[
   \frac{425}{5} = 85
   \]
   Then, we add 17 to this number:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102

   So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. First, we find twice the number of Tuesday's deliveries:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this number:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209

$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net loss: $21.5 - $11 = $10.5

To find the average loss, we need to divide the total loss by the number of races (3):

Average loss: \(\frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5\)

So, Johnny's dad lost on average $3.5 per race that day."
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America.
2. Calculate the total number of people living in these cities.

Step 1: Number of cities in South America
There are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities. Therefore, the total number of cities is:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Step 2: Total number of people
Each city has 1000 people living in it. Therefore, the total population is:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 130,000 \]"
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert Xavier's initial height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth over the summer:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420.

Final numerical answer:
420"
"To calculate the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Calculate the total fraction of a day worked per day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Multiply the total hours worked per day by the number of days to get the total hours worked over the 3 weeks.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The team worked for 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of days is:
   \[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

2. The painters worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.

3. To convert \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day to hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):
   \[ \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9 \text{ hours per day} \]

4. Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the total number of days:
   \[ 9 \times 21 = 189 \text{ hours} \]

5. Finally, we divide the total hours by the number of painters (4) to find out how many hours each painter worked:
   \[ \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours} \]

So, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:

\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

\[
2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[
2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} + 2 \cdot 4 = 2 \cdot 19
\]

\[
4x + x + 8 = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:

\[ \text{Value after depreciation} = \text{Initial value} \times (1 - \text{depreciation rate})^{\text{number of years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

Plugging in the values, we get:

\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"To find the number of Spanish books, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 50 books in total.
2. Half of them are written in English, so there are \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) English books.
3. 10% of the books are written in German, so there are \( 50 \times \frac{10}{100} = 5 \) German books.

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \]

So, there are 20 Spanish books.

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

Total distance from San Diego to New York City: 1955 kilometers
Distance driven in 4 days: 325 kilometers

Distance remaining to be driven = Total distance - Distance already driven
Distance remaining to be driven = 1955 kilometers - 325 kilometers
Distance remaining to be driven = 1630 kilometers

Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[

"To calculate the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to determine how many tiles you will need and then multiply that by the cost per tile.

1. **Determine the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, you will need \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200\) tiles.

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

**Final Answer:**
The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new tiles will be $2400."
"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%.

To find the increased amount, we calculate 60% of $120:

\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is $72. Now, we add this to the normal monthly cost to find the total monthly cost after the accident:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the total cost for a year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet per week. 

- For the twin beds: 4 sheets per bed * 4 beds = 16 twin sheets per week.
- For the king bed: 1 king sheet per week.

Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time, we can calculate the number of loads per week:

- Twin sheets: 16 sheets / 2 sheets per load = 8 loads for the twin sheets.
- King sheets: 1 sheet / 1 sheet per load = 1 load for the king sheet.

So, Greg does 8 + 1 = 9 loads of laundry per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is:

9 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 468 loads/year.

Therefore, Greg does 468 loads of laundry in a year."
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous amount) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means:
2 * 50 (collected last year) = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by Imma's cats in one day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the daily consumption of cat food for one cat:
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams twice a day.
   - So, one cat consumes \(60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

2. Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption for all the cats is:
   - \(120 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
   - \(720 \, \text{grams} \div 360 \, \text{grams/day} = 2 \, \text{days}\).

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to Donovan's time:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, let's break down the charges:

1. Cast: $200
2. Doctor's visit: $300/hour for 30 minutes (which is half an hour, so the charge would be half of $300)
3. Painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills
4. Parking: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours

Now, let's calculate each:

1. Cast: $200
2. Doctor's visit: $300 * 0.5 = $150
3. Painkillers: $4 * 30 = $120
4. Parking: $6 * 2 = $12

Adding these up:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, that means 80% of the emails do require a response.

80% of 80 emails is calculated as follows:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day. 

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\]

First, add 32 and 64:

\[32 + 64 = 96\]

Next, add 96 and 96:

\[96 + 96 = 192\]

Then, add 30:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate:
   - The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.
   - 70% of 20 is \( 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \) pizzas.

2. Next, calculate how many pizzas the glee club has left:
   - The glee club started with 20 pizzas and ate 14, so they have \( 20 - 14 = 6 \) pizzas left.

3. Now, calculate how many pizzas the football team ordered:
   - The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) pizzas.

4. Then, calculate how many pizzas the football team ate:
   - The football team ate 80% of the 40 pizzas they ordered.
   - 80% of 40 is \( 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \) pizzas.

5. Next, calculate how many pizzas the football team has left:
   - The football team started with 40 pizzas and ate 32, so they have \( 40 - 32 = 8 \) pizzas left.

6. Finally, add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
   - The glee club has 6 pizzas left and the football team has 8 pizzas left.

"Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. 

First, let's calculate the number of big coupons:
\[ \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
\[ \text{Cost of small coupons} = 700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:
\[ \text{Cost of big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants, so he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets a second pound at half the price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. So, for the first pound, he pays $4.00, and for the second pound, he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Therefore, for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since he needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

6 pounds of butter / 2 pounds per set = 3 sets

3 sets * $6.00 per set = $18.00

The final cost for 6 pounds of butter is $18.00."
"To calculate the total cost of the party, we need to determine the number of guests and then apply the cost structure.

First, let's find out how many guests Kayla actually has:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- In total, she invited 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people.

However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

The cost structure is as follows:
- A flat fee of $125 for the first 20 guests.
- An additional $6 for each guest above 20.

So, the number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

Adding the flat fee to the cost of the additional guests gives us the total cost:
$125 + $126 = $251.

Therefore, the total cost of the party is $251."
"Let's start by calculating how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80.

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them has left:

Maggie has $60 left.
Riza has $60 left.

To find the total amount of money they have left together, we add their remaining amounts:

1. First, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a week.
2. Then, we can determine how many bananas the second monkey eats each day.
3. Finally, we can calculate how many bananas the third monkey eats each day.

Let's start with the total number of bananas and the number of days in a week:
- Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas.
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, the total number of bananas per day is:
\[ \frac{315 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Now, let's find out how many bananas each of the first two monkeys eat each day:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas} + 4 \text{ bananas} = 14 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Next, we can calculate how many bananas the third monkey eats each day by subtracting the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten per day:
\[ 45 \text{ bananas per day} - 10 \text{ bananas per day} - 14 \text{ bananas per day} = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

So, the third monkey eats:

\[ \text{Change} = 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \div 0.25 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters."
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price and then add all the amounts together.

1. Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.00
2. Burger platters: 9 platters * $11 each = $99.00
3. Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.00

Now, we add all the amounts together:

$33.00 (milkshakes) + $99.00 (burger platters) + $30.00 (sodas) = $162.00

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul boards the fourth train and the time he arrives at the station.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 minutes arrival + 20 minutes stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the first train's stay time, which is 5 minutes (20 minutes / 4).
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 minutes arrival + 5 minutes stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at time 0, he will wait 145 minutes for his train.

**Final Answer:**
145 minutes"
"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has already saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number required:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the 200 toothpicks she needs for the sculpture."
"To find the final numerical answer, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Original Price of the Watch**: $2000

2. **Price Mr. Rogers Paid**: Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers Paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
   \]

3. **Price Mr. Rogers Sold the Watch**: Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers Sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
   \]

4. **Percentage Discount for Mr. Rogers' Friend**: The friend bought the watch at $1800, which is 90% of the original price (since 1800 is 90% of 2000).
   \[
   \text{Percentage Discount} = \left(1 - \frac{1800}{2000}\right) \times 100 = (1 - 0.9) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, one spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

72,000"
"Frankie's score was 15 better than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score was 90.

Twice Binkie's score is \(2 \times 90 = 180\).

Frankie's score is 15 more than this, so Frankie's score is \(180 + 15 = 195\).

Frankie's score: 195"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James's home is 4 miles from the store.
2. He walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
3. He then walks back home, which is another 2 miles.
4. He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

First, we calculate the total distance James walked:
- Distance to halfway point: 2 miles
- Distance back home: 2 miles
- Total distance: 2 + 2 = 4 miles

Next, we calculate the time it took him to walk this distance:
- Speed: 4 miles per hour
- Distance: 4 miles
- Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the store."
"To calculate how much money Jenny saved, we need to compare the cost of buying 40 bananas (10 bunches, with 4 bananas per bunch) in bunches versus buying them individually.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 bananas individually:
- Each banana costs $0.80.
- Therefore, the cost for 40 bananas is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Therefore, the cost for 10 bunches is \(10 \times 3.00 = 30\) dollars.

Now, we can find the savings by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + H = 100 \)
2. \( H = S + 60 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine the growth rate per year and then apply it to the 13-year period.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the annual growth rate by 13:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Trekking bikes: 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
   - BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
   - MTB bikes: The rest, which is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

2. **Calculate the earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Price of an MTB: $500
   - Price of a BMX: $500 / 2 = $250
   - Price of a Trekking bike: $450

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

4. **Sum up the earnings:**
   - Total earnings = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

**Final Answer:**
Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"The farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales made is:

5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales picked up is:

3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

To find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made:

30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in classes each day is:
\[ 8 \times 40 = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:
\[ 320 \times 5 = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time he spends on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on these days. First, we find \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time:
\[ \frac{1600}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:
\[ 100 \times 2 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time:
\[ 1600 + 200 = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1800}{60} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, after the first bounce, the height will be:
\[ 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

After the second bounce, the height will be:
\[ 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 10.67 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\frac{32}{3}\) feet.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\frac{32}{3} \text{ feet}
\]"
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial weight of the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls to find the total area to be painted:

\[160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon:

\[240 \div 20 = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

Finally, we calculate the cost. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:

\[12 \times 12 = 144\]

So, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"Let's break down the scenario step by step:

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
2. She shakes 3 of them.
3. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas.
4. Her brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and picks a soda at random. There are 9 sodas left, and 2 of them are shaken.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second train is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour. 

To find out how far apart they are after 3 hours, we calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

For the first train:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles

For the second train:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance between the two trains:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

After 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps based on his working hours.

Let's start with step 1:

- March has 31 days, and Billy works from March 1st to March 31st, which is 31 days.
- April has 19 days, and Billy works from April 1st to April 19th, which is 19 days.
- Therefore, the total number of days is 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

Now, for step 2:

- Billy takes 20% of the days off, so he works 80% of the days.
- 80% of 50 days is 0.80 * 50 = 40 days.

For step 3:

- Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- Therefore, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.
- Over 40 days, he helps 6 * 40 = 240 people.

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time for the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time for the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."

"Let's break down the transactions step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract that from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is: $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is: $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   - She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - 40% of $100,000 is \(0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000\).

2. Calculate the total amount of money needed for 20 years of retirement:
   - She needs $40,000 per year for 20 years.
   - Total amount needed = \(40,000 \times 20 = 800,000\).

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:
   - She saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   - 20% of $100,000 is \(0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000\).

4. Calculate the number of years needed to save $800,000:
   - She saves $20,000 per year.
   - Number of years needed = \(\frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40\).

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement."
"Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut it into 4 equal parts, and then each of those parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts.

First, we find the length of each of the 4 equal parts:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

Next, we take each of these 25 cm parts and divide them into 5 equal parts:
\[ \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total school population, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total school population by \( P \).

Given that 40% of \( P \) is 240, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in the month of June, Soledad needs to determine how many miles she must hike per day.

First, we need to know the number of days in June, which is 30 days.

Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total distance she plans to cover each day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/walk} \times 2 \text{ walks/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles she needs to hike per day to cover 9,300 miles in 30 days. We do this by dividing the total distance by the number of days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 310 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we subtract the distance she plans to hike from the distance she needs to hike:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \]"
"To find out how much the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the revenue from red balls:
   - Number of red balls: 3

   - Total revenue from red balls: \(3 \times 9 = 27\)

2. Calculate the revenue from blue balls:
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Total revenue from blue balls: \(11 \times 5 = 55\)

3. Calculate the revenue from green balls:
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Total revenue from green balls: \(25 \times 3 = 75\)

4. Sum the revenues from all the balls:
   - Total revenue: \(27 + 55 + 75 = 157\)

The store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) after all the balls are sold."
"Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total.

Pierre wants a quarter of that, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of that, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

So, James will have:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

James will have 5 kilograms of apples left."
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped 8 degrees, so:

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we add the money he saved to his initial amount:
$21 + $11 = $32

Next, we subtract the cost of the comic book:
$32 - $5 = $27

Finally, we subtract the cost of the puzzle:
$27 - $19 = $8

So, Raymond has $8 left.

**Final Answer: $8**"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Anna's initial budget: $16
- Amount spent: $4
- Amount left: $2
- Number of books bought: 2
- Cost of each book: \( x \)

First, we need to find out how much money Anna spent on the books. We can do this by subtracting the amount she has left from her initial budget:

\[ 16 - 4 - 2 = 10 \]

So, Anna spent $10 on the 2 books. Since both books cost the same amount, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x = 10 \]

To find the cost of each book, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost $5.

Final numerical answer:
5"
"Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first calculate 20% of 50:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

Now, we add this increase to the original number of students:

50 + 10 = 60

So, there are 60 students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class."
"To find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

Given:
- 255 blinks in 5 minutes

We want to find the time \( t \) for 459 blinks.

The proportion can be set up as:
\[ \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{t \text{ minutes}} \]

Cross-multiplying to solve for \( t \):
\[ 255t = 459 \times 5 \]

\[ 255t = 2295 \]

Dividing both sides by 255:
\[ t = \frac{2295}{255} \]

\[ t = 9 \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

The final numerical answer is:
9 minutes"

"Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry, so Dior took 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 hours (since ""over 4 hours longer"" means at least 5 hours, but we can use 9 as a clear example of ""well over"").

Now, we add up the time each person took:
Amalia: 4 hours
Megan: 6 hours
Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"John visits his parents twice a month, and each visit takes 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph. Since he makes a round trip, we need to calculate the one-way distance and then double it for the round trip distance.

First, we calculate the one-way distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since it's a round trip, we double the one-way distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:
\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in one hour.
2. Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in a 10-hour shift.
3. Determine the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in the 10-hour shift.
4. Subtract the number of toys produced by the first 4 workers from the total order and the remaining toys needed to find out how many toys the fifth worker produced in the 10-hour shift.
5. Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour.

Let's start with step 1:

- The first 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The next 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.
- Therefore, the first 4 workers produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Step 2:

- In a 10-hour shift, the first 4 workers produce \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

Step 3:

- The total order is 400 toys, and after the first 4 workers have worked, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means the first 4 workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Step 4:

- Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys in the 10-hour shift, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in the 10-hour shift.

Step 5:

- To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift: \(180 \div 10 = 18\).

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, and Kory's dog is 60 pounds. So, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, so the 16 stickers he had were the other half. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many M&M he has in total:

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies each day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the distance by the daily distance:

\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we calculate its speed as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \( A \), by Madeline as \( M \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So we can write:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know that Arnold painted 13 eggs. We need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be put into a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:

\[ \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:

\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

25 pounds"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be made into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree:

\[ 80\% \times 80 \text{ feet} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can make is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Their combined salary is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

The total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and the beach portion of the trail is 2 miles, we can determine her speed on the beach. 

Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, we can write:

\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed, so her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since the sidewalk portion of the trail is 1 mile, the time it takes her to walk this distance is:

\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

She wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks needed to save $28 is:

\[ \frac{28}{4} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob had:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

2. Next, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. If he loses 10 marbles from his current 36 marbles, he will have:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees for him to be able to drink it.

Let's assume the second mug is at the minimum temperature that allows the mixture to be at least 40 degrees. The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.
- Therefore, the total number of cows added is \(20 \times 21 = 420\).

Now, let's calculate the number of chickens added:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- In three weeks, there are 21 days.
- Therefore, the total number of chickens added is \(10 \times 21 = 210\).

Next, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Total number of cows after three weeks: \(50 + 420 = 470\)
- Total number of chickens after three weeks: \(20 + 210 = 230\)

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
- Total number of animals: \(470 + 230 = 700\)

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

Now, let's apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell will get in total:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels/pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, to find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost of each single bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the information given:
   - If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then \(x\) potatoes make 18 scoops.
   - We can write this as \(\frac{3}{2} = \frac{x}{18}\).

4. Solving for \(x\):
   - Cross-multiplying gives \(3 \times 18 = 2 \times x\).
   - So, \(54 = 2x\).
   - Dividing both sides by 2 gives \(x = 27\).

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats in those 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to get the total number of eggs:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: Jess can see that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. So, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Step 3: The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of men and women on the bus initially, and then account for the 20 women who alight at the next stop.

1. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14.

2. The total number of passengers is 84. Since the ratio parts sum to 14, each part represents 84 / 14 = 6 passengers.

3. Therefore, the number of men on the bus is 5 parts * 6 passengers/part = 30 men.

4. The number of women on the bus is 9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales.
2. Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day from the bouquet sales.
3. Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets per day.
4. Sum the total number of sunflowers sold from both the individual sunflowers and the bouquets per day.
5. Multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3 to get the total for 3 days.

Let's start with step 1:
- Faraday earns $26 per day from selling sunflowers.
- Each sunflower costs $2.
- Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

Now, step 2:
- Faraday earns $56 per day from selling bouquets.
- Each bouquet costs $8.
- Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.

Next, step 3:
- Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
- Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.

Now, step 4:
- The total number of sunflowers sold per day is 13 sunflowers (from individual sales) + 84 sunflowers (from bouquets) = 97 sunflowers.

Finally, step 5:
- The total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is 97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
291"
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory, so we calculate 60% of 20:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \]

Adam sells 12 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Since he sells each rock for $7, the total revenue is:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. The loss is the difference between his initial investment and his revenue:

\[ 100 - 84 = 16 \]

So, Adam loses $16."
"To find out how many days it will take for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scene and then sum them up.

For large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

For medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

For small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum up the days required for each size:
- Total days = 9 (large) + 6 (medium) + 7 (small) = 22 days.

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Distance for the first part of the trip: 110 miles
- Distance for the second part of the trip: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Time for the first part of the trip: 2 hours
- Time for the second part of the trip: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning with the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressing this as a percentage:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells.
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected \(22 / 2 = 11\) seashells.

Now, let's find the total number of seashells they collected:

- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

Total seashells = \(27 + 22 + 11 = 60\)

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person gets:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Each person gets 20 seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each on the weekdays (Monday to Friday), which is 5 days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:

5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Adding the carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend gives us the total number of carrots he eats in a week:

20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots

"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price, which means he sells each device for $20 * 2 = $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
Profit per device = Selling price - Buying price
Profit per device = $40 - $20 = $20

Now, let's calculate the total profit from selling all the devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday:
- Last Monday, he bought 2 devices, so the profit from Monday's devices is 2 * $20 = $40.
- Last Tuesday, he bought 4 devices, so the profit from Tuesday's devices is 4 * $20 = $80.

Total profit = Profit from Monday + Profit from Tuesday
Total profit = $40 + $80 = $120

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Isabel's height is given as 7 feet.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is:
   \[
   7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is:
   \[
   5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of Carl's cane is:
   \[

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11,500 bottles.

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they would need to produce, we subtract the number of bottles they can produce from the total number required:
11,500 bottles - 4,200 bottles = 7,300 bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7,300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Carla has 8 identical octuplets. 
2. 3/4 of them are dressed in purple, and 1/4 in blue. 
3. So, the number of purple-wearing octuplets is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \).
4. The number of blue-wearing octuplets is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \).

Next, we know that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows.

5. All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
6. 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \).

So, the total number of octuplets wearing bows is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

7. Out of the 4 bow-wearers, 2 are purple and 2 are blue.
8. The probability that a bow-wearing octuplet is wearing purple is \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \).

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

9. \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \).

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sells half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left.
4. He then sells another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. One quarter of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. After selling 10 square meters, he has 30 square meters left.
6. He then sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earns 30 * $3 = $90 from the remaining land.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $170 after selling all his unused land."

"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs that were found:

Lamar: 5 eggs
Stacy: 10 eggs
Charlie: 8 eggs
Mei: 4 eggs

Total found: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. So, we calculate 60% of 400:

\[0.60 \times 400 = 240\]

Adding this to the 400 apartments gives us the total number of apartments in the third complex:

\[400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

Now, we can find the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is:

"Let's break down the information given:

- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
- A 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
- An 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old produces as \(x\). So, an 8-year-old produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits

Adding these up:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope:
\[ R = 4B \]

2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation.

First, from \( B = Y - 7 \), we can express \( R \) as:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Now, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."

2. Let's say each of them gave an amount of \( x \) dollars to their little sister. After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money, so we can write the equation:
   \[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

3. Simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[ 15 - x = 12 \]

4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

5. So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his little sister, so he is left with:

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The dimensions of each bedroom are 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \).
   - Therefore, the special box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special box:**
   - The special box costs $12 and contains 120 pods.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods you can get for $1:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he withdraws is:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, the number of bills he uses is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   The amount he uses to pay the bill is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after using 45% of the 5-inch piece on Monday, and then calculate how many days he can use 20% of the remaining chalk before it gets smaller than 2 inches.

1. Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday:
   - 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

2. Calculate the amount of chalk left after Monday:
   - 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

3. Determine the amount of chalk used each day:
   - 20% of the remaining chalk each day = 0.20 * remaining chalk

4. Calculate the number of days before the chalk is less than 2 inches:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James has 30 teeth in total.
2. The dentist drills 4 of them.
3. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Now, we need to find out how many teeth the dentist has fixed in total. The dentist has fixed the teeth by both drilling and capping, so the total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist has fixed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the dentist has fixed 50% of James' teeth.

50%"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus purchased:

Total gallons of milk purchased = 4000 gallons
Cost per gallon = $3.5

Total cost = 4000 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $14,000

Next, we need to determine how much of the milk had passed the expiry date:

Fraction of milk that passed the expiry date = 2/5

Gallons of milk that passed the expiry date = 2/5 * 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons

Now, we calculate the refund amount based on the cost per gallon:

Refund per gallon = $3.5
Total refund = 1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5,600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5,600."
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school gets.

First, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. So, we need to find out how many sets of $500 are in $27000:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Therefore, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400
\]

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school gets:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800

"Let's break down the sequence of events to find out how many apples Newton brought home.

1. Two apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. So, Newton has 1 apple in his hand.
2. Newton picked up the two apples, putting one in his pocket and throwing the other one into the tree, which caused 5 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 1 (in his hand) + 1 (in his pocket) = 2 apples, and 5 more apples fell out.
3. Newton picked up these 5 apples, putting all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, which caused 6 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 1 (in his hand) + 1 (in his pocket) = 2 apples, and 6 more apples fell out.
4. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie. The apples he picked up are the 6 that fell out, plus the 1 he had in his hand, making a total of 7 apples.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 7."

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices her friends will eat:
- Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices.
- Kate has 6 friends.
- Total cheese pizza slices = 6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices her friends will eat:
- Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices.
- Kate has 6 friends.
- Total pepperoni pizza slices = 6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices.

Now, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required:
- A cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Total cheese pizza slices needed = 36.
- Number of cheese pizzas needed = 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

- A pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Total pepperoni pizza slices needed = 24.
- Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs built per hour**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs melting per 15 minutes**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the net loss of snowballs per hour is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs.

3. **Net gain of snowballs per hour**: Therefore, the net gain of snowballs per hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs.

4. **Target number of snowballs**: Jay wants to have 60 snowballs.

5. **Time to reach 60 snowballs**: To find out how many hours it will take to get 60 snowballs, we divide the target number of snowballs by the net gain per hour: \(60 \div 12 = 5\) hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final answer:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age when Digimon came out, and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since Digimon is celebrating its 20th anniversary, it came out 20 years ago.

2. We know that John is currently 28 years old. If we go back 20 years, John would have been 8 years old at the time Digimon came out.

3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim must have been half of that age, which is 4 years old.

4. Now, to find out how old Jim is now, we add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon came out to Jim's age at that time.

So, Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day.

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages they had at the end of the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Initial bandages} + 50 - 38
   \]
   Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \( x \). So, at the end of the first day, they had:
   \[
   x + 50 - 38 = x + 12
   \]

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 28 bandages. The number of bandages they had at the end of the second day is:
   \[
   (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16
   \]

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they received 100 bandages. They also used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The number of bandages they had at the end of the third day is:
   \[
   (x - 16) + 100 - 25 = x + 69
   \]
   According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 69 = 78
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 78 - 69 = 9
   \]

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{9}\)."

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

Step 1: Number of days Jen works in April
Since there are 4 weeks in April and she works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate
Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]
For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance
Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10:

"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we can break down the problem into steps and add the numbers accordingly.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after 10:00) + 150 (evening) = 320

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."

"First, let's find the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, which means he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's calculate the amount of root beer remaining after each event:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remain.
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remain.
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remain.

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining 8 gallons of root beer were shared equally among the 3 people.

To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people:

"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
2. Calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes to get the final answer.

Let's start with step 1:

1. One-third of the fish have red stripes. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]
   Therefore, there are 22 fish with red stripes.

2. Now, we calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes:
   \[
   66 - 22 = 44
   \]
   So, there are 44 fish remaining.

3. Next, we calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish. We know that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes:
   \[
   \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
   \]
   Therefore, there are 20 fish with blue stripes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, she had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which originally had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses 3 colors. Therefore, \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors left.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

The total miles walked by all four dogs per day is the average miles per dog multiplied by the number of dogs. So, we have:

\[ \text{Total miles} = \text{Average miles per dog} \times \text{Number of dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 3 \, \text{miles/dog} \times 4 \, \text{dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 12 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs:
- First dog: 1 mile
- Second dog: 4 miles
- Third dog: 3 miles

Adding these up gives us the total miles walked by the first three dogs:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = \text{Total miles} - \text{Miles for the first three dogs} \]
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 12 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 4 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."

So, the total weight of the tunas is:
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, if a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram:

128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.00

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64.00 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we first need to determine the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for. 

The buying price is $72. 

So, the selling price is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed from the air, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum them up.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum up the water removed at each setting:

- Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."

"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister, including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:

\[ \text{Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month} = \text{Total Amount} - \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Jordan's 2 children require a total of 5 diapers each per day, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 diapers per day for both children.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

Since Jordan changes the other half, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is given by:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's guess and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bus has a capacity of 200 people.
2. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
3. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]
4. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again. So, the number of people who entered at the second stop is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]
5. After the second stop, the number of people on the bus is:
   \[
   60 + 30 = 90
   \]
6. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[
   90 \times 2 = 180
   \]
7. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the number of remaining spaces on the bus is:
   \[
   200 - 180 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost of One Visit:**
   - The initial cost of one visit is $2.

2. **Cost Increase After 5 Years:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years.
   - A 150% increase means the cost is now 250% of the original cost (100% + 150% = 250%).
   - 250% of $2 is \(2 \times 2.5 = $5\).

3. **Number of Visits Per Year:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.

4. **Total Visits in the First 5 Years:**
   - In 5 years, she visits \(5 \times 3 = 15\) times.
   - The cost for these visits is \(15 \times 2 = $30\).

5. **Total Visits in the Next 3 Years:**
   - In the next 3 years, she visits \(3 \times 3 = 9\) times.
   - The cost for these visits is \(9 \times 5 = $45\).

6. **Total Cost Over 8 Years:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years.
   - Total cost = $30 + $45 = $75.

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all visits to the museum."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of students and then figure out how many sessions are required given that only 8 students can participate at a time.

1. There are 4 grades (4, 5, 6, and 7) and each grade has 10 students in the top 10 for earning points.
2. Therefore, the total number of students is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Since only 8 students can participate in each session, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students per session:

\[
\frac{40}{8} = 5
\]

So, it will take 5 sessions for all 40 students to try the escape room. Since each session takes 45 minutes, the total time required is:

\[
5 \times 45 = 225 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and roof frames.

For the wooden tables:
4 tables * $20/table = $80

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the frames together:
$80 + $20 = $100

Therefore, Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate its length as:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of secret steakhouse seasoning required based on the amount of ground beef.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. To find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs, we divide 80 by 16:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we multiply 5 by 2:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute:
\[ 16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

For the remaining minutes (36 - 16 = 20 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.20/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the costs of both parts together:
\[ \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of a 36-minute call is:

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost of adding nail art to all 20 nails (10 on each hand).
3. Add the discounted price of the mani/pedi and the nail art cost to get the total.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.
- The original price for a manicure is $35.
- The original price for a pedicure is $40.
- The discount is 20%, so the discount amount for each service is 20% of the original price.

Discounted price for a manicure = $35 - (20% of $35) = $35 - ($35 * 0.20) = $35 - $7 = $28
Discounted price for a pedicure = $40 - (20% of $40) = $40 - ($40 * 0.20) = $40 - $8 = $32

Total discounted price for both services = $28 + $32 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the cost of adding nail art to all 20 nails.
- The cost of nail art per nail is $3.
- Karen has 20 nails (10 on each hand).

Total cost for nail art = 20 nails * $3 per nail = $60

Step 3: Add the discounted price of the mani/pedi and the nail art cost to get the total.
Total cost = Total discounted price for both services + Total cost for nail art
Total cost = $60 + $60 = $120

Therefore, Karen would pay $120 in all."

From point 3, we can find out how many paintings Kim has:
\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = \text{Shelley's paintings} - 8 = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

Kim has 31 paintings."
"Let's break down the price changes step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November**: $40

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   - 80% of $40 = 0.80 * $40 = $32
   - New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   - 50% of $72 = 0.50 * $72 = $36
   - New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

4 lessons * $80/lesson = $320

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the lessons with the veteran. The standard rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is 75% of the standard rate.

75% of $80 = 0.75 * $80 = $60

Now, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 2 1-hour lessons with the veteran at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.

2 lessons * $60/lesson = $120

Finally, we add the amounts from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding any stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the 6000 km distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered. We do this by dividing the distance Michael has traveled by the total distance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time in minutes for the 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Time per classroom = 15 minutes
Number of classrooms = 80

Total time required = 15 minutes/classroom * 80 classrooms = 1200 minutes

**Step 2: Determine the total available time in minutes for the 5 days.**

An 8-hour day = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

1. Calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass.
2. Determine how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test.
3. Calculate how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test to meet the 70% requirement.

First, let's find the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, and the total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests, we have:

\[ \text{Total questions} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]
\[ \text{Questions needed to pass} = 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ \text{Questions correct on first test} = 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test to reach the total of 77 questions:

\[ \text{Questions needed on second test} = 77 - 42 = 35 \]

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into smaller steps based on the given ratios.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 customers that come into the dealership, 1 will buy a car.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \(15 \times 2 = 30\) customers.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 30 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer.
   - Therefore, to get 30 customers, Jason needs \(30 \times 25 = 750\) telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

**Final Answer:**
750"
"To find the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 4 people, so there are 4 flashlights.
2. There are 8 rooms, so there are 2 flashlights per room, which means \(8 \times 2 = 16\) flashlights for the rooms.
3. For the candles:
   - Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms have 4 small candles each, which means \(4 \times 4 = 16\) small candles.
   - The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so \(4\) rooms have 5 medium candles each, which means \(4 \times 5 = 20\) medium candles.

Now, let's add up all the flashlights and candles:

- Total flashlights: \(4\) (people) + \(16\) (rooms) = \(20\)
- Total candles: \(16\) (small) + \(20\) (medium) = \(36\)

So, the total number of candles and flashlights is \(20 + 36 = 56\).

Each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is not mentioned, but since the problem states ""once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides,"" we can assume the sixth side is included in the total time.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = \(5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 32.5\) minutes

The Rubik's cube takes 32.5 minutes."
"Given that there were 20 helmets, we can determine the number of robots and footballs based on the information provided.

1. The number of robots is half the number of helmets:
   \[
   \text{Number of robots} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

2. The number of helmets is half the number of footballs:
   \[
   \text{Number of footballs} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

Now, to find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
\[
\text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70

"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish.
2. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish.
3. Subtract the total drying time with the old varnish from the total drying time with the new varnish.

Step 1: Total drying time with the old varnish
- Drying time for one painting with the old varnish: 7 minutes
- Number of paintings: 6
- Total drying time = 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes

Step 2: Total drying time with the new varnish
- Drying time for one painting with the new varnish: 12 minutes
- Number of paintings: 6
- Total drying time = 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Step 3: Difference in total drying time
- Difference = Total drying time with new varnish - Total drying time with old varnish
- Difference = 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break down the problem into parts and then sum up the total.

1. For the 4 plants that need half a cup of water each:
   \(4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2\) cups

2. For the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each:
   \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups

3. The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. First, we need to find out how many plants are left:
   Total plants = 20
   Plants needing half a cup = 4
   Plants needing 1 cup = 8
   Plants needing a quarter of a cup = 20 - 4 - 8 = 8
   So, for the 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water each:
   \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) cups

\(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To return home, Phineas will need to cover a total distance of 200 yards, with half of that distance on land and the other half in water. This means he will hop 100 yards on land and swim 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent hopping on land and swimming in water to find the total time:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home."
"Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks for his project. Popsicles come 8 to a box. 

To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:

56 popsicle sticks ÷ 8 popsicle sticks/box = 7 boxes

Each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for 7 boxes is:

7 boxes × $2.00/box = $14.00

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. 

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). Therefore, the cost of the main phone is \( 2x \). We know that \( 2x = 20 \), so we can solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10. Since there are four additional phones, the total cost for the additional phones is:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Now, we add the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones to get the total cost of the whole phone plan:

\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

The whole phone plan costs $60."
"Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen, he makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts daily.

June typically has 30 days. Therefore, in June, Derrick makes 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts.

If he sells each doughnut for $2, then the total money he makes in June is 3600 * $2 = $7200.

Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."

Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and he has trained to be 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speaking speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. There are 10 pages, and each page has 450 words.

\[ \text{Total words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New speaking speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw on these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining days) = 500 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 500."
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is halved from the previous rate, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, we add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
210"
"To make 4 gallons of lemonade, Tim needs 4 gallons * 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon = 4 cups of lemon juice.

For the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart, he would need 2 times the amount of lemon juice, which is 2 * 1 cup = 2 cups of lemon juice.

In total, Tim needs 4 cups + 2 cups = 6 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, to get 6 cups of juice, Tim will need 6 lemons * 6 = 36 lemons.

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
- Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32\]

Now, we can solve for \(R\):

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]
\[12 + R = 32\]
\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the average enrollment at Butler High School.
2. Subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

First, we know that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."

"Let's break down the information given:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]

\[ x = 31 - 29 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, calculate the total number of legs for all the tables:
   - Each table has 4 legs.
   - James is putting together 4 tables.
   - So, the total number of legs is \(4 \text{ legs/table} \times 4 \text{ tables} = 16 \text{ legs}\).

2. Next, calculate the total number of screws needed for all the legs:
   - Each leg needs 2 screws.
   - So, the total number of screws needed is \(16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 32 \text{ screws}\).

3. Finally, calculate the number of screws left over:
   - James has 40 screws.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

First, we need to find out how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{\text{Distance Vanessa ran}}{2} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know Aaron's speed. Since Aaron completed 2 miles in 16 minutes, his speed is:

\[ \text{Speed of Aaron} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:

\[ \text{Speed of Vanessa} = 2 \times \text{Speed of Aaron} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we can calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:

\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}}} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 4 \text{ minutes/mile} = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line needed.
Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total amount of line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.
The caretaker already has 6 feet of line, so the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."

1. Calculate the cost price per watermelon.
2. Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost price per watermelon.**

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.**

A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price. So, the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, then she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is currently 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. Each chicken has 2 legs.
2. Each cow has 4 legs.
3. The total number of animals is 20.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm.
