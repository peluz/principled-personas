"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Janet has each day, which is 16 eggs.

Next, we account for the eggs Janet uses:
- She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
- She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used each day is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs to find out how many eggs she has left to sell:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we start by identifying the amount of each type of fiber required.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The amount of white fiber required is half the amount of blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

Next, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total amount of fiber needed:
\[
2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
\]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The value increased by 150% of the total cost of the house and repairs.

The total cost of the house and repairs is:
\[ \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000 \]

A 150% increase on \$130,000 means the value increased by:
\[ 150\% \times \$130,000 = 1.5 \times \$130,000 = \$195,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ \$130,000 + \$195,000 = \$325,000 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ \$325,000 - \$130,000 = \$195,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"To determine the total number of meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total distance James runs in one session.
2. Multiply that by the number of sessions he has in a week.

First, we know that James runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the distance he runs in one session is:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, we know that James runs 3 times a week. So, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of meters James runs in a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily feed requirement for the flock:**
   - Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.
   - Wendi has 20 chickens.
   - Therefore, the total daily feed requirement is:
     \[
     3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon:**
   - In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
   - In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
   - The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
     \[
     15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
     \]

3. **Calculate the remaining feed needed for the final meal:**
   - The total daily feed requirement is 60 cups.
   - The feed already given is 40 cups.
   - Therefore, the remaining feed needed for the final meal is:
     \[
     60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
     \]

Thus, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the first glass} = \$5 \]

Since every second glass costs 60% of $5, the cost for the second glass is:
\[ \text{Cost of the second glass} = 0.60 \times 5 = \$3 \]

This pattern continues, so the cost for the glasses will alternate between $5 and $3. To find the total cost for 16 glasses, we can break it down into 8 pairs of glasses (since 16 divided by 2 is 8).

The cost for each pair of glasses is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pair} = \$5 + \$3 = \$8 \]

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \times 8 = \$64 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we start by defining the number of sheep each city has in terms of the number of sheep Seattle has.

1. Let the number of sheep Seattle has be denoted by \( S \).
   \[
   S = 20
   \]

2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, the number of sheep Charleston has is:
   \[
   C = 4 \times S = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, the number of sheep Toulouse has is:
   \[
   T = 2 \times C = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep from Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
   \[
   T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then subtract the distance he has covered towards getting home.

1. **Distance traveled in the first 3 hours:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Distance traveled in the next 2 hours in standstill traffic:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 0 \, \text{miles} \quad \text{(since he is not moving)}
   \]

3. **Distance traveled in the next 0.5 hours at 30 mph:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. **Distance traveled in the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

5. **Total distance traveled:**
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 180 \, \text{miles} + 0 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 315 \, \text{miles}
   \]

6. **Distance towards home:**
   - He traveled 15 miles in the first 0.5 hours.
   - He traveled 120 miles in the next 1.5 hours.
   \[
   \text{Distance towards home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles}
   \]

7. **Distance from home:**
   \[
   \text{Distance from home} = \text{Total Distance} - \text{Distance towards home} = 315 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, John is \(\boxed{180}\) miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the appropriate rates.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are **$460**."

\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

Thus, the total cost is \(\boxed{694}\)."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the break-even point. This is the point where the total revenue from selling lemons equals the total costs (initial planting cost plus annual costs).

Let's break down the costs and revenue:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90 (cost to plant the tree)
2. **Annual Costs**: $3 (cost to water and feed the tree)
3. **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

The total cost after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 90 + 3n \]

The total revenue after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10.5n \]

To find the break-even point, we set the total revenue equal to the total cost:
\[ 10.5n = 90 + 3n \]

Now, solve for \( n \):
\[ 10.5n - 3n = 90 \]
\[ 7.5n = 90 \]
\[ n = \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n = 12 \]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money from the lemon tree.

**Final Answer:**
12 years"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. **Sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. **Sold to the red house:**
   She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. **Sold at the orange house:**
   She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there.
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   We know that after the orange house, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find out how many students are left after accounting for those who enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many are left for hip-hop dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance (12) and divide it by the total number of students (20), then multiply by 100:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 60\% \]"

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to break down her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from teaching are \( 20 \times 35 = 700 \) dollars.
- Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are \( 700 \times 50 = 35000 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from coaching are \( 30 \times 15 = 450 \) dollars.
- Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are \( 450 \times 50 = 22500 \) dollars.

Now, we add her annual earnings from both jobs to find her total annual salary:
- Total annual salary = Annual earnings from teaching + Annual earnings from coaching
- Total annual salary = \( 35000 + 22500 = 57500 \) dollars.

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is **$57,500**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in one day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many eggs she eats in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

To convert the total number of eggs into dozens, we use the fact that 1 dozen equals 12 eggs:

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to hike the 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time already spent hiking:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time to hike the remaining distance:**

"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Determine the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
3. Calculate the number of years ago Raymond's son was born.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Therefore, Raymond's current age is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \]

Next, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Since Raymond is currently 25 years old, the age difference between Raymond and his son is:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \]
This means Raymond's son is currently 2 years old.

To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the current age of Raymond's son from Raymond's current age:
\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 23 years ago. The final answer is:

\[ 2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm} \]

So, the candle will be \(\boxed{8}\) centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price (since he received a 25% discount). Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

The relationship can be expressed as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \(\boxed{26}\)."
"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the boxes of pizza:
- The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
- The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
- The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Let \(x\) be the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered. Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the total cost of the pizza is \(8.50x\) dollars.

The total amount Marie paid is the sum of the cost of the chicken meal, milk, apples, and pizza, which is $50. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[33 + 8.50x = 50\]

To find \(x\), we first isolate the term with \(x\) by subtracting 33 from both sides of the equation:
\[8.50x = 50 - 33\]
\[8.50x = 17\]

Next, we solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 8.50:
\[x = \frac{17}{8.50} = 2\]

So, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza."
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost for the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
\[
3 \times 16.50 = 49.50
\]
So, Mishka spent $49.50 on shorts.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
\[
3 \times 22.50 = 67.50
\]
So, Mishka spent $67.50 on pants.

Then, let's calculate the cost for the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
\[
3 \times 42 = 126
\]
So, Mishka spent $126 on shoes.

Now, we sum the costs of all the items:
\[
49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243
\]

Therefore, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is \(\boxed{243}\)."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days:**
   - Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night.
   - Therefore, in 60 days, she will consume:
     \[
     60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings}
     \]

2. **Determine how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia needs:**
   - Each carton contains 15 servings.
   - To find the number of cartons needed, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the ice cream:**
   - Each carton costs $4.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total distance of the trip: 60 miles.
2. Determine the distance to the first stop: 20 miles.
3. Determine the distance to the end of the trip from the second stop: 15 miles.

First, we calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we subtract 15 miles from the 40 miles calculated above:
\[ 40 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the cost of the other pair of high heels is twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

The problem also states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell's and Allen's current ages. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive real number. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age. Since Allen's age is \(11x\):

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Let's break down the guesses from Gunter's friends:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is \(40 + 20 = 60\).
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\), so 25% more than 80 is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average of these guesses, we sum them up and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Calculate the daily time spent on each dog:
   Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.

2. Calculate the total daily time spent on all dogs:
   John has 10 dogs, so the total daily time is:
   \[
   10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. Calculate the weekly time spent on all dogs:
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly time is:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( G \) be the number of gold coins.
- Let \( S \) be the number of silver coins.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( G + S = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of jewels Aaron has:**
   - Raymond has 40 jewels.
   - Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   - First, calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
     \[
     \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]
   - Then, add 5 to this amount to find the number of jewels Aaron has:
     \[
     20 + 5 = 25
     \]
   - So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

2. **Determine the number of jewels Siobhan has:**
   - Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   - Since Aaron has 25 jewels, subtract 2 from this amount to find the number of jewels Siobhan has:
     \[
     25 - 2 = 23
     \]

Therefore, Siobhan has \(\boxed{23}\) jewels."
"First, we need to determine how many points Mike scored in the second 20 minutes. We know he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes and that in the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points.

To find 25% more than 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the number of points scored in the second 20 minutes is:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we add the points scored in both halves of the game to find the total points:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This can be calculated by dividing 60 by 4:

\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the amount of money he spent on the video games plus the money he has left equals the total amount of money he had from selling the lego sets. We can verify this by subtracting the money spent on video games and the remaining money from the total money he had:
\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]
This calculation confirms that the money spent and the remaining money are consistent with the total money he had.

Since John spent all the money from the lego sets on video games and has no lego sets left, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find the average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run each day:**
   - First day: 60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles
   - Second day: 20 miles / 2 = 10 miles
   - Third day: 10 miles

2. **Total distance run in a week:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles + 10 miles + 10 miles = 40 miles

3. **Total time run in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   - Total time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

4. **Average speed:**
   - Speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Speed = 40 miles / 6 hours = \(\frac{40}{6}\) miles per hour = \(\frac{20}{3}\) miles per hour ≈ 6.67 miles per hour

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6.67 \text{ miles per hour}}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds, and then calculate the distances she covers while running and walking over the six-hour period.

First, let's find Dana's running speed. We know that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour and that her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we find her walking speed. We know that her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking over the six-hour period. So, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking. The distance covered while running is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance covered while walking is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances covered while running and walking:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

   \]

2. **Determine the age of Brandon's iPhone:**
   - Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, we need to determine the distance Polly can throw the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. According to the problem, when Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone.

The distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone is 400 feet. Therefore, with the gemstone, she can throw it:
\[ 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon. The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. Therefore, Polly can stand:
\[ 1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet} \]
outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"

"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given.

1. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes.
2. She purchased a package of Post-it notes, which we will denote as \( x \).
3. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes.
4. After all these actions, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

We can express this situation with the following equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent:

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight Uriah needs to remove to reach the total of 15 pounds. This can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is:

\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

So, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys."

"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we first need to calculate the total cost of one trip to the movies, which includes the cost of a ticket and the cost of popcorn. The cost of a ticket is $7 and the cost of popcorn is $7, so the total cost for one trip is:

\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Peter can afford to go to the movies with his $42. We do this by dividing his total amount of money by the cost of one trip to the movies:

\[ 42 \div 14 = 3 \]

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies \(\boxed{3}\) times."
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total weight the bridge can carry:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight limit} = 5000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the weight of the empty truck and the driver:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of the driver and empty truck} = 3755 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the driver and the empty truck:**

"To determine the number of good oranges in the basket, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Total Oranges**: The basket contains 25 oranges.

2. **Bad Oranges**: There is 1 bad orange.

3. **Unripe Oranges**: 20% of the oranges are unripe. To find the number of unripe oranges:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 0.2 \times 25 = 5
   \]
   So, there are 5 unripe oranges.

4. **Sour Oranges**: There are 2 sour oranges.

5. **Good Oranges**: To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:
   \[
   \text{Good Oranges} = 25 - (\text{Bad Oranges} + \text{Unripe Oranges} + \text{Sour Oranges})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Good Oranges} = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) = 25 - 8 = 17

Therefore, the number of good oranges is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials and the construction of the brooch. Janet pays $500 for the materials and $800 for the jeweler to construct it. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of insuring the brooch. Janet pays 10% of the total cost to get it insured. To find 10% of $1300, we multiply $1300 by 0.10:

\[ 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost of the materials and construction to find the final amount Janet paid:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial annual pension**: Marcy's initial annual pension is $50,000 per year for the first 20 years.

2. **Calculate the additional pension after 20 years**: Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension is $50,000, so 5% of $50,000 is calculated as follows:
   \[
   0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
   \]
   This means she gets an additional $2,500 per year starting after 20 years.

3. **Determine the total annual pension after 30 years**: Since she quits after 30 years, she has been receiving the additional 5% pension for 10 years (from year 21 to year 30). Therefore, her total annual pension after 30 years is the initial pension plus the additional pension:
   \[
   50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500
   \]

Thus, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years is \(\boxed{52500}\)."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Total for the first half: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is reduced by 10%. 
   - The reduced monthly charge: \( 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \) dollars.
   - Total for the second half: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount Paid for the Year:**

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we can use the information about her recent trip and the capacity of her gas tank.

First, we know that Sophia traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. We can calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) for her car using this information:
\[
\text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons. Since we know the car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate the total distance by multiplying the mpg by the tank capacity:
\[
\text{Total miles} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, Sophia can drive \(\boxed{300}\) miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school sends \(5 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 10 \text{ players}\).

2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team).
   - Therefore, each school sends \(2 \text{ coaches}\).

3. Since there are 4 schools, we need to multiply the number of people sent by one school by 4.
   - Total players: \(10 \text{ players/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 40 \text{ players}\).
   - Total coaches: \(2 \text{ coaches/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 8 \text{ coaches}\).

4. Adding the total number of players and coaches gives us the total number of people:
   - Total people: \(40 \text{ players} + 8 \text{ coaches} = 48 \text{ people}\).

Thus, the total number of people sent by all the schools is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"To determine the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Number of Diamonds:**
   The problem states there are 175 diamonds.
   \[
   \text{Diamonds} = 175
   \]

2. **Number of Rubies:**
   The problem states there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Therefore, we subtract 35 from the number of diamonds.
   \[
   \text{Rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140
   \]

3. **Number of Emeralds:**
   The problem states there are twice the number of emeralds as the rubies. Therefore, we multiply the number of rubies by 2.
   \[
   \text{Emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

4. **Total Number of Gems:**
   To find the total number of gems, we sum the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.
   \[
   \text{Total gems} = \text{Diamonds} + \text{Rubies} + \text{Emeralds} = 175 + 140 + 280

"To determine how much money Bailey started with, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. Therefore, the total amount of money she receives from her allowance over 8 weeks is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This total amount is the sum of the money she started with and the money she received from her allowance. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x + 40 - 40 = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with \(\boxed{60}\) dollars."
"To determine how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the students.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week.**

Judy teaches 5 classes each day on weekdays (Monday to Friday), and 8 classes on Saturday. There are 5 weekdays and 1 Saturday in a week.

\[
\text{Total classes on weekdays} = 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}
\]

\[
\text{Total classes on Saturday} = 8 \text{ classes}
\]

\[
\text{Total classes in a week} = 25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.**

Each class has 15 students.

\[
\text{Total students in a week} = 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from the students.**

Judy charges $15.00 per student.

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 495 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the revenue from the brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie slice for $3.
- He sells 43 brownie slices.

\[
\text{Revenue from brownies} = 43 \times 3 = 129
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake slice for $4.
- He sells 23 cheesecake slices.

\[
\text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 23 \times 4 = 92
\]

Now, we sum the revenues from both brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount of money raised:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 129 + 92 = 221

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ 5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$150 \text{ per cell phone} = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the total interest charged on the purchase. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ 5 \times 2\% \times \$150 = 5 \times 0.02 \times 150 = 5 \times 3 = \$15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela will pay for the five cell phones, including interest, is:

\[ \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Shiela will pay this amount in installments over 3 months. To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by 3:

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level. We know that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level has a square footage of 16.

Let's denote the square footage of the levels from top to bottom as follows:
- Level 1 (top level): \(16\) square feet
- Level 2: \(\frac{16}{2} = 8\) square feet
- Level 3: \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) square feet
- Level 4 (bottom level): \(\frac{4}{2} = 2\) square feet

Next, we calculate the total square footage of all four levels:
\[
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \text{ square feet}
\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[
\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is:

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days.
2. Determine the amount of dog food needed for the remaining days of the first year.
3. Sum the amounts from steps 1 and 2 to find the total amount of dog food used in the first year.
4. Calculate how many bags of dog food are needed based on the total amount of dog food used.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days.**

Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days.
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of dog food needed for the remaining days of the first year.**

There are 365 days in a year. After the first 180 days, there are:
\[ 365 - 180 = 185 \text{ days} \]
Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for these 185 days.
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 3: Sum the amounts from steps 1 and 2 to find the total amount of dog food used in the first year.**

\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 4: Calculate how many bags of dog food are needed based on the total amount of dog food used.**

Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food. To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total amount of dog food by the number of cups per bag and round up to the nearest whole number (since you can't buy a fraction of a bag).
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is:

"First, let's determine Alex's weight. Grace weighs 125 pounds. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]

Substituting Grace's weight into the equation:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]

Then, subtract 2 from 500:

\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Next, we need to find their combined weights. We add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 125 + 498 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( W \) be the number of games won.
- Let \( L \) be the number of games lost.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The number of games won is 8 more than the number of games lost.

We can express these as the following equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \) using the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the number of games won is \(\boxed{15}\)."

   - Gene goes on 4 vacations each year.
   - Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks is \(11 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ vacations/year} = 44 \text{ blocks}\).

The total number of quilt blocks Gene has is \(\boxed{44}\)."
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of rings for each of the three times the alarm went off and then sum them up.

1. **First time the alarm went off:**
   - The alarm rang 4 times.
   - Number of rings: \(4\)

2. **Second time the alarm went off:**
   - The alarm rang for three times as long as the first time.
   - Since the first time it rang 4 times, the second time it rang \(3 \times 4 = 12\) times.
   - Number of rings: \(12\)

3. **Third time the alarm went off:**
   - The alarm rang for half as long as the second time.
   - Since the second time it rang 12 times, the third time it rang \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) times.
   - Number of rings: \(6\)

Now, we sum the number of rings from all three times:
\[
4 + 12 + 6 = 22
\]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.
2. **Annual Salary Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% every year for those who've stayed for five years.

First, let's calculate Sylvie's annual salary after 5 years of service. Since the salary is increased by 10% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest to find the salary after 5 years:

\[ \text{Final Salary} = \text{Initial Salary} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here, the initial salary is $600, the rate is 10% (or 0.10), and the number of years is 5.

\[ \text{Annual Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Annual Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times (1.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Annual Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times 1.61051 \]
\[ \text{Annual Salary after 5 years} = 966.306 \]

So, after 5 years, Sylvie's annual salary is approximately $966.31.

Next, we need to calculate her salary after an additional 3 years. Since the salary continues to increase by 10% each year, we use the same formula again, but this time the initial salary is $966.31 and the number of years is 3.

\[ \text{Annual Salary after 8 years} = 966.31 \times (1 + 0.10)^3 \]
\[ \text{Annual Salary after 8 years} = 966.31 \times (1.10)^3 \]
\[ \text{Annual Salary after 8 years} = 966.31 \times 1.331 \]
\[ \text{Annual Salary after 8 years} = 1288.07531 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is approximately $1288.08.

Final Answer:
\[ \boxed{1288.08} \]"
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold \(\boxed{8000}\) copies."
"First, let's determine how many guests are expected to show up. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, this means that 3/4 of the invited guests will attend.

The number of guests expected to show up is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12 \]

Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest. Therefore, the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Thus, the total amount Christina will spend is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adults and the children.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad that the adults will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ pounds/adult} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat:
- Each child will eat half as much as an adult, so each child will eat \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) pounds of potato salad.
- There are 5 children at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ pounds/child} = 25 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we add the amounts for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad needed:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ pounds} + 25 \text{ pounds} = 225 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pets each person has and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of pets Cindy has:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Determine the number of pets Marcia has:**
   Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. Since Cindy has 4 pets:
   \[
   \text{Number of pets Marcia has} = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Determine the number of pets Jan has:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Since Marcia has 6 pets:
   \[
   \text{Number of pets Jan has} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   Add the number of pets each person has:
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28
   \]

The total number of pets the three have is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of the kids using variables:
- Let \( A \) be Amy's age.
- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Let \( C \) be Corey's age.
- Let \( M \) be James's age.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. James is 10 years old, so \( M = 10 \).
2. James is 1 year younger than Corey, so \( M = C - 1 \). Since \( M = 10 \), we have \( 10 = C - 1 \), which means \( C = 11 \).
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so \( A = J + 5 \).
4. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so \( A = C - 2 \). Since \( C = 11 \), we have \( A = 11 - 2 = 9 \).
5. Now, using \( A = J + 5 \) and knowing \( A = 9 \), we can find Jackson's age: \( 9 = J + 5 \), so \( J = 9 - 5 = 4 \).

Therefore, Jackson is \(\boxed{4}\) years old."
"First, let's determine Gerald's original running time for the 400-meter hurdles. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Since Lee now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out Gerald's new time after his diet improved his speed by 10%. If his speed improved by 10%, his new time will be 90% of his original time. We can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the problem:
- Let \( D \) be the number of dogs.
- Let \( C \) be the number of cats.
- Let \( R \) be the number of rabbits.

From the problem, we know:
1. The number of dogs \( D = 60 \).
2. The number of cats \( C \) is twice the number of dogs, so \( C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \).
3. The number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, so \( R = D + C - 12 \).

Substituting the values of \( D \) and \( C \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[ R = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, which is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

The total number of students is 200. Given that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = \frac{2 \times 200}{5} = \frac{400}{5} = 80
\]

Since the rest of the students are girls, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. We know that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[
\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = \frac{2 \times 120}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[
\text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40
\]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[
\text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes before processing.

2. **Calculate the volume of tomatoes before processing**: Since the sauce made is 32 ounces and it is half the volume of the tomatoes, the volume of the tomatoes before processing is:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of cans used**: Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of tomatoes**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, the number of tomatoes Freda used is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
- 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
- Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be calculated by adding the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes, and then subtracting the 5 cars that took an exit. This total should equal the original number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit.

So, we can set up the equation as follows:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has before giving any away. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she has initially is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary decides to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

After giving away these 40 plants, the number of potted plants she will have left is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Mary also received 18 new potted plants from her plant nursery. Adding these to the remaining plants gives:

\[ 40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \( 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell \( 60 + 10 = 70 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all four friends:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."

- Science textbook: 4 pages
- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days."
"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by day and then sum it up.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
   - He also has a glass of water before bed.
   - Therefore, each weekday, John drinks \(3 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.

2. **Weekdays total:**
   - There are 5 weekdays.
   - Total glasses of water on weekdays = \(5 \times 4 = 20\).

3. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
   - He does not have a glass of water before bed on the weekends.
   - Therefore, each weekend day, John drinks \(3\) glasses of water.

4. **Weekends total:**
   - There are 2 weekend days.
   - Total glasses of water on weekends = \(2 \times 3 = 6\).

5. **Total glasses of water in a week:**
   - Total glasses of water = Weekdays total + Weekends total
   - Total glasses of water = \(20 + 6 = 26\).

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we start by understanding the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[
\text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Next, we use this rate to find the time to cover 42 miles:
\[
\text{Time to cover 42 miles} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[
42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 14 \times 10 = 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it will take the fog bank \(\boxed{140}\) minutes to cover the whole city."
"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pieces Poppy places on the board.
2. Calculate the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces.
3. Determine how many pieces Poppy's mom places.
4. Calculate the number of pieces left to be placed after her mom places her pieces.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces on the board.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]
   So, the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces is:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

2. Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy's mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]
   So, the number of pieces left to be placed after her mom places her pieces is:
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500
   \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:
\[
\boxed{500}

"To determine the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then find its inner volume. Finally, we will multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume for all three boxes.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The original dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
   - Inner width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
   - Inner height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Substituting the inner dimensions:
     \[
     V = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
     \[
     \text{Total inner volume} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\) cubic inches."
"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the information provided.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday.

Next, we calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV each day:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \( x \) episodes of 30 minutes each, which is \( 0.5x \) hours
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV over the week is given as 7 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total time as:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Now, simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting 5.5 from both sides:
\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Then, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.5:
\[ x = \frac{1.5}{0.5} = 3 \]

So, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore:**
   - Julia takes 64 seconds to reach the shore.
   - It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - Therefore, the total distance \( D \) she needs to row is:
     \[
     D = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - Therefore, the rate of water intake \( R \) is:
     \[
     R = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water taken on:**
   - The total amount of water \( W \) taken on is the product of the rate of water intake and the total distance rowed:
     \[
     W = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is \(\boxed{16}\) liters."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - Therefore, \( 1800 = 6B \).

2. **Solve for \( B \):**
   \[
   B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]
   So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

3. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( D \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 300 = 50D \).

4. **Solve for \( D \):**
   \[
   D = \frac{300}{50} = 6
   \]
   So, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph.

5. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - Since the problem states ""ducks at the zoo"" and the number of birds in the photograph is 6, we assume these 6 birds are ducks.
   - Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $16.
   - Sasha has 5 of these boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards: \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80 \).

3. **Total original cost:**
   - Total cost for all boards: \( \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \).

Next, let's calculate the new prices after the 50% increase.

4. **New price of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Original price: $10.
   - Increase: \( 50\% \) of $10 = \( 0.50 \times \$10 = \$5 \).
   - New price: \( \$10 + \$5 = \$15 \).

5. **New price of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Original price: $16.
   - Increase: \( 50\% \) of $16 = \( 0.50 \times \$16 = \$8 \).
   - New price: \( \$16 + \$8 = \$24 \).

Now, let's calculate the total selling price.

6. **Total selling price of 2x4x10 boards:**

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{90}\)."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total amount of sugar and water used. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total parts of the mixture (sugar + water) is \(7 + 13 = 20\) parts.

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. This total corresponds to the 20 parts in the ratio. To find the value of one part, we divide the total amount by the total number of parts:

\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

Since the amount of sugar used corresponds to 7 parts in the ratio, we can find the total amount of sugar by multiplying the value of one part by 7:

\[
\text{Amount of sugar} = 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is \(\boxed{42}\)."

   \]

2. Next, calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs by the cost per pair:
   \[
   6 \text{ pairs} \times 60 \text{ dollars/pair} = 360 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid is:
\[
\boxed{360}

"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vehicles in the 2 containers imported on the first day.
2. Determine the number of additional vehicles that were imported on the second day.
3. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day based on the number of additional vehicles.

First, we calculate the total number of vehicles in the 2 containers imported on the first day:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

Next, we know the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. Therefore, the number of additional vehicles imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23 \).

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is \( 40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \).

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Since both salaries increased simultaneously by the same percentage, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Lylah's new salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.4 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Adrien's new salary is $56,000.
   - Lylah's new salary is approximately $43,076.92.
   - Therefore, the total salary is \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \).

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\)."

"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday:**
   Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday each day.
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours per day}
   \]
   Therefore, for both Tuesday and Wednesday:
   \[
   6 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:**
   Sadie slept 1 hour more than the 6 hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   \[
   6 + 1 = 7 \text{ hours per day}
   \]
   Therefore, for the remaining 4 days:

   - Time already used: 3 hours
   - Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours
   - Speed for the remaining time: 5 miles per hour
   - Distance covered in the remaining 4 hours = Speed × Time = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

3. **Total distance:**
   - Distance covered in the first 3 hours + Distance covered in the remaining 4 hours = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is **50 miles**."
"First, let's determine how many letters Jennie put stamps on. She put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. We calculate this as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters. These 20 letters are now part of the pile of already-stamped letters. Initially, there were some letters already in the pile of already-stamped letters. Let's denote the number of letters already in the pile of already-stamped letters as \( x \). After Jennie added 20 more letters to the pile, the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters became 30. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
x + 20 = 30
\]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[
x = 30 - 20 = 10
\]

So, there were initially 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. The final answer is:

"Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

Initially, Julia bought a package of \( x \) spoons. Her husband then gave her an additional package of 5 spoons. So, the total number of spoons she had before using any was:
\[ x + 5 \]

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons left after sampling is:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 \]

According to the problem, after using 3 spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by isolating \( x \):
\[ x + 2 - 2 = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is \(\boxed{10}\)."

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is:

\[
\boxed{20\%}

"Let's define the variables for the different types of bees:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, we can express \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
- Since \( B = 2Q \),
- And \( W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

Now substitute \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we have \( Q \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."
"First, let's determine how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we calculate:

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we calculate:

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items from the list:

- Milk: $2 (food)
- Eggs: $3 (food)
- Light bulbs: $3 (non-food)
- Cups: $3 (non-food)
- Roach traps: $4 (non-food)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the food items:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

The tax on the non-food items is 10%, so we calculate the tax amount:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Adding the tax to the non-food items' total cost:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final total cost is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

\[ 3 \text{ (current clients)} + 5 \text{ (potential clients)} = 8 \text{ clients} \]

Next, we determine the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths needed:

\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles of bleach per client} = 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \]
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack of cloths per client} = 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the bleach and cloths:

\[ 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} = \$32 \]
\[ 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$40 \]

Adding these together gives the total expenses:

\[ \$32 + \$40 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare per year:**
   - John has 100 pineapples per hectare.
   - He can harvest every 3 months, which means he can harvest 4 times a year (since there are 12 months in a year and \(12 \div 3 = 4\)).
   - Therefore, the number of pineapples per hectare per year is \(100 \times 4 = 400\).

2. **Calculate the total number of pineapples for 10 hectares:**
   - John has 10 hectares.
   - Each hectare yields 400 pineapples per year.
   - Therefore, the total number of pineapples for 10 hectares is \(10 \times 400 = 4000\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4000}
\]"
"To determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and then sum them up.

1. The first box contains 500 pieces.
2. The second box contains 3 times more pieces than the first box. Therefore, the number of pieces in the second box is:
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500
   \]
3. The third box contains \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces of the first box. Therefore, the number of pieces in the third box is:
   \[
   \frac{500}{4} = 125
   \]

Now, we sum the pieces from all three boxes:
\[
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125
\]

Thus, the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up is:
\[
\boxed{2125}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees \( \frac{1}{2} \) of 30 bees return.
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees return.

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees two times as many bees as she saw leave in the first 6 hours.
   - \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave the hive.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left in the first 6 hours and didn't return by the last 6 hours are \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) bees.
   - These 15 bees return in the last 6 hours.

So, the number of bees Debra sees return to the hive in the last 6 hours is \( \boxed{15} \)."
"To determine how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the tickets.
2. Add the change received to the total cost to find the amount given.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets:
- The cost of one adult ticket is $12.
- The cost of one child ticket is $10.
- Therefore, the total cost for one adult ticket and one child ticket is:
  \[
  12 + 10 = 22 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we know that Brittany's mom received $8 in change. To find out how much money she gave the cashier, we add the change to the total cost of the tickets:
\[
22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has and then use that information to find out how many friends James has.

1. Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

2. According to the problem, Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. We know Charlie has 12 friends, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   3D = 12
   \]

3. Solving for \( D \):
   \[
   D = \frac{12}{3} = 4
   \]
   So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

4. James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Therefore, the number of friends James has is:
   \[
   4D = 4 \times 4 = 16
   \]

Thus, James has \(\boxed{16}\) Facebook friends."
"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in their times is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting for the loser (Tim) for \(\boxed{4}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the number of tires Shawnda inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we add up all the tires inflated:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost in cents is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar):
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of cookies Carl buys. Since he buys ten packs and each pack contains six cookies, we calculate the total number of cookies as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies per pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of these 60 cookies. Since each cookie costs $0.10, the total cost is:

\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars per cookie} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars} - 6 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the change Carl receives is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's work backwards through the problem step by step.

1. **Final state**: There are 5 fries left.
2. **Before the ants carried off the final fry**: There were \(5 + 1 = 6\) fries.
3. **Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries**: Let \(x\) be the number of fries before the raccoon took some. The raccoon took \(\frac{2}{3}x\), leaving \(\frac{1}{3}x = 6\). So, \(x = 6 \times 3 = 18\).
4. **Before the three pigeons ate their share**: Each pigeon ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. Therefore, there were \(18 + 9 = 27\) fries before the pigeons ate.
5. **Before the seagull ate its share**: The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) fries. Therefore, there were \(27 + 7 = 34\) fries before the seagull ate.
6. **Initial state**: Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull took the pack. So, the pack originally had \(34 + 14 = 48\) fries.

The number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes each week.

**Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:**
- Kimo has 3 classes each day.
- Each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, each of these days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in classes.

Since he has classes on 3 days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total for these days is:
\[3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ hours}\]

**Tuesday and Thursday:**
- Kimo has 2 classes each day.
- Each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, each of these days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in classes.

Since he has classes on 2 days (Tuesday and Thursday), the total for these days is:
\[4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ hours}\]

**Total hours per week:**
Adding the hours from all the days, we get:
\[9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\]

**Total hours in one semester:**
- There are 16 weeks in the semester.
- Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes in one semester is:
\[17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\]

**Final Answer:**
\[272\]"
"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches:

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \( 300 \times 4 = 1200 \) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each baguette is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) inches long.
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \( 60 \times 24 = 1440 \) inches.

Next, we sum the total lengths in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches (rolls)} + 720 \text{ inches (croissants)} + 1440 \text{ inches (baguettes)} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet:
\[ 3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is:

"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. The football field is 100 yards long, and Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Each back-and-forth trip is 200 yards (100 yards to the other end and 100 yards back).

\[ \text{Distance Blake runs} = 15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back), and she does this 34 times.

\[ \text{Distance Kelly runs} = 34 \times 80 \text{ yards} = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. Since Blake runs more, we subtract the distance Kelly runs from the distance Blake runs.

\[ \text{Difference in distance} = 3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."

"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, so the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6. This gives us:

\[ 11 + 6 = 17 \]

Next, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2. This gives us:

\[ 17 - 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find the tank's water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the water depth on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the water depth on Wednesday based on the depth on Tuesday.

**Step 1: Determine the water depth on Tuesday.**

The water depth on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Therefore, the water depth on Tuesday is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the water depth on Wednesday.**

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

**Anakin's Catch:**
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total for Anakin:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

**Locsin's Catch:**
- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin, so \( 10 - 5 = 5 \)
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin, so \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin, so \( 3 + 2 = 5 \)

Total for Locsin:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

**Total Fish Caught by Both:**

So, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price \( P_0 = \$20 \)
   - Increase rate every two months: 20% of the original price, which is \( 0.20 \times 20 = \$4 \)

2. **Determine the number of increases over 36 months:**
   - Since the price increases every two months, the number of increases in 36 months is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).

3. **Calculate the price after each increase:**
   - Each increase adds \$4 to the price. Therefore, after 18 increases, the total increase in price is \( 18 \times 4 = \$72 \).

4. **Find the final price:**
   - The final price after 36 months is the original price plus the total increase, which is \( 20 + 72 = \$92 \).

Thus, the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{92}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and use the given information to form equations.

Let:
- \( R \) be the cost of one red car.
- \( A \) be the cost of one action figure.
- \( D \) be the cost of the doll.

From the problem, we know:
1. One red car costs $4, so \( R = 4 \).
2. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so \( D = 3A \).
3. An action figure costs $5, so \( A = 5 \).

Now, we can substitute the known values into the equations:
- Since \( A = 5 \), the doll's cost \( D \) is \( D = 3 \times 5 = 15 \).

Next, we need to find the total cost of all the toys in the room:
- There are 5 red cars, each costing $4, so the total cost for the red cars is \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \).
- There are 3 action figures, each costing $5, so the total cost for the action figures is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \).
- The doll costs $15.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total cost of all the toys is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. **Calculate the lost income from doing taxes herself:**
   - Jackie loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She will lose 3 hours of work.

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she is purchasing and then subtract this from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Next, we add these costs together to find the total expenditure:
\[
1090 + 157 + 74 + 157 + 74 + 102
\]

We can add these step by step:
\[
1090 + 157 = 1247
\]
\[
1247 + 74 = 1321
\]
\[
1321 + 157 = 1478
\]
\[
1478 + 74 = 1552
\]
\[
1552 + 102 = 1654
\]

The total cost of the items is €1654. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by:
\[
1654 - 1500 = 154
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, we can find the total number of eggs needed by multiplying the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs per flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

\[ 45 \text{ eggs} \div 9 \text{ eggs per babysitting session} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( S \) be Seth's current age.
- Let \( B \) be Brooke's current age.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke. This can be written as:
   \[
   S = 2B
   \]
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be written as:
   \[
   (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
   \]
   Simplifying the equation, we get:
   \[
   S + B + 4 = 28
   \]
   Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
   \[
   S + B = 24
   \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[
2B + B = 24
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3B = 24
\]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[
B = 8
\]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[
S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

So, Seth is \(\boxed{16}\) years old."
"First, let's define the amount of money Ethel has. According to the problem, Ethel has $8.

Next, we need to determine how much money Jimmy has. The problem states that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ \text{Jimmy's money} = 2 \times (\text{Ethel's money}) + 2 \]

Substituting the amount of money Ethel has into the equation:

\[ \text{Jimmy's money} = 2 \times 8 + 2 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Jimmy's money} = 16 + 2 \]

Finally, add the numbers together:

\[ \text{Jimmy's money} = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has \(\boxed{18}\) dollars."

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - Pancho walks 20 miles each day.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Total miles walked on weekdays: \( 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Pancho walks 10 miles each day.
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - Total miles walked on weekends: \( 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Total miles walked in a week:**
   - Sum of miles walked on weekdays and weekends: \( 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the hat:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the hat} = \$25
   \]

2. **Cost of the jacket:**
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times \$25 = \$75
   \]

3. **Cost of the pants:**
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket.
   \[
   \text{Average cost} = \frac{\text{Cost of the hat} + \text{Cost of the jacket}}{2} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = \$50
   \]

4. **Total cost of the uniform:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the hat} + \text{Cost of the jacket} + \text{Cost of the pants} = 25 + 75 + 50 = \$150
   \]

Thus, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[
\boxed{150}
\]"
"To determine the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each type of invertebrate and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders:**
   - Number of spiders: 80
   - Legs per spider: 8
   - Total legs from spiders: \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \)

2. **Insects:**
   - Number of insects: 90
   - Legs per insect: 6
   - Total legs from insects: \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \)

3. **Rare mutant invertebrates:**
   - Number of rare mutant invertebrates: 3
   - Legs per rare mutant invertebrate: 10
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

Now, we sum the legs from all the invertebrates:
\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

Thus, the total number of legs Jake sees is \(\boxed{1210}\)."
"Let's define the ages of the birds as follows:
- Let \( S_2 \) be the age of Sally Two.
- Let \( G \) be the age of Granny Red.
- Let \( S_4 \) be the age of Sally Four.
- Let \( S_{32} \) be the age of Sally Thirtytwo.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, so \( S_{32} = 8 \).
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so \( S_4 = S_{32} = 8 \).
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so \( G = 2 \times S_4 = 2 \times 8 = 16 \).
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so \( S_2 = G + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19 \).

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by summing their ages:
\[ S_2 + G + S_4 + S_{32} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 41. \]

The total age of the four birds is \(\boxed{41}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make for all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment.

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, the final numerical answer is:

$18000"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to peel all the potatoes. Since it takes him about 1.5 minutes to peel each potato and he has 60 potatoes, the total time for peeling is:

\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to cut all the potatoes. Since it takes him about 5 seconds to cut each potato, the total time for cutting is:

\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent peeling and cutting the potatoes together:

\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:

\[ \boxed{95} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables and then proceed step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of gallons of lemonade they made.
   - The cost for lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.
   - The revenue from selling the lemonade is $0.50 per glass, and they get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = $10 \).

2. **Set Up the Profit Equation:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Total revenue = \( 10x \) (since they make $10 per gallon and they made \( x \) gallons).
   - Total cost = \( 5x \) (since it costs $5 per gallon and they made \( x \) gallons).
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = \( 10x - 5x = 5x \).

3. **Given Profit:**
   - We know the profit is $25.
   - So, we can set up the equation: \( 5x = 25 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \).
   - This means they made 5 gallons of lemonade.

5. **Calculate the Cost of Lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Since they made 5 gallons, the total cost of lemons is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \).

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Chinese participants in the race.
2. Subtract the number of boys on the Chinese team from the total number of Chinese participants to find the number of girls.

First, we know the total number of Asians in the race is 240, and out of these, 80 were Japanese. Therefore, the number of Chinese participants is:
\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:
\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel, and then determine how much he has left after these expenses.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after the donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining amount after giving money to his daughter and wife:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after giving to daughter and wife} = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the final amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:
\[
\boxed{350}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of crabs each person has and then find the total number of crabs.

1. **Determine the number of crabs Bo has:**
   Bo has 40 crabs.

2. **Determine the number of crabs Monic has:**
   Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of crabs Monic has} = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]

3. **Determine the number of crabs Rani has:**
   Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of crabs Rani has} = 36 + 10 = 46
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of crabs:**
   We add the number of crabs each person has:
   \[
   \text{Total number of crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46
   \]

5. **Perform the addition:**
   \[
   40 + 36 = 76

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[
\boxed{122}
\]"
"To determine how much Lloyd earned over the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate his earnings for the first week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the first week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours worked} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate his earnings for the second week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the second week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours worked} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks to find the total earnings:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings for the first week} + \text{Earnings for the second week} = 50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned \(\boxed{130}\) dollars for the first two weeks."
"First, we need to determine the number of votes the winner received. Since the winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes and the total number of students who voted was 80, we calculate the winner's votes as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{4} = \frac{240}{4} = 60
\]

Next, we need to find out how many votes the loser received. Since the total number of votes is 80 and the winner received 60 votes, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to establish the relationship between the quantities of different flowers ordered by Sandra.

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of white carnations ordered.
2. According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses ordered is \( 4C \).
3. Sandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   5C = 200
   \]
4. Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{200}{5} = 40
   \]
5. Now that we know \( C = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses ordered:
   \[
   4C = 4 \times 40 = 160
   \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{160}\) red roses by 5 pm."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( J \) be Jean's current age.
- Let \( M \) be Mark's current age.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Jean is two years older than Mark. This can be written as:
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]

2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. Since Jan is currently 30 years old, two years ago Jan was 28 years old. This can be written as:
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 + 5
   \]
   Simplifying the right side of the equation:
   \[
   M - 2 = 14 + 5 = 19
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   M - 2 = 19
   \]
   Adding 2 to both sides gives:
   \[
   M = 21
   \]

Now that we know Mark's current age is 21, we can find Jean's current age using the first equation:
\[
J = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Jean is \(\boxed{23}\) years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four runners, the total time for the faster team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/runner} \times 4 \text{ runners} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Therefore, the times for the four runners are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds
- Third runner: \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds
- Fourth runner: \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds

The total time for the less well-rounded team is:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the two teams is:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two independent events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the Probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probability is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row."
"To determine the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother, we start by identifying the number of apples each person picked.

1. Jenna's mother picked 20 apples.
2. Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. Therefore, we calculate the number of apples Jenna picked as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

Next, we add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother to find the total number of apples picked:
\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} + \text{Number of apples her mother picked} = 10 + 20 = 30
\]

Thus, the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the information given.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
- There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
- Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).

Next, let's consider the hamsters:
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
- Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage. Since each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, the total straw given to the hamsters is \( 10h \times 5 = 50h \).

Finally, let's consider the rabbits:
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total amount of straw distributed is the sum of the straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces of straw. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50h + 20 = 160 \]

We need to find the value of \( r \). To do this, we need to determine the value of \( h \). However, the problem does not provide enough information to determine \( h \) directly. Instead, we can isolate \( 18r \) in the equation:
\[ 18r + 50h + 20 = 160 \]
\[ 18r + 50h = 140 \]

Since the problem only asks for the number of rats in each cage, we need to find a value of \( r \) that makes \( 50h \) an integer and satisfies the equation. Let's test possible values for \( r \):

If \( r = 5 \):
\[ 18(5) + 50h = 140 \]
\[ 90 + 50h = 140 \]
\[ 50h = 50 \]
\[ h = 1 \]

This value of \( r = 5 \) works, and it is a reasonable solution because it results in an integer value for \( h \). Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the simple interest for each month and then add it to the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal amount (P) is $100, the monthly interest rate (R) is 2% (or 0.02 as a decimal), and the time (T) is 3 months.

First, we calculate the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest for one month} = 100 \times 0.02 \times 1 = 2 \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, we need to calculate the interest for each of the 3 months and add it to the principal.

For the first month:
\[ \text{Interest} = 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]
The total amount after the first month is:
\[ 100 + 2 = 102 \]

For the second month, the principal is now $102:
\[ \text{Interest} = 102 \times 0.02 = 2.04 \]
The total amount after the second month is:
\[ 102 + 2.04 = 104.04 \]

For the third month, the principal is now $104.04:
\[ \text{Interest} = 104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808 \]
The total amount after the third month is:
\[ 104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict is:
\[ \boxed{106.12} \]"
"To determine how many bags of wheat the trader sold, we need to set up and solve a linear equation based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

1. **Cost of buying the wheat:**
   - The cost per bag is $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for \( x \) bags is \( 20x \).

2. **Cost of transporting the wheat:**
   - The transportation cost per bag is $2.
   - Therefore, the total transportation cost for \( x \) bags is \( 2x \).

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost for buying and transporting the wheat is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \).

4. **Revenue from selling the wheat:**
   - The selling price per bag is $30.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is \( 30x \).

5. **Profit:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - The trader made a total profit of $400.
   - Therefore, the profit equation is:
     \[
     30x - 22x = 400
     \]

6. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   8x = 400
   \]

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{400}{8} = 50
   \]

Thus, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine how many peaches John collects, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends collecting peaches.
2. Determine how many peaches he collects per minute.
3. Multiply the total number of minutes by the number of peaches collected per minute.

First, we know that John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total number of minutes as follows:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches collected is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly requirement of insects for the flock.
2. Convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement.

First, we find the total weekly requirement of insects for the flock. Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week and there are 10 ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total weekly requirement by 7:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos on Friday morning:**
   Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Number of flamingos taken back on Saturday morning:**
   The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   \[
   \text{Number of flamingos taken back} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
   \]

3. **Number of pink flamingos left on Saturday morning:**
   \[
   \text{Number of pink flamingos left} = 18 - 6 = 12
   \]

4. **Number of white flamingos added on Saturday morning:**
   The neighbors painted the 6 taken back flamingos white and put them back.
   \[
   \text{Number of white flamingos} = 6
   \]

5. **Number of pink flamingos added on Sunday morning:**
   The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   \[
   \text{Number of pink flamingos on Sunday morning} = 12 + 18 = 30
   \]

6. **Number of white flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   The number of white flamingos remains the same as they were added on Saturday.
   \[
   \text{Number of white flamingos} = 6
   \]

7. **Difference between the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 30 - 6 = 24
   \]

Thus, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos. 

**Final Answer:**
\[

"First, let's determine the cost of one pen. According to the problem, a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the cost of one pen as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. Since each pen costs $1.50, the total cost for 8 pens is:

\[
\text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{12.00}

"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants.
2. Subtract the distributed amount from the total amount of carrots available.

First, we calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds per restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we subtract the distributed amount from the total amount of carrots available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

The total population of Soda is 23,786. The number of men is 8,417 and the number of women is 9,092. We can calculate the number of children as follows:

1. Add the number of men and women:
   \[
   8417 + 9092 = 17509
   \]

2. Subtract this sum from the total population to find the number of children:
   \[
   23786 - 17509 = 6277
   \]

So, the number of children in Soda is \(\boxed{6277}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards Collected in the First Month:**
   She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Cards Collected in the Second Month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

4. **Cards Collected in the Third Month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

5. **Total Number of Cards:**
   Now, we sum up all the cards she had initially and the cards she collected over the three months.
   \[
   20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320
   \]

So, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of sentences edited for each publisher:**
   - Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher.
   - Total sentences edited per week = 1000.
   - Therefore, sentences edited for Publisher A = sentences edited for Publisher B = \( \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \) sentences.

2. **Determine the payment rates:**
   - Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
   - Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) cents per sentence.

3. **Calculate the total earnings from each publisher:**
   - Earnings from Publisher A = \( 500 \) sentences \(\times\) 5 cents/sentence = \( 500 \times 5 = 2500 \) cents.
   - Earnings from Publisher B = \( 500 \) sentences \(\times\) 10 cents/sentence = \( 500 \times 10 = 5000 \) cents.

4. **Calculate the total earnings per week:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from Publisher A + Earnings from Publisher B = \( 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \) cents.

Therefore, Mark makes \(\boxed{7500}\) cents in a week."

So, the total amount of water Baldur gets every day is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"First, let's calculate John's annual salary before the raise. Since he makes $2000 per week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary is:
\[ 2000 \times 52 = 104000 \]

Next, we need to calculate the new salary after the 5% raise. A 5% raise on his annual salary of $104000 is:
\[ 104000 \times 0.05 = 5200 \]
So, his new annual salary is:
\[ 104000 + 5200 = 109200 \]

Now, we add the one-time bonus of $5000 to his new annual salary:
\[ 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the cheese usage for each part.

1. **Cheese used for sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for sandwiches is:
     \[
     2 \text{ slices/sandwich} \times 7 \text{ sandwiches} = 14 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices per omelet.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for omelets is:
     \[
     3 \text{ slices/omelet} \times 3 \text{ omelets} = 9 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for macaroni and cheese is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the current scores and the desired average:**
   - Scores on the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86.
   - Desired average: 93.
   - Number of tests: 6.
   - Since the lowest score can be removed, we will consider the best five scores for the average calculation.

2. **Calculate the sum of the best five scores:**
   - The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.
   - The lowest score is 71.
   - Sum of the remaining scores: \(89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367\).

3. **Set up the equation for the desired average:**
   - Let \(x\) be the score on the sixth test.
   - The sum of the best five scores including the sixth test will be \(367 + x\).
   - The average of these five scores is given by \(\frac{367 + x}{5} = 93\).

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 5:
   \[
   367 + x = 465
   \]
   Subtract 367 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 98
   \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score \(\boxed{98}\) on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93."
"To find out how many kilometers Micheal rode in total, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

First, calculate the total kilometers for one week:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 125 \text{ kilometers/week} \]

Next, calculate the total kilometers for four weeks:
\[ 125 \text{ kilometers/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ kilometers} \]

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

First, calculate the total kilometers for one week:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 120 \text{ kilometers/week} \]

Next, calculate the total kilometers for three weeks:
\[ 120 \text{ kilometers/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ kilometers} \]

**Total Kilometers:**
Now, add the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks:
\[ 500 \text{ kilometers} + 360 \text{ kilometers} = 860 \text{ kilometers} \]

So, the total number of kilometers Micheal did is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"First, let's determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of each candied apple by dividing the weight of a chocolate bar by 2:

\[
\text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g}
\]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, and each chocolate bar weighs 40g:

\[
\text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g}
\]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. Joe has 80 candied apples, and each candied apple weighs 20g:

\[
\text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g}
\]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[
\text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g}
\]

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:

\[
\boxed{2600}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday:**
   - Rose bought 4 cakes.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday.
   - Number of cakes on Tuesday = \(3 \times 4 = 12\).

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
   - Number of cakes on Wednesday = \(5 \times 12 = 60\).

Now, we sum the number of cakes bought over the three days:
- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

Total number of cakes = \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{76}

"Let's denote the cost of one cup as \( C \) and the cost of one plate as \( P \).

From the problem, we know:
- The cost of twenty dozen cups is \( 240C \) (since 20 dozen equals 240 cups).
- The cost of half a dozen plates is \( 6P \) (since half a dozen equals 6 plates).

According to the problem, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. This can be written as:
\[ 240C = 6P - 1200 \]

We are also given that the cost of one plate is $6000:
\[ P = 6000 \]

Substituting \( P = 6000 \) into the equation \( 240C = 6P - 1200 \):
\[ 240C = 6 \times 6000 - 1200 \]
\[ 240C = 36000 - 1200 \]
\[ 240C = 34800 \]

To find the cost of one cup, we divide both sides of the equation by 240:
\[ C = \frac{34800}{240} \]
\[ C = 145 \]

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.

Now, let's consider the money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn.
- Each time she mows the lawn, she earns $4, so her total earnings from mowing the lawn are \(4x\) dollars.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money Sara has before she mows the lawn is \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars. To find out how much more money she needs to afford the jacket and shoes, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

This $40 is the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn. Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we set up the equation:
\[ 4x = 40 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of eggs produced per day is 42.
2. The number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens.

We can express these as equations:
1. The total number of eggs produced per day is given by the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]
2. The relationship between the number of white and red chickens is:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( r \):
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]
Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]
\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]
Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[
8r = 32
\]
Divide both sides by 8:
\[
r = 4
\]

So, the number of red chickens is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"First, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle, which represents the distance Gary walks. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Given:
- Distance = 15 miles
- Speed = 3 miles/hour

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers counted on the first day.
2. Calculate the number of customers counted on the second day.
3. Use the total number of customers over the three days to find the number of customers on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

Next, on the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of customers counted on the third day. According to the problem, the total number of customers over the three days is 500. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 250 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of differential equations to model the water levels in both pools over time, given the leak rates and the initial conditions.

Let's define:
- \( B(t) \) as the amount of water in the big pool at time \( t \) (in minutes).
- \( S(t) \) as the amount of water in the small pool at time \( t \) (in minutes).

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the differential equations for the water levels in the pools are:
\[ \frac{dB}{dt} = -4 \]
\[ \frac{dS}{dt} = -4 \]

We are given two conditions:
1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's denote the current time as \( t = 0 \). Then, 4 minutes ago, the time was \( t = -4 \).

From the first condition:
\[ B(-4) = 2S(-4) \]

From the second condition:
\[ B(0) = 4S(0) \]

Since both pools are leaking at the same rate, the amount of water in each pool at any time \( t \) can be expressed as:
\[ B(t) = B(0) - 4t \]
\[ S(t) = S(0) - 4t \]

Using the second condition at \( t = 0 \):
\[ B(0) = 4S(0) \]

Using the first condition at \( t = -4 \):
\[ B(-4) = B(0) + 16 \]
\[ S(-4) = S(0) + 16 \]
\[ B(-4) = 2S(-4) \]
\[ B(0) + 16 = 2(S(0) + 16) \]
\[ B(0) + 16 = 2S(0) + 32 \]
\[ B(0) = 2S(0) + 16 \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B(0) = 4S(0) \)
2. \( B(0) = 2S(0) + 16 \)

Setting these equal to each other:
\[ 4S(0) = 2S(0) + 16 \]
\[ 2S(0) = 16 \]
\[ S(0) = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has:
\[ S(0) = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool now is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months at $165 per month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Finally, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of dahlias in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

\[ \text{Number of dahlias} = \text{Number of roses} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of flowers in the vase by adding the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15 \]

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information given.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(2 \times 21 = 42\) years.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(3 \times 21 = 63\) years.

Next, we need to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years.
- Zack's age in three years will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years.
- Adrian's age in three years will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years.

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how many points Jojo scored, we need to first calculate the points scored by each of the other three students: Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna.

1. **Naomi's Points:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Points:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. First, we calculate half of Naomi's points:
   \[
   \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   Then, we add 10 to this value:
   \[
   34 + 10 = 44
   \]
   So, Yuri scored 44 points.

3. **Brianna's Points:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Therefore:
   \[
   68 + 17 = 85
   \]
   So, Brianna scored 85 points.

4. **Total Points:**
   The total points scored by all four students is 251. We can now find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
   \[
   251 - (68 + 44 + 85)
   \]
   First, we calculate the sum of the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 = 197
   \]
   Then, we subtract this sum from the total points:
   \[
   251 - 197 = 54
   \]

Therefore, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent solving puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on Sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is:
  \[
  10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one Sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 Sudoku puzzles.

"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of card after the changes:

- **Fire type**: 30 (unchanged)
- **Grass type**: 20 + 14 = 34
- **Water type**: 40 - 8 = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of cards James has after these changes:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \text{ cards} \]

Now, we need to find the probability that a randomly picked card is a water type. This is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:

"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, their combined rate is \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360.

To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

**Final Answer:**

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens (since 25 divided by 5 is 5).

   Now, Ram has 25 (original pens) - 25 (used pens) + 5 (new pens) = 5 pens.

3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: He can now use these 5 pens to make 1 new pen (since 5 divided by 5 is 1).

   Now, Ram has 5 (remaining pens) - 5 (used pens) + 1 (new pen) = 1 pen.

4. **Third Cycle of Refilling**: He can use this 1 pen to make 0 new pens (since 1 is less than 5).

So, after all the cycles, Ram is left with 1 pen. However, we need to count all the pens he has had at any point, not just the final number of pens he is left with.

- Initially, he had 25 pens.
- After the first cycle, he had 5 pens.
- After the second cycle, he had 1 pen.

Adding these up, the total number of pens he has had is 25 (initial) + 5 (after first cycle) + 1 (after second cycle) = 31 pens.

Thus, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is \(\boxed{31}\)."

   Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

4. **Sum of the Ages:**
   Now, we sum the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa.
   \[
   \text{Sum of the ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20 = 68

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Determine the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Determine the number of students who went out through exit C by subtracting the students who went out through exits A and B from the total number of students.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.**

30% of 1000 students went out through exit A:
\[ 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.**

\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B.**

3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

**Step 4: Determine the number of students who went out through exit C.**

The rest of the students went out through exit C. So, we subtract the students who went out through exits A and B from the total number of students:

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

Given that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so the number of candies James has is:
\[ R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. John has 54 candies, and James has 33 candies. The difference is:
\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

Final answer:

"To determine the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora, we need to consider the books each of them reads.

1. Dolly has 2 books. If Dolly reads her own books and also reads Pandora's book, she will read:
   - Her 2 books
   - Pandora's 1 book

   So, Dolly will read \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

2. Pandora has 1 book. If Pandora reads her own book and also reads Dolly's books, she will read:
   - Her 1 book
   - Dolly's 2 books

   So, Pandora will read \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

Since the problem asks for the total number of books read collectively, we add the number of books read by Dolly and Pandora:
\[3 + 3 = 6\]

Thus, the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora collectively is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike still has after stopping contact with 2 of them:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of letters Mike receives from his remaining pen pals each week:
\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal per week} = 6 \text{ letters per week} \]

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages Mike needs to write in response is:
\[ 6 \text{ letters} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages} \]

Given that Mike writes a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is:
\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( S_1 \) be the number of snails in the first aquarium.
- Let \( S_2 \) be the number of snails in the second aquarium.
- Let \( F \) be the number of fish in each aquarium.

From the problem, we know:
- \( S_1 = 4 \)
- \( S_2 = 32 \)
- The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.

The difference in the number of snails is:
\[ S_2 - S_1 = 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To determine how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

1. **Determine the number of cougars killed today:**
   - Last night, Rick killed 15 cougars.
   - Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than last night.
   - Therefore, the number of cougars killed today is:
     \[
     15 - 3 = 12
     \]

2. **Determine the number of wolves killed today:**
   - Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.

"First, we identify Bill's starting floor, which is the 3rd floor. According to the problem, Bill rides the elevator to a floor that is equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Target floor} = 4 \times \text{Starting floor} + 6 \]

Substituting the starting floor (3) into the equation:

\[ \text{Target floor} = 4 \times 3 + 6 \]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Then, we add 6 to the result:

\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \]

So, the floor Bill is on now is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

To find 30% of Mitchel's times:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, which means:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Anne went down the slide 21 times.

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times, Robert went down the slide:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the total number of cows initially present in the ten stalls. Since each of the ten stalls has 20 cows, the total number of cows is:

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the twenty stalls. The number of new cows added to each stall is:
\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \]

So, after adding the new cows, the number of cows in each stall is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

We need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each of the twenty stalls now has 22 cows, the number of cows in 8 stalls is:
\[ 8 \times 22 = 176 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{176} \]"
"To determine how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill separately and then sum these values.

1. **Pennies:**
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Total value of pennies: \( 100 \times 0.01 = 1.00 \) dollars.

2. **Nickels:**
   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Total value of nickels: \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2.00 \) dollars.

3. **Dimes:**
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Total value of dimes: \( 20 \times 0.10 = 2.00 \) dollars.

"First, let's determine the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[
\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any part of it. Since each section weighs 400 pounds:

\[
20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much of the redwood was eaten by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the redwood, so they ate:

\[
0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the remaining weight of the redwood, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the original weight:

\[
8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the final weight of the redwood is:

\[
5600 \text{ pounds}

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( A_a \) be the number of apples Andrea has.
- Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of bananas Andrea has.
- Let \( J_b \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \).
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \).
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
4. Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_a = 52 \).

First, substitute \( A_a = 52 \) into the first equation to find \( J_a \):
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( J_a = 44 \) into the third equation to find \( J_b \):
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Next, use the value of \( J_b \) to find \( A_b \):
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Now, we can find the total number of fruits:
- Andrea's total fruits: \( A_a + A_b = 52 + 24 = 76 \)
- Jamal's total fruits: \( J_a + J_b = 44 + 48 = 92 \)

The total number of fruits is:
\[ 76 + 92 = 168 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we need to find out how many cups of flour are required for the cookies she is making today. Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies as follows:
\[
\text{Cups of flour for 36 cookies} = \frac{36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies per dozen}} \times 2 \text{ cups} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of flour needed for the 30 cookies she is making tomorrow. Using the same ratio:
\[
\text{Cups of flour for 30 cookies} = \frac{30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies per dozen}} \times 2 \text{ cups} = 2.5 \times 2 = 5 \text{ cups}
\]

Now, we add the amounts of flour needed for both days to find the total amount of flour required:
\[
\text{Total cups of flour} = 6 \text{ cups} + 5 \text{ cups} = 11 \text{ cups}
\]

Thus, the total number of cups of flour Carla will need is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of pennies in the stack.
2. Convert the number of pennies to dollars.

First, we calculate the number of pennies in the stack. The stack contains two-thirds of the 9,300 pennies in the cup. We can find this by multiplying 9,300 by \(\frac{2}{3}\):

\[
9300 \times \frac{2}{3} = 9300 \times 0.6667 = 6200
\]

So, the stack contains 6,200 pennies.

Next, we convert the number of pennies to dollars. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we divide 6,200 by 100:

\[
6200 \div 100 = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is \(\boxed{62}\)."

   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{9500}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

1. **Transfer Fees:**
   - Transfer fees amount to 3% of the selling price.
   - Selling price = $400,000.
   - Transfer fees = \( 3\% \times 400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \).

2. **Brokerage Fee:**
   - Brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Brokerage fee = \( 5\% \times 400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \).

3. **Total Additional Costs:**
   - Total additional costs = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee.
   - Total additional costs = \( 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \).

4. **Net Proceeds Calculation:**

\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both types of holes to get the total time in minutes:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be their current sum of ages plus 10 years each. Since their current sum of ages is 20, in 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, the total additional years to their current sum will be \(10 + 10 = 20\).

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[20 + 20 = 40\]

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information that can be translated into equations.

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. Since \( R = 6S \), we substitute \( 6S \) for \( R \) in the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, we can find Ruby's age and check the conditions:
- If \( S = 6 \), then \( R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36 \).
- In 9 years, Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) and Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \).
- Check if Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam in 9 years: \( 45 = 3 \times 15 \), which is true.

The solution is correct. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- The total cost for the popsicles is \( 20 \times 0.25 \).

\[
20 \times 0.25 = 5
\]

So, the cost of the popsicles is $5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- The total cost for the ice cream bars is \( 4 \times 0.50 \).

\[
4 \times 0.50 = 2
\]

So, the cost of the ice cream bars is $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:

\[
5 + 2 = 7
\]

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is \(\boxed{7}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of spots on a mamba.
2. Calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras.
3. Calculate the total number of spots on all the mambas.
4. Find the combined total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas.
5. Find half of the combined total number of spots.

**Step 1: Determine the number of spots on a mamba.**
The cobra has 70 spots, and it has twice as many spots as a mamba. Therefore, the number of spots on a mamba is:
\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras.**
There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. Therefore, the total number of spots on all the cobras is:
\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of spots on all the mambas.**
There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. Therefore, the total number of spots on all the mambas is:
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

**Step 4: Find the combined total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas.**
The combined total number of spots is the sum of the spots on all the cobras and all the mambas:
\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

**Step 5: Find half of the combined total number of spots.**
Half of the combined total number of spots is:
\[ \text{Half of the combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people at the soccer game. We start with the team members and coaches:

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests per team member} = 24 \text{ guests} \]

Now, we add the team members, coaches, and guests to find the total number of people:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people per pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the pizzas. Each pizza costs $15, so:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars per pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Maddy will spend:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"
"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   \[
   \text{Total length of topaz gemstones} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of each necklace is 25 inches.
   - Subtract the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length.
   \[
   \text{Remaining length for sterling silver beads} = 25 - 8 = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads needed:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is \(\frac{1}{4}\) inch long.
   - To find the number of beads, divide the remaining length by the length of one bead.
   \[
   \text{Number of sterling silver beads} = \frac{17}{\frac{1}{4}} = 17 \times 4 = 68
   \]

Thus, Katerina uses \(\boxed{68}\) sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week.
2. Add the number of stories written in the first week to the number of stories written in the second week for each person.
3. Sum the total number of stories written by all three.

First, let's determine the number of stories each person wrote in the second week. Since they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:

- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Next, we add the number of stories written in the first week to the number of stories written in the second week for each person:

- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

Finally, we sum the total number of stories written by all three:

\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"First, determine Ann's brother's current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Ann's brother is currently 18 years old. To find out how old he will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]

Therefore, in 3 years, Ann's brother will be \(\boxed{21}\) years old."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

- Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is \(5 \times 25 = 125\) cents.
- Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) cents.

Adding these together, the total amount of money Kelly has is \(125 + 20 = 145\) cents.

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money Kelly has. The can of pop costs 55 cents.

So, the amount of money Kelly will have left after buying the can of pop is \(145 - 55 = 90\) cents.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the first five rows:
\[24 + 12 = 36\]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. To find out how many stars are in the rows of 5 stars, we subtract the number of stars in the first five rows from the total number of stars:
\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Now, we need to determine how many rows of 5 stars make up these 40 stars. We do this by dividing 40 by 5:
\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

So, the number of rows of 5 stars is:
\[\boxed{8}\]"
"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, with each truck carrying a maximum of 2000 pounds, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine how many trucks are needed:**
   Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks}
   \]

Since the division results in a whole number, no additional trucks are needed beyond the 3 calculated.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at 30 miles per hour and the distance is the same (480 miles), we can calculate the time it took for the slow lane car to cover the same distance:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate the number of medals Izzy has as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals of Ali and Izzy} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means that the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Let's denote the total number of medals given out for counting as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x = 10 \times 39 \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[ x = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since there are 8 packets and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get. With 4 adults each getting 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars each child will get is:
\[ \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]

So, each child will get \(\boxed{2}\) chocolate bars."
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works without breaks. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.

Next, we account for the 30-minute break she takes. This means the actual working time is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we convert the working time into minutes to match the rate given:
\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. To find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we first determine how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:
\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 per interval, her total earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Susan earns:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Points:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.
   - Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim's total remains 18 points.
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike's points: 22
   - Jim's points: 18
   - Tony's points: 43

Adding these together, the total points for all three players is:
\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{83}
\]"
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son will wash:
- The oldest son will wash as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges.
- The youngest son will wash as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges.

Now, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will originally bought 15 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of each activity Darren does on the second day:

- **Pushups**: On the first day, he does 100 pushups. On the second day, he does 20 more than on the first day.
  \[
  100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pushups}
  \]

- **Squats**: On the first day, he does 50 squats. On the second day, he does 10 fewer squats.
  \[
  50 - 10 = 40 \text{ squats}
  \]

- **Dumbbell presses**: On the first day, he does 20 dumbbell presses. On the second day, he doubles the number of dumbbell presses.
  \[
  20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dumbbell presses}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of each activity over the two days:

- **Total pushups**:
  \[
  100 \text{ (first day)} + 120 \text{ (second day)} = 220 \text{ pushups}
  \]

- **Total squats**:
  \[
  50 \text{ (first day)} + 40 \text{ (second day)} = 90 \text{ squats}
  \]

- **Total dumbbell presses**:
  \[
  20 \text{ (first day)} + 40 \text{ (second day)} = 60 \text{ dumbbell presses}
  \]

Finally, we sum up all the activities to get the total count:

\[
220 \text{ pushups} + 90 \text{ squats} + 60 \text{ dumbbell presses} = 370
\]

Thus, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{370}

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily rice consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner).
   - Therefore, each person consumes \(0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day}\).
   - For 5 people, the total daily consumption is \(0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 2 \, \text{kg/day}\).

2. **Calculate the total weekly rice consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly consumption is \(2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week}\).

3. **Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - The total amount of rice is 42 kg.
   - The weekly consumption is 14 kg.
   - Therefore, the number of weeks the rice will last is \(\frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}\).

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Monday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Tuesday: 15 crates.
- Wednesday: 12 crates.
- Thursday: 18 crates.
- Friday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Saturday: 20 crates.
- Sunday: 20 crates.

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Sunday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 + 20 = 85 \]

So, Sam sold a total of 85 crates during the week. His target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 85 = 35 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by \(\boxed{35}\) crates from his target for the week."

"To determine the total annual cost for John's driving service, we need to calculate the cost based on the miles driven and the monthly bonus, then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the total miles driven in a year:**
   - John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, which is 60 miles each day.
   - He works 5 days a week and there are 50 weeks in a year.
   - Therefore, the total miles driven in a year is:
     \[
     60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost based on the miles driven:**
   - John is charged $2 per mile.
   - Therefore, the cost for the miles driven in a year is:
     \[
     15000 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total bonus paid in a year:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the total bonus paid in a year is:
     \[
     150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total annual cost:**
   - The total annual cost is the sum of the cost for the miles driven and the total bonus paid.

"First, we need to determine the total amount of time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. According to the problem, on Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes and on Monday he exercised for 16 minutes. So, we add these two amounts together:

\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \]

Next, we need to find out how long Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday. The problem states that he wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. Therefore, we multiply the total time from Monday and Sunday by 2:

\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding and printing process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, can print four pages: the left back, the left front, the right front, and the right back.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the number of pages per piece of paper**: Each piece of paper, when folded, can print 4 pages.
2. **Calculate the number of pieces of paper needed**: Since the tabloid has 32 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper can print.
   \[
   \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece of paper}} = 8 \text{ pieces of paper}
   \]

Thus, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, we calculate how much Annika spent on food and snacks. She spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, which is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we account for the additional $10 she spent on rides. So, the total amount spent is:
\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money Annika has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she brought:
\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount of money Annika has left is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of books**: 250
2. **Books sold this year**: 45
3. **Books sold in the first year**: \(2 \times 45 = 90\)
4. **Books sold in the second year**: Let's denote this as \(x\)
5. **Books remaining unsold**: 50

First, we need to find out how many books have been sold in total so far. Since there are 50 unsold books, the number of books sold so far is:
\[250 - 50 = 200\]

Now, we know the number of books sold in the first and third years:
\[90 \text{ (first year)} + 45 \text{ (third year)} = 135\]

So, the number of books sold in the second year is:
\[200 - 135 = 65\]

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

Thus, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[
\boxed{1300}

"First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage. Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of:

\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ hours/week} \]

At a rate of $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

\[ 50 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of weeks in April. April typically has 4 weeks. Therefore, Watson's total earnings for April are:

\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$3200 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3200} \]"
"John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled a total of 20 people, the number of people he lost to is the total number of people minus the number of people he beat:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40
\]

Next, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales.

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning sales} = 60 - 40 = 20
\]

Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of the remaining 20 loaves.

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Therefore, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, which is the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks.

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, and Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds (the same as Joey in one week), we can calculate the total weeks Sandy needs to lose 8 pounds as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

So, it will take Sandy 8 weeks to lose 8 pounds. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream and the milk separately.

**Ice Cream:**
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings would be:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

**Milk:**
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5

If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total savings would be:
\[ 4 \times 0.5 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

**Total Savings:**
- Total savings from ice cream: $4
- Total savings from milk: $2
- Combined total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how many new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of extra arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every three days.
   - In fifteen days, the number of extra arms is given by:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Calculate the number of extra legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every five days.
   - In fifteen days, the number of extra legs is given by:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Calculate the total number of new limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 + 3 = 8
     \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow \(\boxed{8}\) new limbs."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Theo has left to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

1. **Calculate the cost of the business suits:**
   Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
   \[
   6 \times 100 = 600
   \]
   So, the total cost for the business suits is $600.

2. **Calculate the cost of the suitcases:**
   Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150
   \]
   So, the total cost for the suitcases is $150.

3. **Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:**
   The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of one business suit is $100.
   \[
   5 \times 100 = 500
   \]
   Adding $700 to this amount:
   \[
   500 + 700 = 1200
   \]
   So, the total cost for the flight ticket is $1200.

4. **Calculate the total amount spent so far:**
   Adding the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
   \[
   600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount Theo wants to save:**
   Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip.

6. **Calculate the total amount Theo has initially:**
   Theo has $6000 initially.

7. **Calculate the total amount Theo can spend on gifts:**
   Subtract the total amount spent so far and the amount he wants to save from the initial amount:
   \[
   6000 - 1950 - 2000 = 2050
   \]

So, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is \(\boxed{2050}\)."
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the daily egg consumption:**
   - Three people eat 3 eggs each per day.
     \[
     3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each per day.
     \[
     2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - Adding these together gives the total daily consumption:
     \[
     9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weekly egg consumption:**
   - Since they eat eggs every day, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week).
     \[
     13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week}
     \]

The family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"To determine Trent's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Therefore, we can calculate Trent's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Thus, Trent is \(\boxed{32}\) years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Cera's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - So, Noah's age six years ago was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old.
   - Therefore, Noah is currently \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20.
   - So, the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the number of players on each part of the team:
- Let \( D \) be the number of players on the defense.
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \) (twice as many as on the defense).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \) (half the number on the defense).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. According to the problem, this total is 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve this equation, first combine the terms on the left side. To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 1, 2, and 2 is 2. Rewrite the equation with a common denominator:
\[ \frac{2D}{2} + \frac{4D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ \frac{2D + 4D + D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

Next, eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 7:
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 8 people had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of marbles Solomon bought from Johanna:**
   Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.

2. **Calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him:**
   Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{40}{5} = 8
   \]
   Therefore, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles.

3. **Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has:**
   Solomon originally had 50 marbles in the store. He added the 20 marbles he bought from Johanna and the 8 marbles his father gave him. So, the total number of marbles is:
   \[

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of girls, nongendered children, and then sum these with the number of boys to find the total number of children in the classroom.

1. **Number of Boys:**
   The problem states that the classroom has 30 boys.

2. **Number of Girls:**
   The problem states that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys. Therefore, the number of girls is:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children:**
   The problem states that the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children:**
   To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Thus, the total number of children in the classroom is:
\[
\boxed{123}

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:
\[ P : W = 1 : 3 \]

This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. Therefore, we can express the number of electric wires in terms of the number of electric poles:
\[ W = 3P \]

We know that the number of electric wires \( W \) is 45. So, we substitute 45 for \( W \) in the equation:
\[ 45 = 3P \]

To find the number of electric poles \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people at the beginning of the party:
\[ 25 \text{ men} + 15 \text{ women} = 40 \text{ people} \]

Next, we calculate how many people left after an hour. Since \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total number of people left:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ people} \]

This means that 10 people left, so the number of people remaining at the party is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ people} \]

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's denote the number of women who stayed as \( w \). The total number of people who stayed is the sum of the men and women who stayed:
\[ 22 \text{ men} + w \text{ women} = 30 \text{ people} \]

Solving for \( w \):
\[ w = 30 - 22 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is:

"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of the magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The problem states that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine:

\[
\text{Cost of the pen} = 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Thus, the cost of the pen is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = 26 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of pencils in each box. Since there are three boxes, the number of pencils in the boxes is \( 3x \). Adding the 2 loose pencils, we get:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we know Jam has 3 boxes of 8 pencils each and 2 loose pencils, which totals 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together, we add Jam's pencils to Meg's pencils:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes are added to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total weakening of the coffee due to the ice cubes and the added cream.

1. **Determine the number of ice cubes needed:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
   \[
   \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Adding 15 milliliters of cream also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Calculate the total weakening:**
   The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
   \[
   60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of old records each person brings in.
- Since 5 people come in, the total number of old records brought in is \( 5x \).

According to the problem, for every 2 old records, a person gets 1 new record. Therefore, the number of new records each person gets is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

Since 5 people each get new records, the total number of new records they get is:
\[ 5 \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{5x}{2} \]

We know from the problem statement that the 5 people leave with 7 new records in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 7 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 5x = 14 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{14}{5} = 2.8 \]

Since \( x \) represents the number of old records each person brings in, and the total number of old records brought in by 5 people is \( 5x \), we calculate:
\[ 5x = 5 \times 2.8 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total number of old records the 5 people brought in is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the number of percentage points that need to be charged. The phone needs to go from 60% to 100%, which is a difference of:

\[ 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

Next, we know that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to find out how many minutes it will take to recharge 40 percentage points, we multiply the number of percentage points by the time it takes to recharge one percentage point:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take \(\boxed{2}\) hours to fully charge the cell phone."

"First, let's determine how many rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars off} \]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used the $4 off from their rewards. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon took:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars off} \]

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied to the $43 purchase:

\[ \text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the total discount from the $43 spent:

\[ \text{Amount paid} = 43 - 12 = 31 \]

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net income for Job A.

**Job A:**
- Annual salary: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net income for Job B.

**Job B:**
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining salary after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

"First, we need to find the total number of paintball guns that Nick, Richard, Jason (RJ), and DJ have combined. We do this by adding the number of guns each person has:

- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- Jason (RJ) has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Adding these together:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

Next, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the 4 people. To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

\[ 24 \div 4 = 6 \]

So, if they share the guns equally, each of them would have \(\boxed{6}\) guns."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we will calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Therefore, for 8 batches, the total sugar needed is:
  \[
  8 \times 30 = 240 \text{ ounces}
  \]

Next, we calculate the sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Therefore, for 1 batch, the total sugar needed is:
  \[
  1 \times 70 = 70 \text{ ounces}
  \]

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
\[
240 + 70 = 310 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the total amount of sugar Mason needs is:
\[
\boxed{310}

"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year when the stock price increases by 50%.

1. **Initial Value of Shares:**
   Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   \[
   \text{Initial Value} = 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Value After First Year:**
   The stock price increases by 50%.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 64 \times 0.50 = 32 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value After First Year} = 64 + 32 = 96 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Value After Second Year:**
   The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year.
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 96 \times 0.25 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value After Second Year} = 96 - 24 = 72 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is \(\boxed{72}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many hot dogs each person ate.

1. Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
2. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. Therefore, Thomas ate:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]
3. John ate half the amount Thomas ate. Therefore, John ate:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. Since John ate 3 hot dogs and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, the difference is:
\[
3 - 2 = 1
\]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Since the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the larger groups, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students in the class is 200, and the class is split into three groups. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the number of cows.
- \( H \) as the number of chickens.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + H = 60 \)
2. \( H = 2C \)

First, substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 2H + 4C \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 2 \times 40 + 4 \times 20 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is \(\boxed{160}\)."

   - After 1 week: \(3 + 1 = 4\) balls
   - After 2 weeks: \(4 + 1 = 5\) balls
   - After 3 weeks: \(5 + 1 = 6\) balls
   - After 4 weeks: \(6 + 1 = 7\) balls

3. **Balls dropped during the performance:**
   - Josh drops 3 balls during the performance.
   - 2 balls are caught by people in the crowd.
   - 1 ball is lost completely.

4. **Calculating the remaining balls:**
   - Josh starts with 7 balls.
   - He drops 3 balls: \(7 - 3 = 4\) balls.
   - 2 balls are caught: \(4 + 2 = 6\) balls.
   - 1 ball is lost: \(6 - 1 = 5\) balls.

So, the number of balls Josh has to juggle on stage is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad. Therefore, the blue beetle and the green toad each weigh 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. So, the yellow snake weighs:
   \[
   50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. So, the red bird weighs:
   \[
   50 - 20 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we need to find the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal. The weights of the animals are:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is:
\[

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.
2. At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits that her friend gave her. So, she received \(2 \times 24 = 48\) new baby outfits.
3. Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

Now, we need to find the total number of baby outfits Laurel has. We do this by adding the number of outfits from each source:

\[
24 \text{ (from her friend)} + 48 \text{ (from her baby shower)} + 15 \text{ (from her mom)}
\]

First, add the outfits from her friend and her baby shower:

\[
24 + 48 = 72

Next, add the outfits from her mom:

\[
72 + 15 = 87
\]

So, the total number of baby outfits Laurel has is \(\boxed{87}\)."
"First, let's determine how many meters Tyson will run each day if he follows his coach's advice. Tyson currently runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more meters. 

To find \( \frac{1}{5} \) of 5000 meters:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters}
\]

Adding this to his current daily distance:
\[
5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters}
\]

So, Tyson will run 6000 meters each day if he follows his coach's advice.

Next, we need to determine the total distance Tyson will cover in June. June has 30 days. Therefore, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days in June:
\[
6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters}

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny's son takes for his lunch:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Then, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we add the cookies taken by her son and her husband to find the total number of cookies used:
\[ 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies} \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of cookies used from the total number of cookies bought to find out how many cookies Jenny eats:

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the increase in daily revenue:

\[ \text{Increase in daily revenue} = \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in daily revenue}}{\text{Original daily revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"

"Let's denote the age of Carver's son as \( x \) years.

According to the problem, Carver just turned 45 years old, and this age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we need to solve this equation step by step.

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5 \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{50}{2} = \frac{2x}{2} \]
\[ 25 = x \]

So, the age of Carver's son is \( 25 \) years.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days the train goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily travel distance:

"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The problem states that a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

\[
3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing required:

\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:

\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time for each segment of the trip and then sum these times.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Distance: 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time: \(\frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time: \(\frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

Now, we add the times for both segments to find the total time of the trip:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time for the trip is \(\boxed{6}\) hours."
"To determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of fourth-grade boys:**
   - We know the total number of fourth-graders is 96.
   - Out of these, 43 are girls.
   - Therefore, the number of boys is:
     \[
     96 - 43 = 53
     \]

2. **Determine the number of boys absent on Friday:**
   - We are given that 4 fourth-grade boys were absent on Friday.

3. **Calculate the number of boys present on Friday:**
   - Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys:
     \[
     53 - 4 = 49
     \]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is \(\boxed{49}\)."
"To determine the total number of kids in the park, we start by identifying the number of girls and boys.

"Let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks. According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).
2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. So, the number of shoplifters is \( 4x - 5 \).
3. The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters. So, the number of people kicked out for physical violence is \( 3(4x - 5) \).
4. The total number of people kicked out is 50. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50
   \]
5. Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the equation:
   \[
   3 + (4 \cdot 3 - 5) + 3(4 \cdot 3 - 5) = 50
   \]
6. Simplify inside the parentheses:
   \[
   3 + (12 - 5) + 3(12 - 5) = 50
   \]
   \[
   3 + 7 + 3 \cdot 7 = 50
   \]
   \[
   3 + 7 + 21 = 50
   \]
   \[
   31 = 50
   \]
   This confirms that the values are consistent with the total of 50 people. Now, we need to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total number of people kicked out for the specific reasons (refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence) is:
   \[
   3 + (4 \cdot 3 - 5) + 3(4 \cdot 3 - 5) = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31
   \]
   Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
   \[
   50 - 31 = 19
   \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{19}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( E \) be the number of points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points. After scoring these 14 points, Erin's total points become \( E + 14 \).

According to the problem, after scoring these 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Sara scored 8 points, so three times Sara's points is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \).

This gives us the equation:
\[ E + 14 = 24 \]

To find \( E \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ E + 14 = 24 \]
Subtract 14 from both sides:
\[ E = 24 - 14 \]
\[ E = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - Additional cost for etching each frame is 20% of $20.
   - Etching cost per frame = \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Total cost per frame = \( 20 + 4 = 24 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for 44 seniors = \( 44 \times 24 = 1056 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - Total cost for pins = \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers = \( \frac{44}{4} = 11 \).
   - Each officer receives a cord that costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = \( 11 \times 12 = 132 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Sum of all the costs = cost of picture frames + cost of pins + cost of cords.
   - Total cost = \( 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1198 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1198}

"To determine the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the 20% discount and then subtract that from the original price.

1. Calculate 20% of $400:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{20}{100} \times 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80
   \]

2. Subtract the savings from the original price:
   \[
   400 - 80 = 320
   \]

Therefore, the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Friday Sales:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes on Friday.
   - Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the number of shoes sold on Friday is:
     \[
     14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ shoes}
     \]

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   - On Saturday, the store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   - Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Saturday is:
     \[
     14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs}
     \]
   - Converting pairs to shoes:
     \[
     28 \times 2 = 56 \text{ shoes}
     \]

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   - On Sunday, the store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Sunday is:
     \[
     \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs}
     \]
   - Converting pairs to shoes:
     \[
     14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ shoes}
     \]
   - However, six pairs were returned, so the actual number of shoes sold on Sunday is:
     \[
     28 - (6 \times 2) = 28 - 12 = 16 \text{ shoes}
     \]

4. **Total Sales:**
   - Adding up the shoes sold over the three days:
     \[
     28 \text{ (Friday)} + 56 \text{ (Saturday)} + 16 \text{ (Sunday)} = 100 \text{ shoes}
     \]

Thus, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:
\[
\boxed{100}

2. **Thursday's practice:**
   Hallie practiced for 2 hours on Thursday.

3. **Saturday's practice:**
   Hallie's Saturday practice lasted twice as long as her Tuesday practice. Since she practiced for 1 hour on Tuesday, her Saturday practice was:
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we sum the hours from each day:
\[
1 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 2 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Saturday)} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice each week is:

"First, we need to determine the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. Since the faulty pieces are worth 40% of the total $400,000, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

This means the value of the functioning pieces of equipment is the total amount minus the value of the faulty pieces:

\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

\[ \boxed{240000} \]"
"To determine how much milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Identify the number of sheep that produce 1 kg of milk and the number that produce 2 kg of milk.
   - Mary has 30 sheep in total.
   - Half of the sheep produce 1 kg of milk, so \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep produce 1 kg of milk each day.
   - The other half of the sheep produce 2 kg of milk, so \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep produce 2 kg of milk each day.

2. Calculate the total milk produced by the sheep that produce 1 kg of milk.
   - Since 15 sheep produce 1 kg of milk each, the total milk from these sheep is \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg.

3. Calculate the total milk produced by the sheep that produce 2 kg of milk.
   - Since 15 sheep produce 2 kg of milk each, the total milk from these sheep is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg.

4. Add the two amounts together to find the total milk collected every day.
   - The total milk collected every day is \( 15 + 30 = 45 \) kg.

Therefore, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is \(\boxed{45}\) kg."

"First, let's determine how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

So, 20 pupils like blue. This leaves:

\[
40 - 20 = 20
\]

pupils who do not like blue. Out of these remaining 20 pupils, one-fourth likes green. Therefore, the number of pupils who like green is:

\[
\frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:

\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

So, the number of pupils who like yellow is:

\[
\boxed{15}

1. **Determine the number of apples sold on Monday:**
   - Lucy sold the apples at $4 per piece and made $56.
   - The number of apples sold on Monday is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
     \]

2. **Determine the number of apples picked on Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

3. **Determine the number of apples picked on Wednesday:**
   - Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   - The number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest for five months. The formula for simple interest is:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the annual interest rate (R) is 10%, and the time (T) is 5 months. Since the interest rate is given annually, we need to convert the time into years. There are 12 months in a year, so 5 months is \(\frac{5}{12}\) years.

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 152.0835 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.0835 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.0835 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.0835}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.4167 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay \(\boxed{760.42}\) per month."
"First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked. Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. The distance can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Cho:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked. Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. Using the same formula:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has:
- 50 silver pesos
- 80 gold pesos

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

Total silver pesos:
\[ 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Total gold pesos:
\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \]

So, the total number of pesos they have together is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she has 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the supplies, which is $18. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells all the lemonade, we need to find out how much profit she makes per hour. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:
\[ \text{Total cups} = 36 \]
\[ \text{Cups per hour} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Hours to sell all lemonade} = \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the profit per hour is:
\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how much land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.
2. According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.
3. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
   \]
5. Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
   \]

So, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially is \(\boxed{32}\) hectares."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26
\]

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform.

On the day of the performance, half of the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13
\]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

Adding these together step-by-step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400.

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"

"First, we need to determine how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. According to the problem, he delivers \( \frac{1}{3} \) as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. Since he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson, the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find the total number of messages delivered by adding the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

Thus, the total number of messages James delivers is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:

- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride:

- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36\).

Now, let's compare the total costs:

- David's total cost with the bracelet: $30.
- Dasha's total cost with tickets: $36.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:

\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

So, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the total number of gifts Monica is wrapping. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. Adding these together gives:

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

So, Monica is wrapping a total of 12 gifts. She has 144 inches of ribbon to use for the bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

Therefore, Monica can use \(\boxed{12}\) inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, and together they have 165 popsicles.

First, let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles can be expressed as:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Therefore, Sam has \(\boxed{15}\) more popsicles than Betty."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling these services. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original cost. So, the cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.80 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable subscription, which is $60 per month. The amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription and getting the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's break down the time Carol spends on each task:

1. **Writing a song**: 4 hours
2. **Recording**: Half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. **Editing**: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

Next, we calculate the total work time:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of the total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total work time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"To determine how many books Wendy needs to carry, we first need to calculate the total number of books that can fit in the shelving system. The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books that can fit is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Next, we need to find out how many books Wendy wants to place. According to the problem, she wants to place 20 more than double the number of books that can fit in the system. So, we first calculate double the number of books that can fit:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]

Then, we add 20 to this number to find out how many books Wendy wants to place:

\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, the number of books Wendy will need to carry is:

\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

1. Erica made 20 cards.
2. Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

Adding these together, Erica initially had:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

The total number of cards she passed out is:
\[ 24 + 5 = 29 \text{ cards} \]

Now, we calculate the net change in the number of cards Erica has:
\[ 50 - 29 + 17 \]

First, subtract the cards passed out:
\[ 50 - 29 = 21 \]

Then, add the cards received:
\[ 21 + 17 = 38 \]

So, the final number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"First, let's determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices}
\]

Next, Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. Again, since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices}
\]

Now, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices}
\]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, we subtract the slices Jenny eats from the total number of slices:
\[
12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices}
\]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine how many days Mark needs to save enough money to buy a bike that costs $300, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Mark needs to save:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of the bike} = \$300
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money already in the account} = \$50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional money needed} = \$300 - \$50 = \$250
   \]

2. Determine how much money Mark earns per day:
   \[
   \text{Daily earnings} = \$10
   \]

3. Calculate the number of days required to save the additional $250:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Additional money needed}}{\text{Daily earnings}} = \frac{250}{10} = 25
   \]

Therefore, Mark needs to save for \(\boxed{25}\) days."
"To determine the total number of bugs Nancy saw, we need to calculate the number of each type of bug and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders:**
   Nancy saw 90 spiders.

2. **Millipedes:**
   The number of millipedes is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the number of spiders.
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]

3. **Stink Bugs:**
   The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

4. **Total Number of Bugs:**
   Now, we sum the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs.
   \[
   \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168
   \]

Thus, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is \(\boxed{168}\)."
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify Erica's age.
2. Use the information given to find Beth's age.

"To determine how much the builder earns in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days the builder works in one month.
2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the year.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days the builder works in one month.**

The builder works 6 days every week and there are 4 weeks in a month.
\[ \text{Days worked per month} = 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.**

There are 12 months in a year.
\[ \text{Days worked per year} = 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for the year.**

The builder earns $50 per day.
\[ \text{Total earnings per year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \times 50 \text{ dollars/day} = 14400 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the quantities required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

1. **Calculate the amount of flour needed:**
   - Normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour.
   - For a quadruple batch, Mark needs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cups of flour.
   - Flour is sold in 2-cup bags.
   - Therefore, Mark needs \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) bags of flour.

2. **Calculate the amount of milk needed:**
   - Normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk.
   - For a quadruple batch, Mark needs \(1 \times 4 = 4\) cups of milk.
   - Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.
   - Therefore, Mark needs \(\frac{4}{2} = 2\) bottles of milk.

3. **Determine the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:**
   - Mark needs 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk.
   - The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\).

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The power consumption of the air conditioner is 900 watts. Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, the power consumption in kilowatts is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts} = 0.9 \text{ kW} \]

When the air conditioner is used for 8 hours a day, the daily energy consumption is:
\[ 0.9 \text{ kW} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7.2 \text{ kWh} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The daily energy consumption when the air conditioner is used for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 0.9 \text{ kW} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2.7 \text{ kWh} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \text{ kWh} - 2.7 \text{ kWh} = 4.5 \text{ kWh} \]

To find out how much energy is saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kWh} \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy saved in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of stripes on each zebra:

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each. So, the total number of stripes for these two zebras is:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34
   \]

2. The next zebra has 36 stripes.

3. The last zebra has half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes. So, the number of stripes on this zebra is:
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18
   \]

Next, we sum the total number of stripes on all the zebras:
\[
34 + 36 + 18 = 88
\]

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[
\frac{88}{4} = 22
\]

Thus, the average number of stripes per zebra is:
\[
\boxed{22}
\]"
"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - There are 20 people in total.

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat needed = \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of cheese needed = \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of meat = \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   - The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of cheese = \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \).

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = \( 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to finish reading the book 10 minutes before his departure time:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, we can find out how many minutes early he will be:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment per employee in May: \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars
   - Total payment for all employees in May: \( 600 \times 40 = 24000 \) dollars

2. **Calculate the number of employees in June:**
   - Number of employees who left in June: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means the second pound of taffy is half the price of the first pound, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, so 4 magnets cost:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

"First, let's determine the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it is worth twice the amount of the first pack, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we find the total cost of the two packs of fireworks before the discount:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks to find the discounted price:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted price of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we can follow these steps:

   Shannon eats 2 cookies each night. Over 30 days, the total number of cookies she eats is:
   \[
   2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Determine how many dozens of cookies this is:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we convert the total number of cookies into dozens:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of madeleine cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a candle will both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide the probability that a candle will explode. We can only work with the given information about the candles that have a defect of smelling like wet dog.

Given:
- 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
- 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles are expected to explode.

Since the problem does not specify the relationship between the defect of smelling like wet dog and the probability of exploding, we can assume that these events are independent. This means the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and exploding is the product of the individual probabilities of each event.

Let's denote:
- \( P(\text{Smell like wet dog}) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(\text{Explode}) = 0.01 \)

The probability that a candle both smells like wet dog and explodes is:
\[ P(\text{Smell like wet dog and Explode}) = P(\text{Smell like wet dog}) \times P(\text{Explode}) = 0.05 \times 0.01 = 0.0005 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of the 50,000 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles} = 50000 \times 0.0005 = 25 \]

So, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, calculate the discount amount for each blouse. Since the blouses are on a 30% off rack, the discount per blouse is:

\[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the price of each blouse after the discount is:

\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the 4 blouses is:

\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister from each type of tree.

- Let \( J_t \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees.
- Let \( J_s \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees.
- Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
- Let \( S_t \) be the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the tallest trees.
- Let \( S_s \) be the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the shortest trees.
- Let \( S_a \) be the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the average trees.

From the problem, we know:
1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( J_t = 30 \).
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, so \( J_s = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
3. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so \( S_t = 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
4. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so \( S_s = 3 \times 15 = 45 \).
5. Joanne's sister gathers no apples from the average trees, so \( S_a = 0 \).

The total number of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J_t + J_s + J_a + S_t + S_s + S_a = 500 \]

Substituting the known values into the equation:
\[ 30 + 15 + J_a + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + J_a = 500 \]

Solving for \( J_a \):
\[ J_a = 500 - 150 = 350 \]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of camels.
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, this gives us the equation:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

Now we have the following system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
c + d = 180 \\
2c + d = 304
\end{cases}
\]

To solve this system, we can use the method of elimination. First, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
\[
2c + d - c - d = 124
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
\[
d = 180 - 124
\]
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first four days:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the following day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Peter's Locker Size:**
   Peter's locker is given as 5 cubic inches.

2. **Zack's Locker Size:**
   Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, we can express Zack's locker size in terms of Peter's locker size:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times \text{Peter's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Timothy's Locker Size:**
   Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can express Timothy's locker size in terms of Zack's locker size:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times \text{Zack's locker} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"First, we determine the elevation of Stanley's comb after it fell from his position. Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb's elevation is:

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of the comb. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find the difference in elevation between Oliver and the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:

\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

First, we know the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cats**: There were 50 cats on the rock.

2. **Cats carried away by boats**: Four boats each carried away 5 cats.
   \[
   4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cats}
   \]
   So, the number of cats left after the boats carried some away is:
   \[
   50 - 20 = 30 \text{ cats}
   \]

3. **Cats that ran after a mouse**: 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats}
   \]
   So, the number of cats left on the rock is:
   \[
   30 - 18 = 12 \text{ cats}
   \]

The final number of cats left on the rock is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Now, we add up all these costs:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256
\]

The total cost for 2 years of the service is \(\$256\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that Cole saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars from the jogger jeans} \]
and
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars from the tattered jeans} \]

Now, let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, so \( T = 28 \). The original price of the jogger jeans is $6 more than the sale price, so \( J = 22 + 6 = 28 \).

However, the problem asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the original price of the jogger jeans is $28 and the original price of the tattered jeans is also $28, the difference is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees

3. **Minivans:**
   - Number of minivans: 10
   - Capacity per minivan: 15 employees
   - Total capacity for minivans: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) employees

Next, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:

\[
240 \text{ (buses)} + 180 \text{ (minibusses)} + 150 \text{ (minivans)} = 570 \text{ employees}
\]

Thus, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is \(\boxed{570}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of bird feeders Lillian has. She builds 3 and buys 3, so the total number of bird feeders is:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out how many birds each type of feeder attracts. The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. Therefore, the feeders Lillian made attract:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ birds each} \]

Since Lillian has 3 feeders she made and 3 store-bought feeders, we can calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder. The total number of birds attracted by the feeders she made is:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:
\[ 90 + 60 = 150 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which costs $4.

The additional cost for the soup due to the 25% increase is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, the cost of the soup is:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the cake, which is half the price of the bagel:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleksandra needed to pay for the dinner is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his cards, so he sells \(\frac{2}{3}\) of his cards. The money he gets from selling these cards is \(\frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5\).

According to the problem, the money he gets from selling the cards is $50, which is the cost of the ticket to the amusement park. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = 50
\]

First, simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = \frac{2}{3}x \times \frac{3}{2} = x
\]

So the equation simplifies to:

\[
x = 50
\]

Thus, Kenny started with \(\boxed{50}\) cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of guests who would have two hotdogs:**
   - The caterer prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.

2. **Calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared for these 18 guests:**
   - Each of these 18 guests would have 2 hotdogs.
   - So, \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs are prepared for these 18 guests.

3. **Determine the number of hotdogs left for the remaining guests:**
   - The total number of guests who showed up is 40.
   - Out of these, 18 guests already have their hotdogs.
   - Therefore, \( 40 - 18 = 22 \) guests are left.

4. **Calculate the total number of hotdogs needed for the remaining 22 guests to have a second hotdog:**
   - Each of these 22 guests wants a second hotdog.
   - So, \( 22 \times 2 = 44 \) hotdogs are needed for these 22 guests.

5. **Determine the number of hotdogs available:**
   - The caterer prepared 36 hotdogs for the first 18 guests.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs available is 36.

6. **Calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog:**
   - The 22 guests need 44 hotdogs, but only 36 hotdogs are available.
   - Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( 22 - \frac{36}{2} = 22 - 18 = 4 \).

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. According to the problem, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Adding 4 more letters to this half:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

So, her sister's name has 7 letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final amount for Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"

- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- Money saved: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
\]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
\]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline each container holds in gallons. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons to pints. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. Therefore, we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money George had left after his purchase. Since he spent 1% of his money, he had 99% of his money left. George spent $5, so 99% of his money is the amount he had left. Let's denote the total amount of money George had initially as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99x = x - 5 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 0.01x = 5 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{5}{0.01} = 500 \]
So, George initially had $500.

Next, we need to determine how much money George spent on the chips and candy bars. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, so the cost of the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]
Let \( y \) be the number of candy bars he bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the cost of the candy bars is:
\[ 0.75y \text{ dollars} \]
The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the chips and the candy bars, which is $5:
\[ 1.20 + 0.75y = 5 \]
Solving for \( y \):
\[ 0.75y = 5 - 1.20 \]
\[ 0.75y = 3.80 \]
\[ y = \frac{3.80}{0.75} = \frac{380}{75} = \frac{76}{15} \approx 5.0667 \]
Since \( y \) must be a whole number, and the only feasible whole number close to 5.0667 is 5, we check:
\[ 0.75 \times 5 = 3.75 \]
\[ 1.20 + 3.75 = 4.95 \]
This is very close to $5, and considering the context of the problem, it is reasonable to conclude that George bought 5 candy bars.

Thus, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray originally had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Next, we need to divide these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we perform the division:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of Ray's friends received \(\boxed{5}\) lollipops."
"Rory's cake initially weighs 20 ounces. She cuts it into 8 pieces, and both Rory and her mom each take one piece. This means 2 pieces are taken, and since the cake was evenly divided, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

Since 2 pieces are eaten, the total weight of the pieces eaten is:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the cake is:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, we need to find the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris bought together. Sitti bought 34 oranges and Juris bought 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will share these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:

\[ 56 \div 8 = 7 \]

So, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Bernadette should leave earlier than Wayne to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before him.

First, let's establish the time it takes for each of them to reach the theater:
- Wayne's travel time to the theater is given as 4 minutes.
- Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time, which is \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.

Next, we need to account for the 5-minute difference in their arrival times:
- Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

Since Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes and Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes, we need to find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave to account for the 5-minute difference in their arrival times.

The total time difference between their travel times is:
\[ 16 \text{ minutes} - 4 \text{ minutes} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

To ensure Bernadette arrives 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than the 12-minute difference in travel times. Therefore, Bernadette should leave:
\[ 12 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 7 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Bernadette should leave 7 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

**Final Answer:**
Bernadette should leave 7 minutes earlier than Wayne."
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width by rearranging the formula:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:

- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:

- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has compared to Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking Process**:
   - Marcus spends 3 hours baking.
   - Every hour the oven is on, the temperature rises by 5 degrees.
   - Therefore, in 3 hours, the temperature will rise by \(3 \times 5 = 15\) degrees.
   - The new temperature after baking is \(40 + 15 = 55\) degrees.

3. **Cooling Process**:
   - Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes.
   - The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - In 30 minutes, the temperature will drop by \(30 / 10 \times 2 = 3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run.

James's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

Therefore, the time it took James to do the run is:

"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can calculate the length of Movie C as follows:

\[ \text{Length of Movie C} = 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, we can find the length of Movie B by adding 5 minutes to the length of Movie C:

\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, we can find the length of Movie A by dividing the length of Movie B by 4:

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the length of Movie A is:

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the time in hours is \( \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \) hours.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles}

"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog can be made with 50 eggs, given that each glass requires 5 eggs. We do this by dividing the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:
\[
\frac{50}{5} = 10
\]
So, Rozanne can make 10 glasses of eggnog. Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the number of trays she can put out is:
\[
\frac{10}{5} = 2
\]
Therefore, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"First, let's calculate Joey's total points after his turn in Scrabble. Joey initially has 214 points and scores an additional 26 points.

\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

Next, let's calculate Marcy's total points after her turn. Marcy initially has 225 points and scores an additional 10 points.

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's points to determine by how many points Joey is winning.

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points. 

Final answer: Joey is winning by 5 points."
"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per sneaker:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of sneakers}} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from the flash sale:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} \times \text{Price per sneaker at flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} = \text{Total number of sneakers} - \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} = 48 - 17 = 31
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} \times \text{Price per sneaker to department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from flash sale} + \text{Revenue from department store} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 576 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate the profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}
   \]

The salesman's profit is \(\boxed{539}\) dollars."

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

First, we calculate the total cost if you buy the super ticket:
- The super ticket costs $20.
- With the super ticket, you get one popcorn and a soda for an additional $1.
- The cost of the soda is $3.
- Therefore, the total cost with the super ticket is \( 20 + 1 = 21 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost if you buy a regular movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda:
- The regular movie ticket costs $12.
- The soda costs $3.
- The popcorn costs \( P \).
- Therefore, the total cost without the super ticket is \( 12 + 3 + P = 15 + P \) dollars.

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means the cost of the regular ticket and popcorn and soda is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket:
\[ 15 + P = 21 - 2 \]
\[ 15 + P = 19 \]
\[ P = 19 - 15 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"First, we need to determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. This is calculated by multiplying the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
\]

Calculating each term separately:

\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]
\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]

Adding these together:

\[
10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

Therefore, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then use the formula for average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, calculate the distance traveled at each speed:
- For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours:
  \[ \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

- For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
  \[ \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, calculate the total time taken:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, calculate the average speed:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

The car's average speed during the trip is \(50\) mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she will have:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of her 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can break the problem down into smaller steps.

First, calculate the number of apples each person eats in 30 days:
- Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats \(4 \times 30 = 120\) apples.
- Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats \(4 \times 30 = 120\) apples.

Next, add the number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:
- The total number of apples eaten by both in 30 days is \(120 + 120 = 240\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of potting soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil are required. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know there are 15 red cards, and the number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.

To find 60% of 15:
\[ 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of green cards is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow cards. The problem states that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards. Therefore, we add the number of red cards and green cards:
\[ 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we sum up all the cards:
\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 39 \text{ (yellow)} = 78 \]

So, the total number of cards is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.
2. After about twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies. These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there, so the total number of fairies became \( 50 + 25 = 75 \).
3. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of puppies.
2. Calculate the total number of puppies that have spots.
3. Determine the percentage of puppies that have spots.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of puppies.**

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of puppies that have spots.**

Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

**Step 3: Determine the percentage of puppies that have spots.**

The percentage of puppies that have spots is calculated by dividing the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies, and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Calculate the total weight of the sugar cubes:**
   \[
   2 \text{ boxes} \times 1 \text{ pound/box} = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the carrots:**
   \[
   4 \text{ bags} \times 12 \text{ pounds/bag} = 48 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the hay:**
   \[

   \[
   2 \text{ pounds} + 48 \text{ pounds} + 3150 \text{ pounds} + 1300 \text{ pounds} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
   \]

6. **Determine the number of trips needed:**
   The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip would still require a full trip to transport the remaining feed).
   \[
   \frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{2250 \text{ pounds/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
   \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings from recycling cans and bottles, and then multiply that by four.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings from recycling aluminum cans:
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from cans are \(3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week}\).

Next, let's calculate the weekly earnings from recycling plastic bottles:
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from bottles are \(5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week}\).

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings from both cans and bottles:
- Her total weekly earnings are \(6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week}\).

Finally, let's calculate her total earnings for a four-week month:

"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. **Starting Position:** Finley started in 1st place.
2. **First Change:** She fell back 5 spots.
   - \(1 - 5 = -4\)
   - Since positions are typically counted from 1, a negative position means she is 4 places behind the starting position, which would be 5th place (since 1st - 4 = 5th).

3. **Second Change:** She moved ahead 2 spots.
   - \(5 + 2 = 7\)
   - So, she is now in 7th place.

4. **Third Change:** She fell behind 3 spots.
   - \(7 - 3 = 4\)
   - So, she is now in 4th place.

5. **Fourth Change:** She jumped ahead 1 spot.

"To determine how many shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to follow the changes in the number of shoes step by step.

1. **Initial number of shoes:**
   Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Shoes added on Monday:**
   He gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he gets:
   \[
   5 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes per pair} = 10 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Adding these to his initial count:
   \[
   200 + 10 = 210 \text{ shoes}
   \]

3. **Shoes added on Wednesday:**
   He gains 15 pairs of shoes on Wednesday. Each pair consists of 2 shoes, so he gets:

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed by the equation:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate the term involving \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"First, let's convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

Each remora is \(6 \, \text{inches} \div 12 = 0.5 \, \text{feet}\).

Benny has 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[2 \times 0.5 \, \text{feet} = 1 \, \text{foot}\]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find what percentage the combined length of the remoras is of the shark's body length, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
\]

Here, the ""Part"" is the combined length of the remoras (1 foot), and the ""Whole"" is the shark's body length (10 feet). So,

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
\]

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the following equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]
\[
x = 80
\]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is \(\boxed{80}\)."

"To determine how many books each of Sarah's children received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Sarah bought.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of children.

First, we find out how many books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we divide $300 by $15:

\[
\frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

So, Sarah bought 20 books. Next, we need to divide these 20 books equally among her 4 children:

\[
\frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Therefore, each child received \(\boxed{5}\) books."
"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (the number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (the number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (the number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and then add the number of tour guides.

First, we calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups.
- Each group has 200 employees.

\[
3 \text{ groups} \times 200 \text{ employees/group} = 600 \text{ employees}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group has 7 tour guides.
- There are 3 groups.

\[
3 \text{ groups} \times 7 \text{ tour guides/group} = 21 \text{ tour guides}
\]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:

\[
600 \text{ employees} + 21 \text{ tour guides} = 621 \text{ people}
\]

Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is:

\[
\boxed{621}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel stay. The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day.

The increase in price is:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the new price per day is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. The cost of each plane ticket is $5000, and since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"

- Three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, which is \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) tubes of yellow paint.

Now, we add the number of blue and yellow paint tubes that Jasper has:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (yellow)} = 11 \text{ tubes of paint} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we start by determining the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, and the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

First, we calculate the weight of the 2010 penny:
\[
\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = \frac{3 \times 48}{4} = \frac{144}{4} = 36 \text{ grains}
\]

Next, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny to find the combined weight:
\[
\text{Combined weight} = 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grains}
\]

Thus, the combined weight of the two pennies is:
\[
\boxed{84}
\]"
"To determine how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first need to calculate the total amount they have already earned.

Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91. Adding these amounts together gives:
\[ 83 + 91 = 174 \]

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they have already earned from their goal:
\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

Therefore, they need to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs Gabriel's player can hold compared to Luri's. Since each player can hold up to 100 songs, we calculate the remaining capacity for each:

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player compared to Gabriel. We subtract the number of songs Luri can still add from the number of songs Gabriel can still add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. According to the bet, he gives up $10 for each orange he eats. Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To determine the cost of Jillian's handbag, we start by identifying the given information and setting up the equation based on that information.

1. Jillian's shoes cost $80.
2. The handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes.

Let's denote the cost of the handbag as \( H \) and the cost of the shoes as \( S \). According to the problem, \( S = 80 \).

The relationship between the handbag and the shoes can be expressed as:
\[ H = 3S - 20 \]

Substituting the value of \( S \) into the equation:
\[ H = 3 \times 80 - 20 \]

Now, perform the multiplication and subtraction:
\[ H = 240 - 20 \]
\[ H = 220 \]

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is \(\boxed{220}\)."
"First, calculate the total miles James runs in a week:

\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, since James runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day.
   \[
   5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   There are four horses, each consuming 10 pounds of oats per day.
   \[
   10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   The horses consume 40 pounds of oats per day, and we need to find out how much they will consume over five days.
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find out how many bags are needed for 200 pounds, we divide the total pounds by the pounds per bag.
   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}
   \]

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs \(\boxed{4}\) bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we need to determine how many of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's 27 puppies are Pomeranians, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of girl Pomeranians Jana has is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we first need to sum the highest temperatures of each country and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48 degrees Fahrenheit
- Northlandia: 21 degrees Fahrenheit
- Midlandia: -3 degrees Fahrenheit

First, we sum these temperatures:
\[
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -30
\]

Next, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
\[
\frac{-30}{3} = -10
\]

Therefore, the average highest temperature of these three countries is \(-10\) degrees Fahrenheit."
"First, we need to determine how much more money the child needs to save to buy the toy car. The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. So, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the toy car:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

The child needs to save an additional $8. If he saves $2 each day, we need to find out how many days it will take him to save $8. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \]

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money. 

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"

According to the problem, in four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).

In four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \). We can set up the following equation based on the information given:

\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \( A \):

\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

So, Angela is currently \(\boxed{38}\) years old."
"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the cost for both the morning and afternoon rides and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning each day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives 14 mornings in total.

\[
\text{Total cost for morning rides} = 14 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ dollars/day} = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon each day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives 14 afternoons in total.

\[
\text{Total cost for afternoon rides} = 14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ dollars/day} = 28 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( x \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the number of guests, \( x \), for which the total costs are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

\[
200 + 5x = 25x
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides to isolate the variable terms on one side:

\[
200 = 25x - 5x
\]

2. Simplify the right-hand side:

\[
200 = 20x
\]

3. Divide both sides by 20 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{200}{20} = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the number of insects each person found:
- Let \( L \) be the number of insects Lily found.
- Let \( D \) be the number of insects David found.
- Let \( B \) be the number of insects Bodhi found.

We are given the following information:
1. Together, they collected 43 insects: \( L + D + B = 43 \).
2. Lily found 7 more than David: \( L = D + 7 \).
3. David found half of what Bodhi found: \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) or equivalently \( B = 2D \).

We can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation. From the second equation, we have \( L = D + 7 \). From the third equation, we have \( B = 2D \). Substituting these into the first equation gives:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43. \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43. \]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36. \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9. \]
Now that we know \( D = 9 \), we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16, \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18. \]
So, Lily found \( 16 \) insects. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used.
2. Calculate the amount of yarn her grandma used.
3. Add the two amounts together to find the total amount of yarn used.

First, let's find out how much yarn Mariah used. Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, let's find out how much yarn her grandma used. Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. So we calculate:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

Therefore, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is \(\boxed{273}\)."

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Using the width of the rug we just calculated:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the problem:
- Let \( S \) be the cost of one pack of strawberry gum.
- Let \( G \) be the cost of one pack of grape gum.
- Let \( A \) be the cost of one pack of green apple gum.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. She bought two packs of strawberry gum.
3. She bought one pack of grape gum.
4. She bought one small pack of green apple gum, which cost half as much as the grape gum.
5. The total cost of the gum is $7.

We can write the following equations based on the information given:
1. \( 2S + G + A = 7 \)
2. \( A = \frac{1}{2}G \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \( A \):
\[ 2S + G + \frac{1}{2}G = 7 \]
\[ 2S + \frac{3}{2}G = 7 \]

To clear the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 2:
\[ 4S + 3G = 14 \]

We also know from the problem that the cost of one pack of grape gum is $2:
\[ G = 2 \]

Now substitute \( G = 2 \) back into the equation \( 4S + 3G = 14 \):
\[ 4S + 3(2) = 14 \]
\[ 4S + 6 = 14 \]
\[ 4S = 8 \]
\[ S = 2 \]

So, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood. The 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks, while the 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks. Frederick has $24 to spend.

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces he can buy with $24:
\[
\text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
\]
If he buys 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood, he will get:
\[
6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy with $24:
\[
\text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{24}{6} = 4
\]
If he buys 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he will get:
\[
4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Comparing the two options, buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood gives him more sticks (1600 sticks) than buying 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood (1200 sticks).

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:
\[
\boxed{1600}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of legs among Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$4.40 \text{ per day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$4.40 \text{ per day} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Next, we compare this cost to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20.00. The savings from buying the weekly bus pass is:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to find out how many cows the zoo has. According to the information, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheep the farm has. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the total number of animals on the farm is:
\[ 30 + 10 = 40 \]

The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so the total number of animals in the zoo is:
\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Adding the total number of animals from both the farm and the zoo, we get:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by analyzing the information given:

- Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
- Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

First, let's find out how many onions Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equation for the onions:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} \times 4 = 12 \]
Solving for the number of onions Sophia bought:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Next, let's find out how many potatoes Sophia bought. Similarly, since Rose bought 4 times the number of potatoes that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equation for the potatoes:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} \times 4 = 4 \]
Solving for the number of potatoes Sophia bought:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Now, we add the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought to find the total:
\[ \text{Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought} = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Thus, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. Since it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calorie deficit required is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days available:**
   Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July (up to July 19th): 19 days
   Adding these together:
   \[
   31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal. 

**Final Answer:**
553 calories per day."

"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes.

\[ \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 500 \times \frac{20}{100} = 500 \times 0.20 = 100 \]

So, after buying clothes, Julie has:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 400 \times \frac{25}{100} = 400 \times 0.25 = 100 \]

So, after buying CDs, Julie has:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is:

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( L \) be the cost of the lot.
- Let \( H \) be the cost of the house.

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( H + L = 120,000 \)
2. \( H = 3L \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house using the second equation:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is \(\boxed{90000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so the total number of canvas bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for 8 packs is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 canvas bags for $8, so the total revenue is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes in a fight.
2. Multiply the total number of minutes by the number of punches Joe throws per minute.

First, we know that a fight consists of 5 rounds, and each round lasts 3 minutes. Therefore, the total number of minutes in the fight is:
\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Joe throws 25 punches per minute. So, the total number of punches Joe throws in 15 minutes is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes} \times 25 \text{ punches/minute} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

Thus, the total number of punches Joe threw is:
\[
\boxed{375}

"To determine how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Suzanne made 36 cookies.
   \[
   \text{Cookies made by Suzanne} = 36
   \]

2. Next, we are told that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. So, we calculate the number of cookies Josh made:
   \[
   \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
   \]

3. Finally, we are told that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. This means Kelsie made twice the number of cookies that Josh made:
   \[
   \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

So, the number of cookies Kelsie made is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has:
- Four $10 bills, which amount to \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Six $20 bills, which amount to \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars}\]

Next, Ali gives half of his total money to his sister. Therefore, the amount given to his sister is:
\[\frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars}\]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars}\]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars}\]

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars}\]

So, the final amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:
\[\boxed{32}\]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we need to calculate double the time Rob takes and then add 40 minutes to it.

Double the time Rob takes is:

\[ 2 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 40 minutes to this gives:

\[ 240 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 280 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Royce takes:

\[ \boxed{280} \text{ minutes} \]"

   Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's rate:**
   Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony. Therefore, Bobby's rate is:
   \[
   6 - 1 = 5 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]

3. **Kathy's rate:**
   Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby. Therefore, Kathy's rate is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]

4. **Ricky's rate:**
   Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy. Therefore, Ricky's rate is:

   - There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - There are 7 days in a week, so her weekly consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

3. **Current Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her weekly cost is:
     \[
     84 \text{ kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$126/\text{week}
     \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's new weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

4. **New Daily Consumption:**
   - The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so her new daily consumption is:
     \[

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 10 days is double the time to paint half a house).

Next, we need to find out the rate at which 5 people can paint a house. Since the work rate is additive, 5 people can paint a house 5 times as fast as one person. Therefore, 5 people can paint a whole house in \(\frac{10}{5} = 2\) days.

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( O_s \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has.
- Let \( O_c \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has.
- Let \( J_s \) be the number of sofas Jenna has.
- Let \( J_c \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( O_s = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( O_s = O_c - 2 \). Substituting \( O_s = 20 \) into this equation, we get \( 20 = O_c - 2 \). Solving for \( O_c \), we get \( O_c = 22 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( J_c = 3 \times O_c = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( J_s = J_c - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we need to find the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have. The total number of sofas is \( O_s + J_s = 20 + 64 = 84 \). The total number of chairs is \( O_c + J_c = 22 + 66 = 88 \). Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is \( 84 + 88 = 172 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. Since Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, we can calculate his current age as follows:
\[ \text{Jame's current age} = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, let's denote Jame's cousin's current age as \( C \). In 8 years, Jame's age will be:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin's age will be:
\[ C + 8 \]
And twice Jame's age in 8 years is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]
So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ C + 8 = 60 - 5 \]
\[ C + 8 = 55 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 55 - 8 \]
\[ C = 47 \]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin:
\[ \text{Age difference} = 47 - 22 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the costs of the items:
- Let \( C \) be the cost of the computer.
- Let \( M \) be the cost of one monitor.
- Let \( P \) be the cost of the printer.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. The cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer.
3. The cost of the computer is $1,100.

First, we can express the cost of the printer in terms of the cost of the computer:
\[ P = C - 400 \]
Since \( C = 1100 \), we substitute this value into the equation for \( P \):
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, we can write the equation for the total cost:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]
Substituting the known values of \( C \) and \( P \) into this equation, we get:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
Simplifying the left side, we have:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
To find \( 2M \), we subtract 1800 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2M = 600 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ M = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"To determine how many seashells each girl brought, we start by identifying the number of seashells each boy brought, which is given as 60 seashells.

Next, we need to calculate the number of seashells each girl brought. According to the problem, each girl brought an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Therefore, we can express the number of seashells each girl brought as:
\[ 60 + 4 \times 60 \]

First, we calculate \(4 \times 60\):
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \]

Then, we add this result to 60:
\[ 60 + 240 = 300 \]

Thus, each girl brought 300 seashells. The final answer is:

"First, let's determine how many candies George originally had. Since George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, we can set up the following equation to find the original number of candies George had:

\[ \text{Original number of candies George had} - 5 = 3 \]

Solving for the original number of candies George had:

\[ \text{Original number of candies George had} = 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Now, we know that Nick had twice as many candies as George originally had. Therefore, we can calculate the number of candies Nick had as follows:

\[ \text{Number of candies Nick had} = 2 \times \text{Original number of candies George had} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we add 2 to Alyana's age:

\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Anne is \(\boxed{8}\) years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is:
   \[
   50 \text{ mm} - 5 \text{ mm} = 45 \text{ mm}
   \]
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \text{ mm} = 62 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm} = 188 \text{ mm}
\]

Thus, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - $18 is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy gets \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) dollars.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy initially has $6.
   - He adds $5 to his share: \( 6 + 5 = 11 \) dollars.
   - He adds another $10 the following day: \( 11 + 10 = 21 \) dollars.
   - He spends $8: \( 21 - 8 = 13 \) dollars.

3. **Tripling the Amount:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending $8: \( 13 \times 3 = 39 \) dollars.

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is \( \boxed{39} \)."
"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we start by noting that April has 30 days. Therefore, the first half of April consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the next 15 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April. Consequently, in the second half of April, he saves \( 2x \) each day.

The total savings for the first half of April is:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings for the second half of April is:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

Elvis's total savings for the month of April is the sum of his savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

Since \( x \) is the amount saved each day in the first half, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Thus, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples, oranges, and peaches that Verna bought.

1. **Cost of apples:**
   \[
   3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50 \text{ per apple} = 3 \times 1.50 = \$4.50
   \]

2. **Cost of oranges:**
   \[
   5 \text{ oranges} \times \$0.80 \text{ per orange} = 5 \times 0.80 = \$4.00
   \]

3. **Cost of peaches:**
   \[
   6 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.75 \text{ per peach} = 6 \times 0.75 = \$4.50
   \]

Next, we add up the total cost of all the fruits:
\[
\$4.50 \text{ (apples)} + \$4.00 \text{ (oranges)} + \$4.50 \text{ (peaches)} = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

Thus, the change Verna received is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"To determine how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Jairus earns.
2. Calculate the total amount Jenny earns.
3. Find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings.

First, let's calculate Jairus's total earnings:
- Jairus earns $0.8 per task.
- He completed 20 tasks.
- Therefore, Jairus's total earnings are \(0.8 \times 20 = 16\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate Jenny's total earnings:
- Jenny earns $0.5 per task.
- She completed 20 tasks.
- Therefore, Jenny's total earnings are \(0.5 \times 20 = 10\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings:
- Jairus's earnings are $16.
- Jenny's earnings are $10.
- The difference is \(16 - 10 = 6\) dollars.

Thus, Jairus will get \(\boxed{6}\) dollars more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"To determine how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day.
2. Multiply the daily distance by the number of days he works in a week.

First, we know that Jeff's work is 3 miles away. Since he walks to work and back home each day, the distance he walks in one day is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles (to work)} + 3 \text{ miles (back home)} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles he walks in a week. Since he works 5 times a week, we multiply the daily distance by 5:
\[ 6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ miles/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Jeff walks in a week is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Writing the alphabet in full twice:**
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it in full once: \(26\) letters.
   - Writing it in full twice: \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Writing half of the alphabet once:**
   - Half of the alphabet is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) letters.
   - Writing half of the alphabet once: \(13\) letters.

3. **Re-writing everything she has already written:**
   - The total number of letters written so far is the sum of the letters written in the first two steps: \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.
   - Re-writing everything: \(65\) letters.

4. **Calculating the total number of letters written:**
   - The total number of letters is the sum of the letters written in the first two steps and the letters re-written: \(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Cost of five notebooks: \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\)
- Cost of two pens: \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\)
- Cost of one calculator: \(1 \times \$12 = \$12.00\)
- Cost of one geometry set: \(1 \times \$10 = \$10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[
\$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00
\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$30.00 = 0.10 \times \$30.00 = \$3.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[
\$30.00 - \$3.00 = \$27.00
\]

Therefore, the final amount Daniel has to spend is:
\[

"To calculate Antonella's earnings based on the given commission structure, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. **Calculate the commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission amount = $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

2. **Calculate the commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold $2500 in total, so the amount over $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
   - Commission rate for the amount over $1000 is 10%.
   - Commission amount = $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

3. **Calculate the total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission for the first $1000 + Commission for the amount over $1000.
   - Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450.

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water. Since it takes him 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, we can calculate the time it takes in warm water as follows:

\[ \text{Time in warm water for 1 mile} = 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ \text{Time for 3 miles in cold water} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ \text{Time for 3 miles in warm water} = 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:

"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily. Since the daily recommended amount is 8 cups (because Juan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks and his recommended amount is 4 cups), Octavia drinks half of that:

\[ \text{Octavia's daily coffee intake} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks:

\[ \text{Juan's current daily coffee intake} = 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, the reduction needed is:

\[ \text{Reduction needed} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ cups} \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \(\boxed{36}\) cups."
"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then sum them up.

Next, let's calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- The total number of rodents is \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Thus, the total number of rodents in the pet shop is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Therefore, Susan's weight is:
   \[
   150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Therefore, Bob's weight is:
   \[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle from the ground to the sun after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the tip of the pyramid.

1. **Initial Angle**: The initial angle from the ground to the sun is the same as the angle of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees.

2. **Rate of Movement**: The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour straight upward.

3. **Time**: The sun moves for 10 hours.

4. **Total Movement**: The total movement of the sun in 10 hours is:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

5. **Final Angle**: The final angle from the ground to the sun is the initial angle plus the total movement:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is \(\boxed{82}\) degrees."
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. Therefore, the age of the younger son is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of candles required. Since each son needs one candle per year, the total number of candles needed is:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so the number of packs required is:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

"First, let's calculate how many pages Judy read in the first week.

Judy read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, we are directly given that she read 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"Let's denote the current age of Shiloh's nephew as \( x \).

According to the problem, Shiloh is currently 44 years old. In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old. At that time, he will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, in 7 years, Shiloh's nephew will be \( x + 7 \) years old, and we can set up the following equation based on the information given:

\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

1. Distribute the 3 on the right side of the equation:
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]

2. Subtract 21 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]

3. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently \(\boxed{10}\) years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00.
   - Therefore, for three teeth, the total is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as she had given for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Since the previous three teeth each received $1.00, half of that is \( \frac{1}{2} = 0.50 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, for two teeth, the total is \(2 \times 0.50 = 1\) dollar.

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Adding these together:
\[ 5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \]

So, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is \(\boxed{9.00}\) dollars."

Let's define the variables:
- \( R \) = the number of goals Richie scored
- \( M \) = the number of goals Mark scored
- \( A \) = the number of goals Anna scored

From the problem, we know:
1. Richie scored 80 goals, so \( R = 80 \).
2. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so \( R = M + 20 \).
3. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so \( R = A + 45 \).

Since \( R = 80 \), we can substitute this value into the other equations to find \( M \) and \( A \).

From the second equation:
\[ 80 = M + 20 \]
\[ M = 80 - 20 \]
\[ M = 60 \]

From the third equation:
\[ 80 = A + 45 \]
\[ A = 80 - 45 \]
\[ A = 35 \]

Now, we know the number of goals each teenager scored:
- Richie scored 80 goals.
- Mark scored 60 goals.
- Anna scored 35 goals.

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add these values together:
\[ 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much money Mitchell made from selling lemonade. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, the total amount of money Mitchell made is:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that Liam made $63. To find out how much more money Mitchell made compared to Liam, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, Mitchell made \(\boxed{21}\) more dollars than Liam that weekend."
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and plans to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we calculate his daily spending as follows:

\[
\text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
\]

Next, we calculate how much money Peter spends from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends $10 each day for 4 days, the total amount spent from Sunday through Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Total spent from Sunday to Wednesday} = 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we determine how much money Peter has left after Wednesday. Since he started with $70 and spent $40 from Sunday to Wednesday, the remaining amount is:

\[
\text{Remaining money} = 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

For the rest of the week (Thursday and Friday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $30 is:

\[
\text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter buys wooden action figures which cost $5 each. The number of wooden action figures he can buy with $40 is:

\[
\text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{40}{5} = 8
\]

Adding the number of wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[
\text{Total action figures} = 8 + 15 = 23
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"To determine the total cost of the kitten so far, we need to add up the costs of spaying the kitten, the vaccines, and the broken vases.

1. **Spaying cost**: $200
2. **Cost of 3 vaccines**: Each vaccine costs $20, so for 3 vaccines, the cost is:
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
3. **Cost of broken vases**: Each vase costs $12, and the kitten broke 4 vases, so the cost is:
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48
   \]

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total cost:
\[
200 + 60 + 48 = 308
\]

Thus, the total cost so far is:
\[
\boxed{308}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops each week:

- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many roses Ford grows in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, we calculate:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses per month} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of roses needed to supply all the flower shops in a month:
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 260 \text{ roses per month} \]

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the number of roses he can grow in a month from the number of roses needed:
\[ 260 \text{ roses needed} - 160 \text{ roses grown} = 100 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, Ford lacks \(\boxed{100}\) roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To determine how much money Katina will have in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Katina removes from her account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total amount from her initial savings.

First, we know that Katina removes $100 from her account every month. There are 12 months in a year, so over 2 years, the total number of months is:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money removed over these 24 months:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times \$100/\text{month} = \$2400 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial savings of $3000:
\[ \$3000 - \$2400 = \$600 \]

Therefore, the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue, total costs, and then subtract the total costs from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

2. **Calculate the total costs:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf of bread makes 10 sandwiches, and each loaf costs $3.00.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments
     - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total costs
     - Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

**Final numerical answer:**
$37.00"
"First, let's determine the total number of crayons Kate has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each:

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

   \text{Cost of carpet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2592
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the padding:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of removal} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of installation} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = \$7344

"First, let's determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is \(468 - 450 = 18\). The percentage by which the oven is off is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage off} = \left(\frac{18}{450}\right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This means the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature. To find the correct setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine the temperature that would result in the oven being 4% higher. Let \(x\) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. The actual temperature would then be \(x + 0.04x = 1.04x\). We want this to be 520 degrees:

\[
1.04x = 520
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

So, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the durations of both movies together. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we convert the duration of each movie into minutes:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
  \[
  60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes, the second movie is:
  \[
  120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[
90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is:
\[
\boxed{215}

"First, we need to determine the value of Juan's house. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from the original price.

Herb's house price: $76,000

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

So, Juan's house is:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

Now, we add the value of Juan's house and Herb's house to find the combined value:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. Since a dozen is 12, Judy brought 12 cups.
2. Judy also bought twice as many dishes as cups. Therefore, she brought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes, so the total number of utensils she brought is \(12 + 24 = 36\).
- Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 44 dishes, so the total number of utensils her friend brought is \(40 + 44 = 84\).

Adding the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend, we get:
\[36 + 84 = 120\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of 2 boxes of contacts with the current discount.

1. The original price of one box is $100.00.
2. The discount is 10%, so the discount amount per box is \(100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00\).
3. The price of one box after the discount is \(100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00\).
4. Therefore, the cost for 2 boxes is \(90.00 \times 2 = 180.00\).

Next, we need to find out how many single use contacts are in 2 boxes.

5. Each box contains 90 single use contacts.
6. So, 2 boxes contain \(90 \times 2 = 180\) single use contacts.

Now, we calculate the cost per single use contact when buying 2 boxes.

7. The total cost for 2 boxes is $180.00.
8. The total number of single use contacts in 2 boxes is 180.
9. The cost per single use contact is \(\frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00\).

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts, and assuming a pair consists of 2 single use contacts:

10. The cost per pair of contacts is \(1.00 \times 2 = 2.00\).

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is \(\boxed{2.00}\)."

- Saturday: Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours
- Sunday: Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
- Total hours for John: \(4 + 3 = 7\) hours

Next, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John.

**Jill's Earnings:**
- Rate: $10 per hour
- Total earnings: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars}\)

**John's Earnings:**
- Rate: $10 per hour
- Total earnings: \(7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars}\)

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

**Difference in Earnings:**
- John's earnings: $70

"First, let's calculate the total calories burned from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: \(2 \, \text{hours} \times 500 \, \text{calories/hour} = 1000 \, \text{calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \, \text{hour} \times 600 \, \text{calories/hour} = 600 \, \text{calories}\)

Next, we add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
\[1000 \, \text{calories} + 600 \, \text{calories} = 1600 \, \text{calories}\]

Now, we calculate the amount of water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned:
\[\frac{1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 8 \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 800 \, \text{ml}\]

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink \(\boxed{800}\) ml of water."
"Let's define the variables for the number of jelly beans of each color:
- Let \( B \) be the number of blue jelly beans.
- Let \( R \) be the number of red jelly beans.
- Let \( G \) be the number of green jelly beans.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so \( R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \).
2. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so \( G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \).

We also know the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500. \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the total equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500. \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500. \]

Solving for \( B \), we get:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500. \]

Now we can find \( R \) and \( G \):
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485, \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515. \]

The problem asks how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30. \]

Thus, the number of green jelly beans that is more than the number of red jelly beans is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"Let's denote Jerry's current age by \( x \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x = 2(x - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
1. Distribute the 2 on the right side:
\[ x = 2x - 10 \]
2. Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \) on one side:
\[ x - 2x = -10 \]
\[ -x = -10 \]
3. Multiply both sides by -1 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be \(\boxed{13}\) years old in 3 years."

**Final Answer:**
George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle by \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Colby has in each type of coin:

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth 25 cents. Colby has 8 quarters.
   \[
   8 \times 25 = 200 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth 10 cents. Colby has 6 dimes.
   \[
   6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth 5 cents. Colby has 14 nickels.
   \[
   14 \times 5 = 70 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth 1 cent. Colby has 15 pennies.
   \[
   15 \times 1 = 15 \text{ cents}
   \]

Next, we add up all the cents to find the total amount of money Colby has:
\[
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents}
\]

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
\[
345 \div 5 = 69
\]

Therefore, Colby can buy \(\boxed{69}\) gumballs."
"To determine the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then sum them up.

1. **Dogs**: Each dog has 4 legs. There are 5 dogs.
   \[
   5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 20 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Cats**: Each cat has 4 legs. There are 2 cats.
   \[
   2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs per cat} = 8 \text{ legs}

"First, we need to determine the rate at which the plane is traveling. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. The rate (speed) can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it would take an additional \(\boxed{5}\) hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \text{Pounds Ruiz makes per hour} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolate Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in one hour:

\[ \text{Pounds Marissa makes per hour} = 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ \text{Pounds together per hour} = 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we calculate the total amount of chocolate they made together in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total pounds in 12 hours} = 105 \times 12 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate they made together is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Howard spends each day.

On Monday, Howard spends $8.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from his original amount:

"First, let's calculate the earnings from the first four hours:

- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.
- Therefore, in one hour, he earned \( 15 \times 0.50 = 7.50 \) dollars.
- Over four hours, he earned \( 4 \times 7.50 = 30 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours:

- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
- Therefore, in one hour, he earned \( 10 \times 0.60 = 6.00 \) dollars.
- Over two hours, he earned \( 2 \times 6.00 = 12 \) dollars.

Now, we add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:

- Total earnings = \( 30 + 12 = 42 \) dollars.

"To determine how many years before the tires need to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per mile:**
   \[
   \text{Rotations per mile} = 725 \text{ rotations/2 miles} = 362.5 \text{ rotations/mile}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   \[
   \text{Rotations per month} = 362.5 \text{ rotations/mile} \times 400 \text{ miles} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   \[
   \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of years before the tires need to be replaced:**
   \[
   \text{Years before replacement} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washings per bottle:**
   - The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.

2. **Calculate the number of washings per pump:**
   - Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, the number of washings per pump is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
     \]

3. **Determine the cost per washing:**
   - The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings. Therefore, the cost per washing is:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost per pump:**
   - Since each pump provides 60 washings, the cost per pump is:
     \[
     0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \times 60 \text{ washings per pump} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
     \]

5. **Convert the cost per pump to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, the cost per pump in cents is:
     \[

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the initial 5 months and the subsequent months.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Total cost for the first 5 months: \( 5 \times 100,000 = 500,000 \) dollars.

2. **Subsequent months:**
   - The research takes 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the total duration of the research is \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \) months.
   - Therefore, the number of subsequent months is \( 50 - 5 = 45 \) months.
   - Each subsequent month, the funding required is 50% more than the previous month. This means the funding increases by a factor of \( 1.5 \) each month.

The cost for each of the subsequent months can be calculated as follows:
- Month 6: \( 100,000 \times 1.5 \)
- Month 7: \( 100,000 \times 1.5^2 \)
- Month 8: \( 100,000 \times 1.5^3 \)
- And so on...

This forms a geometric series where the first term \( a = 100,000 \times 1.5 \) and the common ratio \( r = 1.5 \).

The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series is given by:
\[ S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]

Here, \( n = 45 \), \( a = 100,000 \times 1.5 \), and \( r = 1.5 \).

First, calculate the first term \( a \):
\[ a = 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000 \]

Now, calculate the sum of the series:
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1} \]
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{0.5} \]
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 (1.5^{45} - 1) \]

Next, we need to calculate \( 1.5^{45} \). Using a calculator:
\[ 1.5^{45} \approx 1,148,698.13 \]

Now, substitute this value back into the sum formula:
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 (1,148,698.13 - 1) \]
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 \times 1,148,697.13 \]
\[ S_{45} \approx 344,609,139 \]

Finally, add the cost of the initial 5 months to the cost of the subsequent 45 months:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 500,000 + 344,609,139 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} \approx 345,109,139 \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is:
\[ \boxed{345,109,139} \]"
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we add the ounces of meat consumed by the first, second, and third players:
\[6 + 8 + 16 = 30\]

Thus, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."

\text{Total cost} = \$10.00 + \$5.00 + \$6.00 + \$10.00 + \$2.00
\]

Adding these amounts step-by-step:
\[
\$10.00 + \$5.00 = \$15.00
\]
\[
\$15.00 + \$6.00 = \$21.00
\]
\[
\$21.00 + \$10.00 = \$31.00
\]
\[
\$31.00 + \$2.00 = \$33.00
\]

Thus, the total amount Scarlett spent is:
\[

   \]

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"First, let's determine the total amount of meat Prince needs to sell from the bull. The bull weighs 750 kg.

Next, we need to find out how much meat Prince sells in one day. Since he sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750 kg of meat. We do this by dividing the total weight of the meat by the amount of meat he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince \(\boxed{5}\) days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's determine the total number of seats in the auditorium. Since there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, the total number of seats is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we calculate the number of seats occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we have:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

The number of seats remaining after the administrators have taken their seats is:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. Therefore, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. So, the number of seats occupied by the students is:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Thus, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.
2. Calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections.
3. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.**

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection.
\[
4 \text{ street lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ street lights/intersection}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections.**

There are 4 intersections.
\[
24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights}
\]

**Step 3: Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights.**

There are 20 non-functioning street lights.
\[
96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights}

"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play times for each DVD and then sum them up.

First, let's find out how many times the first DVD can still be played:
- The first DVD can be played 1000 times in total.
- It has already been played 356 times.
- Therefore, the remaining play times for the first DVD are:
  \[
  1000 - 356 = 644
  \]

Next, let's find out how many times the second DVD can still be played:
- The second DVD can be played 1000 times in total.
- It has already been played 135 times.
- Therefore, the remaining play times for the second DVD are:
  \[
  1000 - 135 = 865
  \]

Now, we sum the remaining play times of both DVDs:
\[
644 + 865 = 1509
\]

Thus, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is:
\[
\boxed{1509}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial amount of gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum chewed at school**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum chewed on the way home and after dinner**: Jim chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Gum given to his sister**: Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. So, he gives:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After giving the gum to his sister, he has:
   \[
   14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

So, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"To determine Charmaine's current age, we start by noting that she will be 16 years old in 12 years. Therefore, her current age is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Current age} = 16 - 12 = 4 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now. Since she is currently 4 years old, we add 4 years to her current age:

\[ \text{Age in 4 years} = 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Thus, Charmaine will be \(\boxed{8}\) years old 4 years from now."
"First, let's calculate how much the baseball coach spent. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each. The total cost for the baseballs is:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h."
"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
     \[
     6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cars towed in the week:**
   - Add the number of cars towed in the first three days to the number of cars towed in the remaining four days:
     \[
     30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
     \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[

"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to make the comparison easier. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The height requirement to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Now, we need to find out how much more Adam needs to grow to reach 4 feet:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the remaining height he needs to grow into inches:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches if he grows 2 inches per year:

\[ 8 \text{ inches} \div 2 \text{ inches/year} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, the number of years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars:**
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500
   \]
   For 10 cars:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total profit:**
   Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **Calculate James's commission:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the total profit.
   \[
   \text{James's Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
   \]

Therefore, the amount James made is:
\[
\boxed{17500}

"First, we need to determine how many of the 100 riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so the remaining 40% must be men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, let's define the prices of the jewels based on the given information:

1. The price of a diamond Jewell is given as $2000.
2. The price of a gold Jewell is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond Jewell. Therefore, the price of the gold Jewell is:
   \[
   \text{Price of gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]
3. The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell. Therefore, the price of the silver Jewell is:
   \[
   \text{Price of silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

Now, we need to find the total price for all three jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = \text{Price of diamond Jewell} + \text{Price of gold Jewell} + \text{Price of silver Jewell} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Thus, the total price for all three jewels is \(\boxed{4800}\)."
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. **Snowflake Stamps:**
   Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

2. **Truck Stamps:**
   Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]

3. **Rose Stamps:**
   Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

4. **Total Stamps:**
   To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together:
   \[
   16 + 19 + 10 = 45
   \]

Thus, the total number of stamps Max bought is:
\[
\boxed{45}

   \text{Total cost} = \$60
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of classes} = 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10} = \$6
   \]

2. **Determine the maximum cost per class allowed by Manny's parents:**
   \[
   \text{Maximum cost per class} = \$10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost if Manny misses \( x \) classes:**
   \[
   \text{Number of classes attended} = 10 - x
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$60
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10 - x}
   \]

4. **Set up the inequality to ensure the cost per class does not exceed $10:**
   \[
   \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10

   \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Relationship Between Reggie and Lynn:**
   Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Let \( L \) represent the distance Lynn ran. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Reggie's distance} = L + 3
   \]
   Substituting the known distance Reggie ran:
   \[
   20 = L + 3
   \]

4. **Solving for \( L \):**
   To find \( L \), we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   L = 20 - 3 = 17

"To determine the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each person biked separately and then sum these distances.

First, we calculate the distance Alisa biked:
\[
\text{Distance Alisa biked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 12 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours}
\]
\[
12 \times 4.5 = 12 \times \left(4 + 0.5\right) = 12 \times 4 + 12 \times 0.5 = 48 + 6 = 54 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance Stanley biked:
\[
\text{Distance Stanley biked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours}
\]
\[
10 \times 2.5 = 10 \times \left(2 + 0.5\right) = 10 \times 2 + 10 \times 0.5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \, \text{miles}
\]

Now, we sum the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley:
\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance Alisa biked} + \text{Distance Stanley biked} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} = 79 \, \text{miles}

"To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time required to dig through the soil and the time required to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time required to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
- The time to dig through the soil is given by the formula: time = distance / rate.
- Therefore, the time to dig through the soil is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

Next, let's calculate the time required to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the speed through clay, which is \( \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \).
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
- The time to dig through the clay is \( \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \).

Now, we sum the times for digging through the soil and the clay:
- Total time = time to dig through soil + time to dig through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is \(\boxed{10}\) hours."

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month.
2. Calculate the total earnings for the first month.
3. Calculate the earnings for the second month.
4. Sum the earnings from both months to get the total amount made in two months.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400 in the first month, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the amount earned from green hats is:
   \[
   400 \times 2 = 800
   \]
   So, the total earnings for the first month are:
   \[
   400 + 800 = 1200
   \]

2. For the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the earnings for the second month are:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900
   \]

3. The total amount made in two months is the sum of the earnings from the first month and the second month:
   \[
   1200 + 900 = 2100
   \]

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:
\[
\boxed{2100}

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first hour costs $15.
- Each subsequent hour costs twice the first hour, which is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost for the first hour is $15, and the cost for the next two hours is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 15 + 60 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount James paid is:

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days required for Mike to read the entire 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

First, we calculate the total number of days required to read the book:
\[
\text{Total pages} = 200
\]
\[
\text{Pages per day} = 10
\]
\[
\text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20
\]

Mike needs 20 days to read the entire book. The assignment is to be completed within 30 days. Therefore, we need to find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading:
\[
\text{Days before the deadline} = 30 - 20 = 10
\]

Thus, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline. 

Final answer:

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   \[
   \text{Initial cost} = \$150,000
   \]

2. **Monthly Hanger Rental Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly hanger cost} = \$5000
   \]

3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly fuel cost} = 2 \times \text{Monthly hanger cost} = 2 \times \$5000 = \$10,000
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Maintenance Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly maintenance cost} = \text{Monthly hanger cost} + \text{Monthly fuel cost} = \$5000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000
   \]

5. **Total Annual Maintenance Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total annual maintenance cost} = \text{Total monthly maintenance cost} \times 12 = \$15,000 \times 12 = \$180,000
   \]

6. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Initial cost} + \text{Total annual maintenance cost} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

1. Let \( R \) be the time in minutes it took to cook rice.
2. Let \( P \) be the time in minutes it took to cook pork.
3. Let \( B \) be the time in minutes it took to cook beans.

From the problem, we know:
- It took 30 minutes to cook rice, so \( R = 30 \).
- It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
- Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \( B = \frac{P + R}{2} \).

First, substitute \( R = 30 \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[ P = 30 + 20 = 50 \]

Next, substitute \( P = 50 \) and \( R = 30 \) into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{50 + 30}{2} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Now, we need to find the total cooking time for all the food:
\[ R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total time it took to cook all the food is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

Thus, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs \(\boxed{3}\) dollars more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Since each sheep and each goose has one head, we can write the first equation as:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

Since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, we can write the second equation as:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the following system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( G \):
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Now, let's check the number of legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]
This confirms our solution is correct.

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

To find 20% of $5:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 5 = 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound per day. Therefore, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for the week:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars per pound} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Additionally, Roger buys a donut for $2. 

Now, we add the cost of the coffee and the donut:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \]

Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we need to first calculate the total amount Gus spent on the other items he bought. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Cost of the bag of chips:**
   - Gus bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each.
   \[
   2 \text{ bags} \times \$2.00 \text{ per bag} = \$4.00
   \]

2. **Cost of the bucket of fried chicken:**
   - The bucket of fried chicken costs $8.00.
   \[
   \$8.00
   \]

3. **Cost of the bottle of soda:**
   - The bottle of soda costs $1.00.
   \[
   \$1.00
   \]

Next, we sum the costs of these items:
\[
\$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00
\]

Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:
\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

Thus, the cost of the apple pie is:
\[
\boxed{7.00}

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

This means there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\]

Now, we know the amounts of money each person has:
- Rayna: $150
- Kassidy: $90
- Aurelia: $120

To find the total amount of money they have together, we add these amounts:

\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360
\]

If they decide to share the money equally, each person would get:

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for consistency. Since the growth rate is given in inches per day, we will convert the current height from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches.

The bamboo needs to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. The total growth needed is:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches.

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - When he returns, there are twice as many dogs as before, so the number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for 24 dogs.

3. **After Buying More Toys:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - When he returns again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he doesn't need to buy any more toys.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - Initially, he needed 8 toys.
   - Then he needed 12 more toys.
   - No additional toys were needed after that.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate Karen's earnings for these 6 hours. Since she earns $20 per hour, her total earnings for 6 hours are:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. The proportion can be written as:

\[
\frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}}
\]

Where \( x \) is the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes. We can solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying and then dividing:

\[
6x = 36 \times 96
\]

\[
x = \frac{36 \times 96}{6}
\]

First, calculate \( 36 \times 96 \):

\[
36 \times 96 = 3456
\]

Then, divide by 6:

\[
x = \frac{3456}{6} = 576
\]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes.

\[
\boxed{576}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 people (Jack and 8 other adults) in the elevator.

The weight of one adult is 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 80 \, \text{kg/adult} \times 8 \, \text{adults} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight to this, the total weight of 9 people is:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight exceeds the maximum load by:
\[ \boxed{20 \, \text{kg}} \]"
"Let's define the number of cookies each person has using variables:
- Let \( K \) be the number of cookies Katarina has.
- Let \( M \) be the number of cookies Max has.
- Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so \( K = M - 5 \).
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so \( M = C + 12 \).
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so \( S = M + 23 \).
4. Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( K = 68 \).

First, substitute \( K = 68 \) into the equation \( K = M - 5 \):
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Now, substitute \( M = 73 \) into the equation \( M = C + 12 \):
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Next, substitute \( M = 73 \) into the equation \( S = M + 23 \):
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now we know the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina has 68 cookies.
- Max has 73 cookies.
- The Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.
- Summer has 96 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add these amounts together:
\[ K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is \(\boxed{298}\)."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length. This means the length of the dress after the extension is \( x + 0.5x = 1.5x \).

Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the final length of the dress is \( 1.5x + 20 \) cm.

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To determine how long it took Chris to mow his lawn using a combination of ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes, we need to calculate the time taken for each half of the lawn and then sum these times.

First, let's convert the time taken for each mode into minutes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode, we can calculate the time for each half as follows:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \(\frac{60}{2} = 30\) minutes.
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) minutes.

Adding these times together gives the total time taken to mow the entire lawn:
\[30 + 20 = 50\]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Total time available**: John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school.
2. **Time taken to the library**: It takes them 6 minutes to get to the library.
3. **Time taken to the fire station**: It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.

First, we calculate the total time spent walking to the fire station:
\[
6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we subtract the time spent walking from the total time available to find out how much time they have left:
\[
30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, John and Jack have \(\boxed{11}\) minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To determine the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit separately and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples.
   - The price per kilo of apples is $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of apples is:
     \[
     1 \text{ kilo} \times 4 \text{ dollars/kilo} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas.
   - The price per kilo of bananas is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost of bananas is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times 2 \text{ dollars/kilo} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges.
   - The price per kilo of oranges is $3.
   - Therefore, the cost of oranges is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kilo} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Next, we sum the costs of all the fruits to find the total amount Catherine pays:
\[
4 \text{ dollars (apples)} + 4 \text{ dollars (bananas)} + 6 \text{ dollars (oranges)} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Catherine pays is:
\[
\boxed{14}

"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda baked. Since Celinda baked twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta baked 30 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

After baking, the pair ate 10 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left to be put in the box is:

\[ \text{Cookies left} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

So, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
1. \( W = T + 7 \)
2. \( W + T = 44 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( T \):
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins using the first equation:
\[ W = T + 7 \]
\[ W = 18.5 + 7 \]
\[ W = 25.5 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{25.5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends on his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Next, we need to convert the 3 hours before dinner into minutes:

3 hours = 3 × 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap:

180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40.

The cost of the five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Therefore, the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

So, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + 20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person has saved after 10 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months in 10 years is:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of coins Rong has saved in 120 months:

\[ \text{Rong's total savings} = 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Similarly, we calculate the total number of coins Neil has saved in 120 months:

\[ \text{Neil's total savings} = 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:

\[ \text{Total coins} = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.6x \]

The total bill \( x \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the amount John leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of one banana. We know that one apple costs $0.50 and one banana costs twice as much as an apple. Therefore, the cost of one banana is:
\[ 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange. We know that one orange costs three times as much as a banana. Therefore, the cost of one orange is:
\[ 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the bananas in the crate. There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost of the bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1.00 = 5.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the apples in the crate. There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost of the apples is:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the oranges in the crate. There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost of the oranges is:
\[ 7 \times 3.00 = 21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the bananas, apples, and oranges to find the total cost of the crate:
\[ 5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \boxed{32.00} \]"

"To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs currently available and then compare it to the total number of chairs required.

1. **Calculate the number of regular chairs:**
   The problem states that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of chairs currently available:**
   The total number of chairs is the sum of the high chairs and the regular chairs:
   \[
   8 + 40 = 48
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   The total number of chairs needed is the sum of the chairs for adults and babies. Since the problem does not specify the number of chairs required per adult or baby, we assume each person needs one chair. Therefore, the total number of chairs needed is:
   \[
   42 + 15 = 57
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   The number of additional chairs needed is the difference between the total number of chairs required and the total number of chairs currently available:
   \[
   57 - 48 = 9
   \]

"First, let's find out how many bucks there are in the field. Since 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks:

\[ \text{Number of bucks} = 50 \times \frac{50}{100} = 50 \times 0.5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points:

\[ \text{Number of 8 point bucks} = 25 \times \frac{20}{100} = 25 \times 0.2 = 5 \]

So, the number of 8 point bucks is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student step by step.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points.
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Betty's Points (Recheck):**
   We already calculated Betty's points as 65, so this is consistent.

5. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after these deductions. We start with her total paycheck and subtract the amounts she put into her retirement account and her car payment:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is:

\[ \boxed{720} \]"

- \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) drinks
- \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) snacks

Each drink and each snack costs $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]
And the total cost for the snacks is:
\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent on drinks and snacks:
\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

1. Let \( G \) represent the amount of gravel Gissela's truck can carry. According to the problem, \( G = 4000 \) pounds.
2. Let \( Gd \) represent the amount of gravel Gordy's truck can carry. The problem states that Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so \( Gd = G + 800 \). Substituting the value of \( G \), we get \( Gd = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \) pounds.
3. Let \( Gb \) represent the amount of gravel Gary's truck can carry. The problem states that the combined capacity of the three trucks is 11,600 pounds. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   G + Gd + Gb = 11600
   \]
   Substituting the values of \( G \) and \( Gd \) into the equation, we get:
   \[
   4000 + 4800 + Gb = 11600
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we have:
   \[
   8800 + Gb = 11600
   \]
   To find \( Gb \), we subtract 8800 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   Gb = 11600 - 8800 = 2800
   \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry. We know the following:

1. There are 8 males and 6 females.
2. Each female ate 3 dumplings.
3. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.
4. There were no leftovers, meaning all dumplings were eaten.

First, calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females:
\[
6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings per female} = 18 \text{ dumplings}
\]

Next, calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males:
\[
8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings per male} = 32 \text{ dumplings}
\]

Now, add the dumplings eaten by the females and the males to find the total number of dumplings cooked:
\[
18 \text{ dumplings} + 32 \text{ dumplings} = 50 \text{ dumplings}
\]

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:

\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Gerald received:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Julia received:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Gerald then spent $10 on a book. Therefore, the amount of money Gerald has left is:
\[ 60 - 10 = 50 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second. Therefore, the speed of the turtle is:

\[
\text{Speed of the turtle} = \frac{\text{Speed of the cat}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula for distance, which is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the speed of the turtle and the time:

\[
\text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}

"To determine how many additional hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to find out how much more money they need to raise. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. Therefore, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. From the information given, in the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. So, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200. Since they raise $700 per hour, the number of additional hours required is:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Therefore, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

So, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes:**
   - The city uses 40% of the river's water.
   - 80% of this water is used for industrial purposes.
   - Therefore, the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes is \( 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \) or 32%.

2. **Calculate the percentage of the river's water used by the city for non-industrial purposes:**
   - The city uses 40% of the river's water in total.
   - Out of this, 32% is used for industrial purposes.
   - Therefore, the percentage used for non-industrial purposes is \( 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8\%}

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we first need to find the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

1. **Calculate the production rate for chocolate ice cream:**
   - The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{chocolate}} = \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the production rate for vanilla ice cream:**
   - The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
   - Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{vanilla}} = \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total production in 48 hours:**
   - For chocolate ice cream:
     \[
     \text{Total}_{\text{chocolate}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
     \]
   - For vanilla ice cream:
     \[
     \text{Total}_{\text{vanilla}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total production of both types of ice cream:**
   \[
   \text{Total production} = \text{Total}_{\text{chocolate}} + \text{Total}_{\text{vanilla}} = 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
   \]

Thus, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is \(\boxed{3000}\)."

   5 \text{ croissants} \times \$3.00 \text{ per croissant} = \$15.00
   \]

2. **Cinnamon Rolls**: 
   \[
   4 \text{ cinnamon rolls} \times \$2.50 \text{ per cinnamon roll} = \$10.00
   \]

3. **Mini Quiches**: 
   \[
   3 \text{ mini quiches} \times \$4.00 \text{ per mini quiche} = \$12.00
   \]

4. **Blueberry Muffins**: 
   \[
   13 \text{ blueberry muffins} \times \$1.00 \text{ per blueberry muffin} = \$13.00
   \]

Next, we sum up the costs of all the items:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total bill:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total bill:
\[
\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00
\]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

**Final Answer: 6 scoops**"
"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in two weeks.
2. Determine how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks.
3. Determine how much candy Amy eats in two weeks.
4. Find out how much candy each has left after two weeks.
5. Calculate the difference in the amount of candy they have left.

First, we know that two weeks consist of 14 days.

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we determine how much candy each has left after two weeks:
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has:
\[ 100 - 56 = 44 \text{ pieces} \]
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has:
\[ 100 - 42 = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we find the difference in the amount of candy they have left:
\[ 58 - 44 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after two weeks, Amy has \(\boxed{14}\) more pieces of candy than Ginger."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries. The initial cost to go picking is $20, and then there's an additional cost of $1.5 per pound for the 30 pounds James picked.

The cost for the blueberries themselves is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the initial cost to go picking:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if James had bought the same amount of blueberries at the store. The price at the store is $2.5 per pound, and he picked 30 pounds.

The cost at the store would be:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, we find the difference between the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and the cost of picking them:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps per minute for each foot:
- When her arms are down, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute.
- When her arms are raised, she taps each foot at 200 taps per minute.

Next, we need to determine the time spent in each state:
- She dances for a total of 5 minutes.
- Her arms are raised for 2 minutes, and her arms are down for the remaining 3 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the taps for each foot during the time her arms are down:
- Right foot: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)

Next, let's calculate the taps for each foot during the time her arms are raised:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes.

First, let's convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. The length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet to inches as follows:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the 4 inches, the total length of one of Topher's shoes is:
\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars separately, and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \text{ cars}
\]

Each of these 16 cars has 4 windows, so the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars is:
\[
16 \times 4 = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \text{ cars}
\]

Each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, so the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is:
\[
24 \times 2 = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars:
\[
64 + 48 = 112 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[
\boxed{112}

Next, we need to find the total number of blue spools:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total number of blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools out of the total number of spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."

   - There are 3 sleeves in a box.
     \[
     3 \text{ sleeves per box} \times 8 \text{ smores per sleeve} = 24 \text{ smores per box}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**
   - Since one box can make 24 smores and we need 24 smores:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ smores needed}}{24 \text{ smores per box}} = 1 \text{ box}
     \]

Thus, the number of boxes of graham crackers needed is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"First, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

- Let \( D \) be Dora's age.
- Let \( F \) be Dora's father's age.
- Let \( M \) be Dora's mother's age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Dora is 15 years old, so \( D = 15 \).
2. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so \( F = 2D + 8 \).
3. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so \( M = F - 4 \).

Now, substitute \( D = 15 \) into the equation for \( F \):
\[ F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38. \]

Next, substitute \( F = 38 \) into the equation for \( M \):
\[ M = 38 - 4 = 34. \]

Now we have the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
- Dora's age \( D = 15 \)
- Dora's father's age \( F = 38 \)
- Dora's mother's age \( M = 34 \)

To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add these ages together:
\[ D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87. \]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is \(\boxed{87}\)."

"First, let's break down the weights of each book:

- Cindy's math books weigh 2 pounds each. Since the problem does not specify the number of math books, we'll assume there is only one math book for simplicity, unless otherwise stated. So, the weight of the math book is 2 pounds.
- Her science book also weighs 2 pounds.
- Her French book weighs 4 pounds.
- Her English book weighs 3 pounds.
- Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the books:

\[
2 \text{ (math book)} + 2 \text{ (science book)} + 4 \text{ (French book)} + 3 \text{ (English book)} + 6 \text{ (history book)}
\]

Adding these together:

\[
2 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17
\]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is \(\boxed{17}\) pounds."
"First, let's determine how many votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we calculate:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{50% of candidate A's votes} = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

So, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we calculate:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

1. **Giant cubes**: Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   \[
   3 \text{ giant cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   \[
   7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   \[
   8 \text{ small cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Next, we add up the total amount of water used:
\[
12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how many ounces he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:
\[
32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces}
\]

Therefore, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of books Steven has as \( S \).

Given that Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books, we can write:
\[ 2S = 20 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, Steven has 10 books.

Next, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, the number of books Alice has is:
\[ S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books, and Alice has 16 books. The difference is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money she spent is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To determine how many students like to play video games, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of students and the given categories:**
   - Total students: 50
   - Students who like to bake: 10
   - Students who like to play basketball: 5
   - Students who like to play music or play video games: \(50 - 10 - 5 = 35\)

2. **Define the variables for the students who like to play music and video games:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of students who like to play video games.
   - According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

3. **Set up the equation for the total number of students who like to play music or video games:**
   - The total number of students who like to play music or video games is the sum of the students who like to play video games and the students who like to play music.
   - Therefore, \(x + 10 = 35\).

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   x + 10 = 35
   \]
   \[
   x = 35 - 10

So, the number of students who like to play video games is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many birds Jeremy scared away. He scared away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 12 birds. We calculate this as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

So, 4 birds were scared away. This means the number of birds left in the backyard after Jeremy threw the stone is:

\[
12 - 4 = 8
\]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the birds that were still in the backyard. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:

\[
8 + 20 = 28
\]

So, the final number of birds in the backyard is:

\[
\boxed{28}

"First, let's determine the number of students in each class. Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2:

\[
\text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these students are girls. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, we calculate 40% of 40:

\[
\text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
\]

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[
\text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
\]

Thus, the number of boys in each class is:

\[
\boxed{24}

8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28
\]

Melissa has 28 grooming jobs in total. Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to divide the total number of grooming jobs by 7 to find out how many animals she will groom each day.

\[
\frac{28}{7} = 4
\]

Therefore, Melissa will groom \(\boxed{4}\) animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred for buying the packs of magic cards. He bought 3 packs at $1800 each:

\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, we need to determine the total value of the cards he received. He received two specific cards worth $4000 and $1000, respectively. Additionally, there are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each. The total value of these 30 cards is:

\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Adding the value of the two specific cards and the 30 cards together gives:

\[ 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

Therefore, the profit Mark made is:

\[ \boxed{1100} \]"

"First, we determine how many students are in each of the six groups by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:

\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

This means each of the six groups has 9 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for 12 groups, assuming each group should have the same number of students as the original groups (9 students per group):

\[ 12 \times 9 = 108 \]

So, to have 12 groups, we need a total of 108 students.

Since we only have 54 students, we need to calculate how many more students are required to reach 108:

\[ 108 - 54 = 54 \]

However, the question asks for how many more groups are needed, not how many more students. Since each group requires 9 students, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[ \frac{54}{9} = 6 \]

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during one week:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

So, the number of chairs rented during weekdays in one week is:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 60 \text{ chairs/day} = 300 \text{ chairs} \]

And the number of chairs rented during weekends in one week is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 100 \text{ chairs/day} = 200 \text{ chairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of chairs rented in one week is:
\[ 300 \text{ chairs} + 200 \text{ chairs} = 500 \text{ chairs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are rented in two 4-week months. Since there are 8 weeks in two 4-week months, we multiply the weekly total by 8:
\[ 500 \text{ chairs/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 4000 \text{ chairs} \]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"

   \text{Initial bananas} = 48
   \]

2. **Arnold steals half of the bananas:**
   Arnold steals half of the 48 bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, the number of bananas left with Gunther is:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24
   \]

3. **Gunther adds 25 more bananas:**
   Gunther adds 25 bananas to the remaining 24 bananas.
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49
   \]

4. **Arnold steals 12 more bananas:**
   Arnold steals 12 bananas from the 49 bananas.
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37
   \]

5. **Gunther adds 6 more bananas:**
   Gunther adds 6 more bananas to the 37 bananas.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Conversions:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.
   - The remaining small stickers = \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so she gets 20 large buttons from trading 20 large stickers.
   - The remaining large stickers = \(40 - 20 = 20\) large stickers.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons.
   - 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons Calculation:**
   - Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27 small buttons.
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60 small buttons.
   - Total small buttons = \(27 + 60 = 87\) small buttons.
   - Large buttons = 20 large buttons.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \(87\) small buttons and \(20\) large buttons, but since the question asks for the total number of buttons, and large buttons are not converted to small buttons in the final count, the answer is simply the sum of small buttons.
   - Therefore, the final numerical answer is \(87\)."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day.

1. On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
2. On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
3. On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we sum the matches from each day:
\[
2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7
\]

Thus, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Let's define the variables first. Let \( x \) be the number of votes against the new regulation. According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is given as 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, we have:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-Small Shirts:**
   - 11 students need extra-small shirts.

2. **Small Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of small shirts = \(2 \times 11 = 22\).

3. **Medium Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = \(22 - 4 = 18\).

4. **Large Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).

5. **Extra-Large Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = \(9 + 6 = 15\).

"To find out how much you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 bag, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of the discount.
2. Subtract the discount from the original price.

**Step 1: Calculate the discount amount.**

The discount is 5% of $140. To find 5% of $140, multiply $140 by 0.05 (since 5% = 5/100 = 0.05).

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \]

**Step 2: Subtract the discount from the original price.**

Subtract the discount amount from the original price of $140.

\[ \text{Price after discount} = 140 - 7 = 133 \]

So, the final amount you will pay after the discount is \(\boxed{133}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of songs in 20 playlists.
2. Determine the total duration of these songs.

First, we find the total number of songs in 20 playlists. Since each playlist contains 300 songs, we multiply the number of songs per playlist by the number of playlists:
\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we calculate the total duration of these 6000 songs. Since each song is 10 hours long, we multiply the total number of songs by the duration of each song:
\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is:
\[ \boxed{60000} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many people think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people is calculated as:
\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 60\% \times 40 = \frac{60}{100} \times 40 = 0.6 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:
\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine the total number of puppies Jana has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of Pomeranians:**

"First, let's determine how much money Ava gave to Jayden. Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance:

\[
\text{Amount given by Ava} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Next, we add the money Jayden originally had to the money given by Ava:

\[
\text{Total money Jayden has} = 70 + 45 = 115
\]

The cost of the camera is $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total money he has from the cost of the camera:

\[
\text{Amount needed} = 200 - 115 = 85
\]

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2} \) of what the first house needs, so it will need \( \frac{x}{2} \) cases.
- The third house will need double what the first house needs, so it will need \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{4x}{2} = \frac{7x}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7x}{2} = 250 \]

To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7x = 500 \]

Then divide both sides by 7:
\[ x = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The number of cases needed for the third house is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Since the problem asks for the final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{142.86} \]"

"Let's define the variables for the quantities involved:
- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of berries Ava collects.
- Let \( E_t \) be the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the number of seconds left on the timer when Ava finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( A_e = E_e + 8 \).
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( A_b = E_b + 3 \).
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma: \( A_t = E_t + 4 \).

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times \text{(number of enemies)} \).
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times \text{(number of berries)} \).
- Points from the timer: \( 30 \times \text{(seconds left on the timer)} \).

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the relationships we know:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is:

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \).

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying more fish, the total number of fish in the pond is:
\[ 3 + O + 4 + W = 7 + O + W \]

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]

Rearranging the equation to isolate \( O \):
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish added from the pet store is 17:
\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, solve for \( O \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute \( O = 17 - W \) into the first equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):
\[ O = 17 - 4 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

Thus, Bob bought 4 white fish. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"First, we need to determine the temperature during the night. The problem states that it is 33 degrees colder at night compared to the day. Since the temperature during the day is 45 degrees, we can calculate the night temperature as follows:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Carson needs to increase the temperature to ensure it does not fall below 32 degrees. The current temperature at night is 12 degrees, and we need to raise it to at least 32 degrees. The difference in temperature needed is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood burns and raises the temperature by 5 degrees, we need to determine how many logs are required to raise the temperature by 20 degrees. We do this by dividing the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn \(\boxed{4}\) logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of 9-person groups formed.
2. Calculate how many of these groups brought back seashells.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought back.

**Step 1: Determine the number of 9-person groups.**

The total number of people is 90, and each group consists of 9 people. So, the number of groups is:
\[
\frac{90}{9} = 10

"First, let's determine Jamie's regular pay for the first 8 hours of work. Jamie earns $20 per hour for the first 8 hours.

\[
\text{Regular pay} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160
\]

Next, we need to calculate the special hourly rate for the additional hours worked. The special rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate.

\[
\text{Special hourly rate} = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30/\text{hour}
\]

Jamie worked a total of 11 hours, so the additional hours she worked beyond the first 8 hours is:

\[
11 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we calculate the pay for the additional 3 hours at the special rate.

\[
\text{Pay for additional hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90
\]

Finally, we add the regular pay and the pay for the additional hours to find the total pay for the day.

\[
\text{Total pay} = \$160 + \$90 = \$250
\]

Thus, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on Tuesday."

\]

Thus, the total number of lions in the enclosure is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised at 25% off.

To find the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount} = 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ \text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price from the $50 bill:
\[ \text{Change} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Mike will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at each stage of his employment:

1. **Billy's starting hourly wage:**
   \[
   \text{Starting wage} = \$10 \text{ per hour}
   \]

2. **After 2 months, Billy's wage is increased by $0.50:**
   \[
   \text{Wage after 2 months} = \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
   \]

3. **On his first anniversary, Billy's wage is increased by $1.00:**
   \[
   \text{Wage on first anniversary} = \$10.50 + \$1.00 = \$11.50 \text{ per hour}
   \]

Next, we calculate Sally's starting hourly wage, which is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage:
\[
\text{Sally's starting wage} = \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
\]

Now, we calculate the earnings for both Billy and Sally over 20 hours of work:

1. **Billy's earnings:**
   \[
   \text{Billy's earnings} = 20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50 \text{ per hour} = \$230
   \]

2. **Sally's earnings:**
   \[
   \text{Sally's earnings} = 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = \$210

"To determine the total number of trees planted at the end of the reforestation campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- Each class has 25 students.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \( 25 \times 40 = 1000 \).
- Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is \( 1000 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \( 3 \times 40 = 120 \).
- Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is \( 120 \times 2 = 240 \).

Now, we sum the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers:

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks (14 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the first 2 weeks} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours she plays in the second part of her schedule. She plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week (7 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the next week} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we add the hours from both parts of her schedule to find the total hours she has played so far.

\[ \text{Total hours played} = 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours.

\[ \text{Hours still needed} = 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the relative speed of the second car with respect to the first car and then use that to find the distance between them after 2 hours.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the materials before the premium is added. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300, so the total cost of the materials is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials. A 30% premium means James pays an additional 30% of $900. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add this premium to the original cost of the materials to find the total amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final amount James paid is:

\[ \boxed{1170} \]"

1. **Calculate the number of third-graders who passed:**
   - 340 out of 500 third-graders passed.
   - Number of third-graders who passed = 340.

2. **Calculate the number of fourth-graders who passed:**
   - 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed.
   - Number of fourth-graders who passed = 40.

3. **Calculate the number of fifth-graders who passed:**
   - The pass rate for fifth graders is twice the fourth graders' pass rate.
   - Fourth graders' pass rate = 40/100 = 0.40.
   - Fifth graders' pass rate = 2 * 0.40 = 0.80.
   - Number of fifth-graders who passed = 0.80 * 400 = 320.

4. **Calculate the total number of students who passed:**
   - Total number of students who passed = 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700.

5. **Calculate the total number of students who took the test:**
   - Total number of students = 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

6. **Calculate the overall pass rate:**
   - Overall pass rate = (Total number of students who passed / Total number of students) * 100
   - Overall pass rate = (700 / 1000) * 100 = 70%.

The school's overall pass rate is **70%**."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these four students is:
  \[
  4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts}
  \]

- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these sixteen students is:
  \[
  16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed by all the students:
\[
6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}
\]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left at the end of the party, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\[
38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts}
\]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts. Therefore, the total amount of tea in gallons is:

"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 candies, which means he needed to get more candies to cover the shortfall. Since he couldn't have sold more than he had, this implies he must have ordered more candies. He ordered 100 more candies, so now he has:

\[100 \text{ (initial candies)} + 100 \text{ (additional candies)} = 200 \text{ candies}\]

Dale sold 150 candies out of the 200 he now has. To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has sold from the total number of candies he now has:

\[200 - 150 = 50\]

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Calculate the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find out the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
\frac{105}{0.25} = 105 \div 0.25 = 105 \times 4 = 420
\]

So, Felix climbed 420 branches during the week.

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
\frac{420}{7} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

   - Total time this friend plays: \( 1.5 \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Number of quarters this friend uses: \( \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

4. **Third Friend's Play Time:**
   - This friend can play half as long as Jack, so 10 minutes per quarter.
   - Total time this friend plays: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Number of quarters this friend uses: \( \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

5. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - First friend: 12 quarters
   - Second friend: 12 quarters
   - Third friend: 12 quarters
   - Total: \( 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 48 \text{ quarters} \).

6. **Total Money Used:**
   - Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total money used is \( 48 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables as follows:

- \( S \) = ounces of salt
- \( O \) = ounces of oil
- \( F \) = ounces of fragrance
- \( Z \) = ounces of citrus zest
- \( U \) = ounces of sugar

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so \( S = U \).
2. She uses twice as much oil as salt, so \( O = 2S \).
3. She uses twice as much salt as citrus zest, so \( S = 2Z \).
4. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so \( Z = F \).

Since the total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, we can write the equation:
\[ S + O + F + Z + U = 10 \]

Now, substitute the relationships into the total equation:
\[ S + 2S + F + Z + S = 10 \]
\[ 4S + F + Z = 10 \]

Since \( Z = F \) and \( S = 2Z \), we can substitute \( F \) and \( Z \) in terms of \( S \):
\[ F = Z = \frac{S}{2} \]

Now substitute \( F \) and \( Z \) into the equation:
\[ 4S + \frac{S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} = 10 \]
\[ 4S + S = 10 \]
\[ 5S = 10 \]
\[ S = 2 \]

Now that we have \( S = 2 \), we can find the other variables:
\[ O = 2S = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]
\[ F = Z = \frac{S}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]
\[ U = S = 2 \]

So, the amount of oil used is \( O = 4 \) ounces.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
\[
3 \text{ goats} \times \$500 \text{ per goat} = 3 \times 500 = \$1500
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
\[
2 \text{ cows} \times \$1500 \text{ per cow} = 2 \times 1500 = \$3000
\]

"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day.
2. Add the time from both days to get the total time in hours.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the time from both days to find the total time in hours:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we convert the total time from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total hours by 60:
\[ 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"

   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Therefore, the total number of tasks per day is:
     \[
     30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, the daily earnings are:
     \[
     150 \text{ tasks/day} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$180/\text{day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**

"Let's define the variables for the number of cards each person has:
- Let \( P \) be the number of cards PJ has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of cards Smendrick has.
- Let \( B \) be the number of cards Becca has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The total number of cards is 341:
   \[
   B + S + P = 341
   \]
2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick:
   \[
   B = S + 12
   \]
3. Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has:
   \[
   S = 3P
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( P \) into the first equation. First, substitute \( S = 3P \) into \( B = S + 12 \):
\[
B = 3P + 12
\]
Now substitute \( B = 3P + 12 \) and \( S = 3P \) into the total cards equation:
\[
(3P + 12) + 3P + P = 341
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
7P + 12 = 341
\]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[
7P = 329
\]
Divide both sides by 7:
\[
P = 47
\]
Now that we have \( P = 47 \), we can find \( S \) and \( B \):
\[
S = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141
\]
\[
B = S + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153
\]
So, the number of cards Becca has is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance across the highway, given that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance, the total speed of the 3 kangaroos combined can be calculated as follows:

Let the distance be \( D \) and the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \). The total speed of the 3 kangaroos is \( 3v \). Since they take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), we have:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 \]
\[ D = 54v \]

Now, we need to find the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance \( D \). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). The total speed of the four turtles is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \( t \) it takes for the four turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
\[ D = 2v \times t \]
Since we know \( D = 54v \), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[ 54v = 2v \times t \]
\[ t = \frac{54v}{2v} \]
\[ t = 27 \]

Therefore, it will take the four turtles \(\boxed{27}\) hours to travel across the highway."

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the reduced price of the laptop after the trade-in.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom.
3. Use the information that she still needs $50 to find out how much she already has.

First, the reduced price of the laptop after the trade-in is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). According to the problem, the total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom, is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

We know that after adding this total amount to the $50 she still needs, she will have enough to buy the laptop. Therefore, the total amount of money she has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Thus, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"

"First, let's determine the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces with 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, with 3 cows, the total milk production is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many more cows are required to produce the additional 10 liters:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

   - Length of glue left: \( 12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \) millimeters

2. **Second glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Fraction left: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Length of glue left: \( 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \) millimeters

3. **Third glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Fraction left: \( \frac{1}{2} \)
   - Length of glue left: \( 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \) millimeters

Now, we sum the lengths of the glue that is left in all three glue sticks:
\[ 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters} \]

Thus, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

- Cost of the car: $10000
- Cost of the phone: $800

Total cost = $10000 + $800 = $10800

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has:

- Money from working on weekends: $5000
- Money from his brother: $200

Total money Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, to find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the total money he has from the total cost:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Gabriel has
Money needed = $10800 - $5200 = $5600

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"To determine how much change Thea received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman.
2. Subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount of money given.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman. She gave four $20 bills, so we multiply 4 by 20:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount of money given. The hat cost $70, so we subtract 70 from 80:
\[ 80 - 70 = 10 \]

Therefore, the change Thea received is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig starts with. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he starts with:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( S_J \) be the number of socks Jack has.
- Let \( D_J \) be the number of dishes Jack has.
- Let \( S_P \) be the number of socks Peter has.
- Let \( D_P \) be the number of dishes Peter has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jack collected 60 dishes, so \( D_J = 60 \).
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so \( D_J = 2S_J \). Since \( D_J = 60 \), we can substitute to find \( S_J \):
   \[
   60 = 2S_J \implies S_J = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so \( S_P = 2S_J \). Since \( S_J = 30 \), we have:
   \[
   S_P = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so \( D_P = \frac{1}{2}D_J \). Since \( D_J = 60 \), we have:
   \[
   D_P = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30
   \]

Now, we need to find the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
\[
S_J + D_J + S_P + D_P = 30 + 60 + 60 + 30 = 180
\]

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is \(\boxed{180}\)."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the given information and categorize the students accordingly.

1. **Students good at math only**: 5 students
2. **Students good at English only**: 8 students
3. **Students good at both math and English**: Let's denote this number as \( x \).

The total number of students in the class is 20. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students:

\[
5 \text{ (math only)} + 8 \text{ (English only)} + x \text{ (both)} = 20
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
5 + 8 + x = 20
\]

\[
13 + x = 20
\]

\[
x = 20 - 13
\]

\[
x = 7
\]

So, there are 7 students who are good at both math and English.

To find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English:

\[
5 \text{ (math only)} + 7 \text{ (both)} = 12
\]

Thus, the number of students who are good at math is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such intervals fit into the total concert time, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group takes:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

So, the total time for each group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission, which is 10 minutes. The total concert time is 2 hours, which is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
\[ 120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we divide the available time by the time each group takes to find out how many groups can perform:
\[ \frac{110}{10} = 11 \]

So, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original investment.

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**
   \[
   P = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the annual interest rate (R):**
   The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original amount per year. Therefore, the annual interest rate is:
   \[
   R = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total interest over 3 years:**
   Since the interest is simple, it is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = P \times R \times T
   \]
   where \( T \) is the time in years. Here, \( T = 3 \):
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = 300 \times 225 = 67500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = 67500 \times 3 = 202500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount after 3 years:**
   The total amount is the sum of the principal and the total interest:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 202500 = 202800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[
\boxed{202800}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons, and then find the difference between these two quantities.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars:
- The total number of white shirts is 40.
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

Next, let's find the number of floral shirts with no buttons:
- The total number of floral shirts is 50.
- 20 of the floral shirts have buttons, so the number of floral shirts with no buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:
- The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30.
- The number of white shirts with no collars is 20.
- The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Thus, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 10 more than the number of white shirts with no collars. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"To determine how much the farmer will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of trays needed to hold all the eggs.
2. Determine the total earnings from selling the trays.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of trays needed.**

The farmer has 900 eggs, and each tray holds 30 eggs. We need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[
\text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total earnings.**

Each tray is sold for $2.5. Therefore, the total earnings from selling 30 trays is:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the farmer will earn \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year:**
   James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year.
   \[
   \text{Total pairs of shoes per year} = 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year}
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount spent on shoes in a year:**
   James spends $2640 on shoes each year.

3. **Calculate the average cost per pair of shoes:**
   To find the average cost per pair, divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs of shoes.
   \[
   \text{Average cost per pair} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Total pairs of shoes}} = \frac{2640}{24}
   \]

4. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{2640}{24} = 110
   \]

Therefore, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is \(\boxed{110}\)."
"First, calculate the total cost for the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost for the red food with the discount:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are getting $2 off for each basket of red food.
- Therefore, the cost per basket of red food after the discount is \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the red food is \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

Finally, add the total costs of the green and red food to find the overall total:
- Total cost for green food: $75
- Total cost for red food: $48
- Therefore, the total amount you have to pay is \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Year:**
   - The town will build 12 homes.

2. **Second Year:**
   - They will build three times the number of homes built in the first year.
   - Number of homes in the second year = \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Third Year:**
   - They will build double the total number of homes built in the first two years.
   - Total homes built in the first two years = \( 12 + 36 = 48 \).
   - Number of homes in the third year = \( 2 \times 48 = 96 \).

4. **Total Homes Built Over Three Years:**
   - Sum of homes built in each year = \( 12 + 36 + 96 \).

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[
12 + 36 + 96 = 144
\]

So, the total number of homes the town will have built over the next three years is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals mentioned in the problem:
- Let \( I \) be the age of the person (you).
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.

From the problem, we can write the following equations based on the given information:
1. You are three years younger than your brother:
\[ I = B - 3 \]
2. You are two years older than your sister:
\[ I = S + 2 \]
3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age:
\[ M = 3B - 1 \]
4. The sum of all their ages is 87:
\[ I + B + S + M = 87 \]

First, we can express \( S \) and \( M \) in terms of \( I \) and \( B \):
\[ S = I - 2 \]
\[ M = 3B - 1 \]

Now substitute \( S \) and \( M \) into the fourth equation:
\[ I + B + (I - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 2I + 4B - 3 = 87 \]
Add 3 to both sides:
\[ 2I + 4B = 90 \]
Divide the entire equation by 2:
\[ I + 2B = 45 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( I = B - 3 \)
2. \( I + 2B = 45 \)

Substitute \( I = B - 3 \) into the second equation:
\[ (B - 3) + 2B = 45 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 3 = 45 \]
Add 3 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 48 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now substitute \( B = 16 \) back into the equation \( I = B - 3 \):
\[ I = 16 - 3 \]
\[ I = 13 \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for the class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find the number of packs required, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he needs to ensure he has enough glue sticks, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to follow the changes in the amount of water passing through the river step by step.

1. **Initial amount of water:**
   The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After the first day of heavy rain:**
   The amount of water doubles. Therefore, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   4000 \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Increase on the third day:**
   On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:

"To solve this problem, we need to model the exponential growth of the infection over three days. Let's break it down step by step.

**Day 0:**
- Initially, 10 people are infected.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections on Day 1: \(10 \times 6 = 60\).
- Total number of infected people after Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\).

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections on Day 2: \(70 \times 6 = 420\).
- Total number of infected people after Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\).

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections on Day 3: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\).
- Total number of infected people after Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, the total number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Therefore, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

So, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

\[ \boxed{1520} \]"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

- She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges.
- She gave 3 oranges to her son.

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is \(12 - 9 = 3\).

**Final Answer: 3**"
"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. Therefore, in a year (which has 12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge. Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year. Wendy earns 36 badges and Amber earns 6 badges, so the difference is:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Thus, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a year."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the number of banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of gold coins.
2. Determine the number of silver coins based on the given relationship.
3. Calculate the total number of coins by adding the number of gold and silver coins together.

Given:
- Gretchen has 70 gold coins.
- There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find the number of silver coins, we solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Now, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins to find the total number of coins:
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Thus, the total number of coins Gretchen has is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"

   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of leftover burritos:**
   - Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered.
   \[
   600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos}
   \]

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the number of each type of car:
- Let \( R \) be the number of red cars.
- Let \( G \) be the number of green cars.
- Let \( B \) be the number of blue cars.
- Let \( Y \) be the number of yellow cars.

From the problem, we know:
1. The rink has 12 red cars, so \( R = 12 \).
2. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so \( G = R - 2 \).
3. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so \( B = 3G \).
4. The total number of cars is 75, so \( R + G + B + Y = 75 \).

First, substitute \( R = 12 \) into the equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, substitute \( G = 10 \) into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 12 \), \( G = 10 \), and \( B = 30 \) into the total number of cars equation:
\[ 12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75 \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 52 + Y = 75 \]

Solve for \( Y \):
\[ Y = 75 - 52 = 23 \]

So, the number of yellow cars is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"Let's define the number of books each person has with variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1.

From equation 3, we have \( A = F - 12 \). Substitute this into equation 2:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now substitute \( S = F + 13 \) and \( A = F - 12 \) into equation 1:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."
"First, let's determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 10 pounds, the carrots weigh:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of jello cups needed:**
   - There are 30 kids.
   - Each kid will have 4 jello cups.
   \[
   30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups}
   \]

2. **Determine how many boxes of jello are needed:**
   - One 3-ounce box makes 10 small jello cups.
   \[
   \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the jello:**
   - Each box costs $1.25.
   \[
   12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per box} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Greg will spend \(\boxed{15}\) dollars on jello."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:
\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back \(\boxed{500}\) dollars in change."
"First, we need to determine how much Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the total cost. We calculate Keenan's share as follows:

\[ 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the month is four weeks long, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. We do this by dividing Keenan's monthly cost by 4:

\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the first day:**
   Tobias ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces on the first day.
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of pieces remaining after the first day:**
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the second day:**
   Tobias ate 10 pieces on the second day.
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces remaining}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the third day:**
   Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces on the third day.
   \[
   \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of pieces Tobias has eaten so far:**
   \[
   24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Thus, the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is \(\boxed{48}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after his friend gave him 28 marbles.

Paul initially has 52 marbles. After receiving 28 more marbles from his friend, the total number of marbles Paul has is:
\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul loses \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he loses, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

So, Paul loses 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract the 20 marbles he lost from his total of 80 marbles:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Paul has left is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:**
   Isaias plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
   \]

2. **Determine the total revenue from selling the chickens:**
   Isaias sells each chicken for $50.
   \[
   180 \text{ chickens} \times 50 \text{ dollars per chicken} = 9000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the chickens:**
   Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the cost of the chickens he sold must be the total revenue minus the profit.
   \[
   \text{Cost of chickens} = 9000 \text{ dollars} - 2000 \text{ dollars} = 7000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the amount Isaias bought the chickens for is \(\boxed{7000}\)."
"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah and Mitchell sold in total. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sales were 32 glasses, the boys together sold:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \text{ glasses} \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses equally between the two:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ glasses each} \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final answer is:

"To determine the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the costs for each service and then sum them up.

1. **Hair Treatment Cost:**
   Iris spent $400 on her hair treatment.

2. **Manicure Cost:**
   The cost of the manicure is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the hair treatment cost.
   \[
   \text{Manicure Cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]

3. **Pedicure Cost:**
   The cost of the pedicure is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the manicure cost.
   \[
   \text{Pedicure Cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

4. **Total Cost:**
   Now, we sum up the costs of the hair treatment, manicure, and pedicure.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575

Thus, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is \(\boxed{575}\)."
"First, we need to calculate how much money Sarah will make from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and she can sell it for $2 per meter.

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2 \text{ per meter} = \$40 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and we need to know how many meters of the new rope Sarah plans to buy. Since the problem does not specify the length of the new rope, we will assume she buys the same length as the original rope, which is 20 meters.

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5 \text{ per meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah made from selling the original rope to find out how much money she will have left over.

\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation to find her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to solve for her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. Her age in \( x \) years will be \( 8 + x \). We set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side of the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 24 - 8 = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's break down the costs of each item:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - Total cost for bacon: \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \) dollars.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one packet of chicken: \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) dollars.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost for chicken: \( 6 \times 20 = 120 \) dollars.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost for strawberries: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

4. **Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of apples: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) dollars.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost for apples: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) dollars.

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
50 \text{ (bacon)} + 120 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 196 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
\[
65 - 196 = -131
\]

Since the total cost exceeds her budget, Kelly does not have any money left and in fact, she is short by $131. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-131}
\]"
"Let's denote the length of Elaina's usual concert as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concert, plus a 15-minute encore. The total runtime of the final concert is given as 65 minutes. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the length of Elaina's usual concerts is \(\boxed{25}\) minutes."

   \[
   160 - 80 = 80
   \]
4. He gives 30 toys to Nicky:
   \[
   80 - 30 = 50
   \]

So, after giving away all the toys, Argo has \(\boxed{50}\) toys left."
"To find the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of chimichangas made on each day.
2. Sum the number of chimichangas made on these three days.

First, we know the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday:
- On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Wednesday, they make 125 chimichangas.

Next, we need to find out how many chimichangas are made on Friday. According to the problem, they make twice as many chimichangas on Friday as they do on Tuesday and Wednesday:
- On Friday, they make \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we sum the number of chimichangas made on these three days:
\[ 125 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 250 \text{ (Friday)} = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means the remaining microphones that can be paired are:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be made from the 40 microphones that can be paired. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Birds nesting in the bushes:**
   Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

2. **Birds flying overhead:**
   The number of birds flying overhead is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the number of birds nesting in the bushes. 
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
   \]
   So, 4 birds are flying overhead.

3. **Birds feeding:**
   Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding.
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   So, 24 birds are feeding.

Now, we add up all the birds:
\[
6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34
\]

Therefore, the total number of birds Jerry counts is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many cookies Lani has left after she ate 5 cookies. She originally baked 55 cookies and ate 5, so we subtract 5 from 55:

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cookies are in each jar if she places the remaining 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. We do this by dividing 50 by 5:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, the number of cookies in each jar is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is:
\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is:
\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We do this by subtracting the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:
\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have \(\boxed{15}\) more petals than the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[
\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
\]

Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate the number of outdoor plants as follows:

\[
\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. Therefore, the number of flowering plants is:

\[
\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
\]

To find the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[
\boxed{25\%}
\]"
"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Let the speed of the thingamabob be \( x \) meters per second.
2. According to the problem, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11 times the speed of the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whatchamacallit is \( 11x \) meters per second.
3. We are given that the speed of the whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   11x = 121
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{121}{11} = 11
   \]
   So, the speed of the thingamabob is 11 meters per second.
5. The speed of the whirligig is 5 times the speed of the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:
   \[
   5x = 5 \times 11 = 55
   \]

The speed of the whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."
"Let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

- Let \( c \) be the cost of one carrot.
- The cost of the salad is $6.
- The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.

Ellen eats two carrots, one salad, and one yogurt every day. The total cost for these items is $11. We can write the equation for the total cost as:

\[ 2c + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2c + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):

\[ 2c = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ c = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot is \( \boxed{1} \) dollar."
"First, let's determine Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 per hour and received a raise of $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the number of hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Mark makes a week is:

\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Let \( K \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
- Let \( A \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.
- Let \( p_J \) be the payment Tasha received for mowing Joe's lawn.
- Let \( p_K \) be the payment Tasha received for mowing Kamala's lawn.
- Let \( p_A \) be the payment Tasha received for mowing Alba's lawn.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( K = 3J \) (Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's).
2. \( A = 5J \) (Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's).
3. \( p_J = 6 \) (Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work).

We need to find the total earnings from mowing lawns and then subtract this from the total earnings to find the earnings from lemonade sales. Let's denote the total earnings from mowing lawns as \( E \).

The total earnings from mowing lawns can be expressed as:
\[ E = K \cdot p_K + J \cdot p_J + A \cdot p_A \]

Since we don't have the specific payments for Kamala's and Alba's lawns, we can express the total earnings in terms of \( J \):
\[ E = 3J \cdot p_K + J \cdot 6 + 5J \cdot p_A \]
\[ E = J (3p_K + 6 + 5p_A) \]

We know the total earnings from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns is $80:
\[ 80 = \text{earnings from lemonade} + E \]

Since we don't have the specific values for \( p_K \) and \( p_A \), we can assume the simplest case where the payments for mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns are the same as Joe's, i.e., $6 each. This is a reasonable assumption given the lack of specific information.

So, \( p_K = 6 \) and \( p_A = 6 \):
\[ E = J (3 \cdot 6 + 6 + 5 \cdot 6) = J (18 + 6 + 30) = J \cdot 54 \]

Since \( J \) is the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, and we know the total earnings from mowing lawns is \( 54J \), we can find \( J \) by noting that the total earnings from mowing lawns must be a multiple of 6 (since each mowing pays $6). The simplest and most logical assumption is that \( J = 1 \) (since the problem does not specify otherwise).

So, \( E = 54 \cdot 1 = 54 \).

Therefore, the earnings from lemonade sales are:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we need to find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 71 kg, we can calculate Christian's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we need to determine Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight. Since Christian's weight is 79 kg, we can calculate Harry's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is \(\boxed{74}\) kg."

"Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha originally had as \( M \).

According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had \( 3M \) notebooks.

Martha then bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has \( M + 5 \) notebooks. We are told that after buying these notebooks, Martha has a total of 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ M + 5 = 7 \]

To find \( M \), we solve the equation:
\[ M = 7 - 5 \]
\[ M = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had:
\[ 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6 \] notebooks.

Now, after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has 7 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha now has compared to Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Therefore, Martha now has \(\boxed{1}\) more notebook than Joseph."
"First, let's determine how far Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we calculate the additional distance Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:

\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:

\[
50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

\[
\boxed{110}
\]"
"First, we need to account for the 4 cookies that Susan's husband took. Initially, Susan made 100 cookies. After her husband took 4 cookies, the number of cookies left is:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Next, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we perform the division:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get \(\boxed{16}\) cookies."
"To determine how many more pages Denise read compared to Daniel, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pages Denise read today:**
   - Daniel read 13 pages yesterday.
   - Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday.
   - Therefore, the number of pages Denise read today is:
     \[
     13 + 5 = 18 \text{ pages}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pages each person read:**
   - Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 18 pages today.
     \[
     10 + 18 = 28 \text{ pages}
     \]
   - Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today.
     \[
     13 + 0 = 13 \text{ pages}
     \]

3. **Determine the difference in the number of pages read:**
   - The difference between the number of pages Denise read and the number of pages Daniel read is:
     \[
     28 - 13 = 15 \text{ pages}
     \]

Thus, Denise read \(\boxed{15}\) more pages than Daniel."
"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement as the standard. Therefore, the total amount of soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup that will be consumed by Calvin, his wife, and their two children. Since both adults and children will each have one bowl, the total number of bowls needed is:
\[ 2 \text{ (adults)} + 2 \text{ (children)} = 4 \text{ bowls} \]

Since the total amount of soup is 4 adult bowls and 4 bowls are needed for the meal, there is no leftover soup after everyone has one bowl. Therefore, the number of times each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is:
\[ 0 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To determine how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- William bought 5 notebooks.

\[
\text{Cost of notebooks} = 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.
- William bought 1 ballpen.

\[
\text{Cost of ballpen} = 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
\]

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount William spent is \(\boxed{8.00}\)."
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we start by calculating the material required for each type of mask separately and then sum the totals.

First, we know that Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. Therefore, the amount of material needed for one small mask is:
\[
\frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ small masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per small mask}
\]
For 20 small masks, the material required is:
\[
20 \text{ small masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per small mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, we know that Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. Therefore, the amount of material needed for one large mask is:
\[
\frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ large masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per large mask}
\]
For 8 large masks, the material required is:
\[
8 \text{ large masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per large mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
\]

Adding the material needed for the small and large masks together, we get:
\[
10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the total amount of material Jo needs is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"First, let's break down Harold's daily activities and calculate the time spent on each:

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: Harold works 2 hours less than he sleeps. Therefore, the time he spends working is:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. **Walking the dog**: Harold walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we sum up the time spent on these activities:
\[
10 \text{ hours (sleeping)} + 8 \text{ hours (working)} + 1 \text{ hour (walking the dog)} = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[
24 \text{ hours} - 19 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age.
- Let \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, we have:
\[ D = 60 \]

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be \(\boxed{38}\) years old in 8 years."

\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Next, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of acres for both farms combined. We add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. This can be calculated as:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. Since he completes 40 packages per hour, in 8 hours he will complete:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. Therefore, his earnings for the day can be calculated by multiplying the number of packages he completes by his pay rate:

\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide 180 minutes by 30 minutes per bottle:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red balloons.
- Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There are 20 red balloons.

We can set up the following equation based on the information given:
\[ 2r + 3y = 58 \]
Since we know \( r = 20 \), we substitute 20 for \( r \) in the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]
Next, we solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( \boxed{6} \)."
"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first need to calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in a 30-day month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he drives:

   - Therefore, the time worked on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) hours.

3. **Thursday:**
   - Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday.
   - Therefore, the time worked on Thursday is \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours worked over the three days:

\[
5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the total number of hours Bruce works in all these three days is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had combined and then find out how much each of them received from their mother.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since the balloons are sold at $0.5 for 2 balloons, we can calculate the cost as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost per 2 balloons} = \$0.5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of sets of 2 balloons in 12 balloons} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of balloons} = 6 \times 0.5 = \$3
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of ice cream} = 2 \times 7 = \$14
   \]

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount of their combined allowances is $28. Let \( x \) be the amount each of them received from their mother. Therefore, the combined amount is:
\[
2x = 28
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{28}{2} = 14
\]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday.
2. Sum the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday.
3. Divide the total by the number of days (5 days) to find the average.

First, we know that on Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs. On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday. Therefore, the number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is:
\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \]
So, the total for Tuesday and Wednesday is:
\[ 78 + 78 = 156 \]

Next, we add the number of Junebugs removed on the other days:
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday:
\[ 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 \]

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total by the number of days (5):
\[ \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"First, calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
- The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, calculate the distance traveled by the car:
- The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, find out how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car
- Difference in distance = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

Here are the steps:

1. Count the number of building blocks: 31
2. Count the number of stuffed animals: 8
3. Count the number of stacking rings: 9
4. Add these numbers together to find the total number of toys before the bouncy balls: \(31 + 8 + 9 = 48\)
5. Subtract this total from the overall number of toys to find the number of bouncy balls: \(62 - 48 = 14\)

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as follows:
- Let \( P \) be the age of Peter.
- Let \( Q \) be the age of Paul.
- Let \( J \) be the age of Jean.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( P + Q + J = 100 \)
2. \( Q = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = Q + J \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( Q \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now we have \( P \) in terms of \( J \). We can substitute \( Q = J + 10 \) and \( P = 2J + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J = 20 \), we can find \( Q \) and \( P \):
\[ Q = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Balloons Given by Maria:**
   - Maria has 4 friends.
   - She gave each friend 2 water balloons.
   - Therefore, the total number of balloons given to her friends is:
     \[
     4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons}
     \]
   - Maria also gave herself 1 balloon.

2. **Total Balloons After Initial Distribution:**
   - Balloons given to friends: 8
   - Balloons given to Maria: 1
   - Total balloons at this point:
     \[
     8 + 1 = 9 \text{ balloons}
     \]

3. **Additional Balloons Given by Maria's Mom:**
   - Maria's mom gave each person (including Maria and her 4 friends) 3 more balloons.
   - Total number of people is:
     \[
     4 \text{ friends} + 1 \text{ Maria} = 5 \text{ people}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of additional balloons given is:
     \[
     5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons}
     \]

4. **Total Balloons After Additional Distribution:**
   - Balloons after initial distribution: 9
   - Additional balloons given: 15
   - Total balloons:
     \[
     9 + 15 = 24 \text{ balloons}
     \]

Thus, the total number of balloons the girls had is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and the boxes already owned by the charity group.

- Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes, so the total number of donated boxes is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes.
- They already have 10 boxes.

Adding these together, the total number of boxes is \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes.

- The total number of tables needed is \(60 \div 2 = 30\) tables.

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of new tables they need is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.

- Total distance spat by Zoey = \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Next, we find the combined total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney:
- Combined total distance = \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet

Now, we calculate the average total distance spat:
- Number of participants = 2
- Average total distance = \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is \(\boxed{410}\) feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the earnings from each machine over a period of 30 days, running 24 hours a day.

First, let's calculate the hourly earnings for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * $6/widget = $360/hour
- WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * $6/widget = $270/hour

Next, we calculate the daily earnings for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: $360/hour * 24 hours/day = $8640/day
- WidgetMaster 9000: $270/hour * 24 hours/day = $6480/day

Now, we calculate the monthly earnings for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: $8640/day * 30 days = $259,200
- WidgetMaster 9000: $6480/day * 30 days = $194,400

Finally, we find the difference in monthly earnings between the two machines:
- Difference: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 over a month."
"First, let's determine the total number of hours Cameron will stay at the hotel. Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This is a total of 17 hours.

Next, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the first 12 hours and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour. The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos. The number of additional hours is 17 - 12 = 5 hours. The cost for these additional hours is 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay. The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} - 1350 \text{ pesos} = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, Cameron would save \(\boxed{250}\) pesos."
"First, let's determine how much hay each sheep needs. According to the problem, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. Since there are 15 goats and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, the total amount of hay for the goats is:
\[15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. Since there are 12 sheep and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay, the total amount of hay for the sheep is:
\[12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}\]

Finally, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the overall total:
\[75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}\]

So, the total amount of hay Nate needs is \(\boxed{159}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the 5 pencils:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

"To determine the total charge for the job, we need to consider the fixed visit charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Fixed Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: The labor rate is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). Therefore, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total charge:
\[ \text{Total Charge} = \text{Fixed Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Cost} \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60 = 205 \]

Thus, the total charge for the job is \(\boxed{205}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. The amount he was out initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling 5 CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To determine how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

"To determine the total time it took James to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   James swims at half the initial speed.
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   Add the initial swimming time, rest time, and the time to swim the remaining distance.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}

"To determine Leo's age, we start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem.

1. Let \( D \) represent Deanna's age.
2. Let \( L \) represent Leo's age.
3. Let \( M \) represent Marcus's age.

From the problem, we know:
- Deanna is 26 years old, so \( D = 26 \).
- Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so \( M = D - 5 \).
- Marcus is half of Leo’s age, so \( M = \frac{L}{2} \).

First, we calculate Marcus's age using Deanna's age:
\[ M = D - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we use the relationship between Marcus's age and Leo's age to find Leo's age:
\[ M = \frac{L}{2} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{L}{2} \]

To solve for \( L \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ L = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

Thus, Leo is \(\boxed{42}\) years old."
"Let's define the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total points scored by the three individuals is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can translate this information into the following system of equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

2. The paper is stacked such that 100 pages make up 1 inch.

First, we calculate the number of pages per inch:
\[ \text{Pages per inch} = 100 \]

Next, we find out how many pages are in 1.5 inches by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches:
\[ \text{Total pages} = 100 \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Therefore, the book has:
\[ \boxed{150} \] pages."
"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert this time into minutes because Vince's rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate Kim's usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Determine the time Kim woke up that day:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - 6 a.m. minus 5 minutes is 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was asleep before she woke up to go to the bathroom:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes.
   - Convert 7 hours and 55 minutes to minutes: \( 7 \times 60 + 55 = 455 \) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \( 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 \) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep that day:**
   - Total time asleep = Time before waking up to go to the bathroom - Time sleepwalking
   - Total time asleep = \( 455 - 23 = 432 \) minutes.

Thus, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is \(\boxed{432}\)."

\[ \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to determine the number of beds that will be occupied after 2 weeks (14 days) if 50 patients are admitted each day:

\[ \text{Additional occupied beds after 14 days} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

So, the total number of occupied beds after 14 days will be:
\[ \text{Total occupied beds} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds:
\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

**Final Answer:**
100"
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder (the non-work emails) are sent to family. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails, which are not sent to family, are sent to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are sent to her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Now, we need to determine how many of these 3 remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. The problem states that one-third of the other emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we find out how old Shawna's father is. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, we calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the 20% overstatement by Courtney. If Courtney reported 48 people, and this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to the problem, Courtney's reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%).

This can be expressed as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

Performing the division:
\[ x = 40 \]

Thus, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried in terms of a variable. Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan. This can be expressed as:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then the relationship between the number of balls carried by each boy would still hold. If Jason carried 2 balls, then:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
Solving for \( J \), we get:
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find the number of balls carried by each boy:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls is:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[
\boxed{7}

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes dug by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

Next, the pirates filled in 2 holes on the third day:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, there were 29 holes. According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

The number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey each got as \(70\). Let \(x\) be the number of corn chips that Collins got. According to the problem, Collins received 15 more corn chips than the others, so Collins got \(70 + 15 = 85\) corn chips.

Now, we need to find the total number of corn chips. The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of corn chips as:
\[
70 + 70 + 85
\]

Adding these values together:
\[
70 + 70 = 140
\]
\[
140 + 85 = 225
\]

So, the total number of corn chips is:
\[
\boxed{225}

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets for travel. The problem states that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the tickets for travel is $600.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe, Stan, and Alex as \( A \), \( S \), and \( X \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. Together they have caught 339 Pokemon:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) into the first equation. First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify this to:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Distribute the 2:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokemon."
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. According to the problem, each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend watching all the episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

\[
\boxed{200}

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in each direction and then find the net distance.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Distance: \( 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance: \( 18 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 36 \, \text{miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Distance: \( 22 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 110 \, \text{miles} \)

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south and north:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles} \)
- Total distance traveled north: \( 36 \, \text{miles} \)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the difference between the total distance traveled south and the total distance traveled north:
\[ 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial Batch of Brownies:**
   Greta made one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. **Brownies from Office Party:**
   At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. **Brownies from Surprise Party:**
   When she arrived home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

4. **Total Brownies Before the Surprise Party:**
   Adding the brownies from the office party to the initial batch:
   \[
   12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (office party)} = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

5. **Brownies Eaten During the Surprise Party:**
   During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   \[
   1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

6. **Total Brownies Before the Surprise Party Eaten:**
   Adding the brownies eaten during the surprise party to the total from the office party and initial batch:
   \[
   18 \text{ (initial and office)} + 18 \text{ (surprise party)} = 36 \text{ brownies}
   \]

7. **Total Brownies Available:**
   Adding the brownies from the surprise party to the total before the surprise party:
   \[
   18 \text{ (initial and office)} + 48 \text{ (surprise party)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

8. **Brownies Left Over:**
   Subtracting the total brownies eaten from the total brownies available:
   \[
   66 \text{ (total available)} - 36 \text{ (total eaten)} = 30 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Thus, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"First, let's determine the age of Nani's brother. Since Nani is 8 years old and his brother is twice his age, the brother's age is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find the age of Nani's sister. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate:
\[ 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \text{ years} \]
So, Nani's sister is:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets is \(\boxed{227}\) minutes."
"To determine the total cost John paid for the phones, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of phones:**
   - John buys phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife.
   - Total number of phones = 1 (John) + 2 (kids) + 1 (wife) = 4 phones.

2. **Determine the price of each phone:**
   - The price of the first two phones is $600 each.
   - Each phone after the first two is half price, so the price of each of the remaining two phones is $600 / 2 = $300.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of the first two phones = 2 * $600 = $1200.
   - Cost of the remaining two phones = 2 * $300 = $600.

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wood slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister. Since she gave 2 boxes to each:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes (to mom)} + 2 \text{ boxes (to sister)} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining boxes. Calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 8 boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes she kept from the remaining boxes to find out how many boxes she sold:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 2 \text{ boxes} = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy.

1. The cost of the dictionary is $18.
2. The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
3. The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

Adding these amounts together gives:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39.

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books. He has already saved $14, so we subtract this from the total cost:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25 to afford the books. Since he earns $5 per hour, we need to find out how many hours he must work to earn $25. We do this by dividing the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work \(\boxed{5}\) hours to afford his books."
"Let's define the number of cherries each person has with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the number of cherries Richard has.
- Let \( J \) be the number of cherries Jerry has.
- Let \( B \) be the number of cherries Robert has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Robert has 30 cherries, so \( B = 30 \).
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so \( B = R + 10 \). Since \( B = 30 \), we can substitute to find \( R \):
   \[
   30 = R + 10 \implies R = 20
   \]
3. The total number of cherries is 60, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   R + J + B = 60
   \]
   Substituting the known values of \( R \) and \( B \):
   \[
   20 + J + 30 = 60 \implies 50 + J = 60 \implies J = 10
   \]
4. Now, we need to find how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
   \[
   B - J = 30 - 10 = 20

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both Saturday and Sunday, and then calculate the total earnings.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
1. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.
2. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie.

We can write the following equations based on the information given:
\[ G_S = 10 \]
\[ A_S = A_U - 4 \]
\[ G_U = G_S + 5 \]
\[ A_U = 15 \]

Now, substitute the known values into the equations:
\[ G_S = 10 \]
\[ A_U = 15 \]
\[ G_U = 10 + 5 = 15 \]
\[ A_S = 15 - 4 = 11 \]

Next, we calculate the earnings for each day:
- On Saturday, the earnings from gingerbread are \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \) dollars.
- On Saturday, the earnings from apple pie are \( 11 \times 15 = 165 \) dollars.
- On Sunday, the earnings from gingerbread are \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) dollars.
- On Sunday, the earnings from apple pie are \( 15 \times 15 = 225 \) dollars.

Now, we sum the earnings from both days:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (60 + 165) + (90 + 225) = 225 + 315 = 540 \]

Thus, the total amount Sunny earned for the two days is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need to pack, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use:**
   - Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She will be outside for 4 hours each day.
   - Over 8 days, the total number of hours she will be outside is:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is:
     \[
     32 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 32 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of bottles needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.
   - To find out how many bottles are needed, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount each bottle contains:
     \[
     \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Thus, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"First, let's calculate the price of the red car, which is 40% cheaper than the blue car.

The price of the blue car is $100. 

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( D \) be the current age of Emil's dad.
- Let \( B \) be the current age of Emil's brother.

We know that Emil is currently 19 years old. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years older than he is now. So, in 5 years, Emil's dad will be \( D + 5 \) years old, and Emil's brother will be \( B + 5 \) years old.

According to the problem, when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. This gives us two equations:
1. \( 24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5) \)
2. \( 24 = 2(B + 5) \)

Let's solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5) \]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]

Now, let's solve the second equation for \( B \):
\[ 24 = 2(B + 5) \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ B = 7 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old and his brother is currently 7 years old. The sum of their ages is:
\[ 43 + 7 = 50 \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother. So, her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave. So, her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

Now, we need to find the total number of beads Adrianne has. We do this by adding the beads given by her mother, her sister, and her friend:

\[
20 + 30 + 40 = 90
\]

So, the total number of beads Adrianne has is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we find the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class of 30 students are football players, we calculate:

So, 6 students are football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this as follows:

\[ 25\% \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are cheerleaders or part of the band.

Adding the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members gives us the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, determine the size of the boots Charlie wears. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, find the average size of the boots worn by both Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes together and then dividing by the number of people (which is 2 in this case):

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of the shoe worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the plants and the spacing to the same unit (feet):**
   - Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is \( \frac{12}{12} = 1 \) foot.
   - The space between each plant is 1.5 feet.

2. **Calculate the total space required for one plant and the space between it and the next plant:**
   - Total space for one plant and the space between it and the next plant is \( 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 \) feet.

3. **Determine the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is \( \frac{111}{2.5} = 44.4 \).
   - Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants needed:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \( 44 - 17 = 27 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \( 27 \times 6 = 162 \).

Therefore, Pat will spend **$162** at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"First, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half as many, we calculate:

\[ \text{Brother's daily consumption} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels} \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ \text{Brother's weekly consumption} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

So, Edgar's brother eats \(\boxed{63}\) pretzels in a week."
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of petunias for one basket:**
   - Each basket contains 3 petunias.
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   \[
   \text{Cost of petunias per basket} = 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of sweet potato vines for one basket:**
   - Each basket contains 2 sweet potato vines.
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   \[
   \text{Cost of sweet potato vines per basket} = 2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per vine} = \$5.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for one basket:**
   - Add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines for one basket.
   \[
   \text{Total cost per basket} = \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for all 5 baskets:**
   - Multiply the total cost per basket by the number of baskets.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 5 baskets} = 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations to find out how much soil is left:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil left, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes each month, which is the amount she sets aside. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy each month, we divide the amount she sets aside by the cost of one pair of shoes.

\[ \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \text{ pairs of shoes per month} \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs, which means she can buy 0.5 pairs of shoes each month. Over the course of a year (12 months), the total number of pairs of shoes she can buy is:

\[ 0.5 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the problem into two parts: peeling the shrimp and sautéing them.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we calculate the time required as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, we need to determine how long it will take. Since 90 shrimp is three times 30 shrimp, it will take three times 10 minutes:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté 90 shrimp} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to complete both tasks is the sum of the time to peel and the time to sauté:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is \(\boxed{45}\) minutes."
"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Next Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner is then turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ degrees/hour} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **Warming Up:**
   - After the air conditioner is turned off, the room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours.
   - Total warming during this period: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

4. **Net Temperature Change:**
   - Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Net temperature change: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\).

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final Answer:**
14 degrees."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet as \( D \).
   - According to the problem, Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. So, \( D = 30 \).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the Comet:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then his age when he saw the Comet for the first time is \( 90 - 75 = 15 \) years old.

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of electric bill checks per year is:
     \[
     1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

2. **Gas bill checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of gas bill checks per year is:
     \[
     1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

3. **Church checks:**
   - Buford writes two checks per month to the church.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of church checks per year is:
     \[
     2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

4. **Pest and lawn service checks:**
   - Buford writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service.
   - There are 4 quarters in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of pest and lawn service checks per year is:
     \[
     1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52 \text{ checks/year}
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:

"Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[
\frac{3}{4}F
\]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are:
\[
F - \frac{3}{4}F = \frac{1}{4}F
\]

Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{8}F
\]

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips. According to the problem, these 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[
44 = \frac{1}{2}F
\]

Solving for \( F \):
\[
F = 44 \times 2 = 88
\]

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \):
\[
\frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11
\]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl**: Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote's howl**: Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. Therefore, Chikote's howl lasts:
   \[
   2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]
3. **Igneous's howl**: Igneous howls for as long as the combined duration of Tobias's and Chikote's howls. Therefore, Igneous's howl lasts:
   \[
   20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total duration of all three wolves' howls combined:
\[
20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[
\frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total cost of the trousers.
2. Determine how much money Adam's mother gave him.
3. Determine how much money Adam's father gave him.
4. Calculate the total amount of money given by his parents.
5. Subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The total cost of the trousers is $30.
2. Adam's mother gave him $6.
3. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
4. The total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
5. The amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is the total cost of the trousers minus the total amount given by his parents, which is \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. Akbar's age \( A = 3 \) years.
2. Alessandro's age \( B = 4 \) years.
3. The total age of the children is 20 years, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age equation as:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. The amount collected from his neighbors is $500, and the amount collected from the online fund is $1500. Adding these together gives:

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else donates a total of $2000, the lawyer's contribution will be:

\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, we need to find half of 1500:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

This means 750 cookies were given to the church next door. If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is:
\[ 2 \text{ (adults)} \times 2x \text{ (each adult's slice)} + 4 \text{ (kids)} \times x \text{ (each kid's slice)} = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \( 8x \).

Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on his inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time spent on rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time spent on his 10 appointments. Each appointment takes 30 minutes, so:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes into hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones has 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the 8 hours spent on rounds and appointments from the total 9 hours gives:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready by 5:00 pm, we need to calculate the total time required for all the steps and then work backwards from the target completion time.

1. **Cooling time**: 2 hours
2. **Frosting time**: 10 minutes
3. **Baking time**: 30 minutes
4. **Making the batter time**: 20 minutes

First, let's add up all the times:
- Cooling: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting: 10 minutes
- Baking: 30 minutes
- Making the batter: 20 minutes

Total time required = 120 + 10 + 30 + 20 = 180 minutes

Convert 180 minutes into hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, subtract this total time from the target completion time of 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

**Final Answer: 2:00 pm**"
"To determine how many chocolate bars are in a box, we start by defining the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars. Peter sold 4.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Thus, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session.
2. Calculate the total cost per day.
3. Calculate the total cost per week.
4. Calculate the total cost per month, assuming a month has 4 weeks.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per session.**

The cost per session includes the studio rental and the cost per student. The studio rental is $25, and the cost per student is $1.50. With 10 students, the cost per session is:
\[ 25 + 1.50 \times 10 = 25 + 15 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost per day.**

The dance studio is rented 3 days a week, so the total cost per day is:
\[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost per week.**

Assuming the dance studio operates 5 days a week, the total cost per week is:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost per month.**

Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the total cost per month is:
\[ 600 \times 4 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes and then find the difference.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( p \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes.
- Let \( m \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes.

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
  \[
  4p = 64
  \]
- Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
  \[
  7m = 56
  \]

Next, we solve these equations for \( p \) and \( m \):
\[
p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]
\[
m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Thus, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find out how many porcupine babies are born each month. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since we are asked to find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to calculate the total number of babies born in one year. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. Adding the number of babies born in a year to the initial population gives us the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]

\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Number of gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Number of gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we need to find the number of each type of stick and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks:**
   - The number of red sticks is given as 9.

2. **Blue Sticks:**
   - The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of blue sticks is \( 9 + 5 = 14 \).

3. **Yellow Sticks:**
   - The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is \( 14 - 3 = 11 \).

4. **Total Number of Sticks:**
   - Sum the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks.
   - Total = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
   - Total = \( 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \).

"First, we calculate the distance traveled by Matteo. Matteo's speed is 55 miles per hour and he traveled for 4 hours. The distance traveled by Matteo is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Distance traveled by Matteo} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by Shandy. Shandy's speed is 45 miles per hour and she traveled for 10 hours. The distance traveled by Shandy is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Distance traveled by Shandy} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo. We do this by subtracting the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy:
\[ \text{Difference in distance} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Shandy drove \(\boxed{230}\) miles farther than Matteo."
"To determine the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students:**
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 3000
   \]

2. **Number of students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students over 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

3. **Number of male students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375
   \]

4. **Number of female students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

5. **Number of students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

6. **Number of male students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

7. **Number of female students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students:**
   \[
   \text{Total female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is:
\[
\boxed{1875}

"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run in one hour based on the information given.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so:
   \[
   \text{Trey's laps} = 10 + 4 = 14
   \]
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so:
   \[
   \text{Shaelyn's laps} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so:
   \[
   \text{Quinn's laps} = 7 - 2 = 5
   \]

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Bethany's laps} - \text{Quinn's laps} = 10 - 5 = 5
\]

Therefore, Bethany can run \(\boxed{5}\) more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) of what Wanda pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on the first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   \[

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge percentage to the initial charge percentage when Maria went to the park.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 3 hours of losing 7% of its capacity each hour, the power bank was at 28%.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of the 3-hour period.
   - Each hour, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity, so it retains 93% of its capacity each hour.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]

3. **Charge Before the 3-Hour Period:**
   - Before the 3-hour period, the power bank was at \( x \) (which we found to be approximately 0.348 or 34.8%).
   - This charge was after 5 hours of losing 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of the 5-hour period.
   - Each hour, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity, so it retains 91% of its capacity each hour.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solving for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y \times 0.624032 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.557
   \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 55.7\% \).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{55.7\%}

"First, let's calculate Janet's total hourly earnings from both wages and tips:

\[ \text{Hourly earnings} = \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Janet wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of $10,000:

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times \$10,000 = \$2,000 \]

Now, we calculate how much Janet earns in a week by working 40 hours:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$1,000 \]

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000/\text{week}} = 2 \]

So, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased.

- The cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- The cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- The cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- The cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, we add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10. After purchasing the items, the amount of money he has left is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide $0.75 by $0.25:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, let's determine the total number of sweets Anne has. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is:
\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \]

Next, Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of sweets in these 2 packs is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

So, the number of sweets left to be given to her friends is:
\[ 900 - 120 = 780 \]

Anne gave these 780 sweets equally to her 10 friends. Therefore, the number of sweets each friend received is:
\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price after \( n \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she evenly distributed 72 pictures into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits only. This means there are:

\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]

albums that are either selfies or portraits. Since each of these 5 albums contains 9 pictures, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \]

Thus, the total number of portraits and selfies Olivia had is:

\[
\boxed{45}

"First, we need to determine how long it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can find the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[
\text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[
\text{Time for 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the total time James spends reading is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of guests:**
   The hotel starts with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkouts:**
   24 guests elected to check out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

3. **Late checkouts:**
   15 guests elected to check out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

4. **Afternoon check-ins:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests checked in}
   \]
   Adding these to the remaining guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91 \text{ guests}
   \]

5. **Additional check-ins after dinner:**
   7 more people checked in after dinner.
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98 \text{ guests}
   \]

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is:
\[
\boxed{98}

1. On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
3. On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we add the number of bananas picked each day:
\[4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22\]

So, the total number of bananas John has is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions = 60
   - Percentage of easy questions = 40%
   - Number of easy questions = \( 40\% \times 60 = 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \)
   - Number of average and difficult questions combined = \( 60 - 24 = 36 \)
   - Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, the number of average questions = number of difficult questions = \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct.
   - Number of easy questions Aries gets correct = \( 75\% \times 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \)
   - Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct.
   - Number of average questions Aries gets correct = \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
   - Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct.
   - Number of difficult questions Aries gets correct = \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)

3. **Calculate the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Total correct answers = Number of easy questions correct + Number of average questions correct + Number of difficult questions correct
   - Total correct answers = \( 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 \)

Therefore, the number of points Aries is sure to get is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
- Let \( y \) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Each small stuffed animal costs $4.
2. Each large stuffed animal costs \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.
3. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \( y = 2x \).
4. The total earnings from the sales were $120.

We can set up the equation for the total earnings:
\[ 12x + 4y = 120 \]

Since \( y = 2x \), we substitute \( 2x \) for \( y \) in the equation:
\[ 12x + 4(2x) = 120 \]
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( y = 2x \), we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the equation for \( y \):
\[ y = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% = 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% = 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (since 100% - 40% = 60%)
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% = 0.20
   - Combined probability = 60% * 20% = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum these probabilities to find the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.102 \]

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we subtract this total from 1 (or 100%):

\[ 1 - 0.102 = 0.898 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.898 \times 100 = 89.8\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[ \boxed{89.8\%} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} + 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 1250 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

**Final Answer:**
Each graduate would receive 5 tickets."
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat:**
   - It is given that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Since it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up, the number of medium-sized jelly beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

2. **Determine the number of small jelly beans equivalent to the medium-sized jelly beans:**
   - It is given that eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized jelly beans is:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450
     \]

Thus, the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \(\boxed{450}\)."

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $6 and Ted buys 3 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the total cost of the books and the total cost of the pencils to find the total amount Ted spent:
\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Ted spent is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - The number of intervals between bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \) intervals.
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Determine the time to drop the candy in each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is \( 8 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \).

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \(\boxed{40}\) seconds."
"First, we need to determine the total number of apples Uncle Franky has. Since there are forty apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, we can calculate the total number of apples as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of apples he can make if each pack contains eight apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, the number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make is:

\[

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total cost of his education and then determine how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new income.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year.
   - He attends college for 4 years.
   - Total loan amount = $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working:**
   - Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year.
   - He did not work for 4 years.
   - Total income lost = $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total cost (loans + income lost):**
   - Total cost = $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (income lost) = $300,000.

4. **Determine Jim's new income after earning a college degree:**
   - His income tripled.
   - Original income = $25,000/year.
   - New income = $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

5. **Calculate the time to earn the total cost:**
   - Total cost to be earned = $300,000.
   - New income = $75,000/year.
   - Time to earn the total cost = $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece. The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For one fabric piece:
\[ A = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:**
   - On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.
   - On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday is \(\frac{425}{5} = 85\).
   - Therefore, the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is \(85 + 17 = 102\).

2. **Determine the number of letters delivered on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is \(2 \times 102 = 204\).
   - Therefore, the number of letters delivered on Wednesday is \(204 + 5 = 209\).

3. **Calculate the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - The total number of letters delivered is the sum of the letters delivered on each day.
   - This is \(425 + 102 + 209 = 736\).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average over the three races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Loss in the first race: \(-5\).

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Amount won in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\).
   - Win in the second race: \(+11\).

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).
   - Loss in the third race: \(-16.5\).

Now, let's sum up the total amount lost or won over the three races:
\[
-5 + 11 - 16.5
\]

First, add the amounts:
\[
-5 + 11 = 6
\]
Then subtract the loss in the third race:
\[
6 - 16.5 = -10.5
\]

The total net loss over the three races is \(-10.5\).

To find the average loss per race, divide the total net loss by the number of races (3):
\[
\frac{-10.5}{3} = -3.5
\]

So, the average loss per race is \(-3.5\).

**Final Answer:**
\[

"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America.
2. Calculate the total population by multiplying the number of cities by the number of people in each city.

First, we know there are 26 countries in South America and each country has 5 cities. Therefore, the total number of cities in South America is:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, we know that each city has 1000 people. So, the total population of South America is:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is:
\[ \boxed{130000} \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll convert everything to inches since the growth is given in inches and Xavier's original height is also in feet.

1 foot = 12 inches.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall. Converting this to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the fraction of the day worked into hours:**
   - A full day has 24 hours.
   - The painters worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day.
   - Therefore, the number of hours worked per day is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days worked:**
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days worked is:
     \[
     3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each painter worked 9 hours per day.
   - The team consists of 4 painters.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team per day is:
     \[
     9 \times 4 = 36 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Over 21 days, the total number of hours worked by the team is:
     \[
     36 \times 21 = 756 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of hours each painter worked:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Therefore, the number of hours each painter worked is:
     \[
     \frac{756}{4} = 189 \text{ hours}

"Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms. First, we find a common denominator for the terms involving \( x \):
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we combine the \( x \) terms by converting \( 2x \) to a fraction with a denominator of 2:
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
\frac{4x + x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and \( n = 3 \) years.

Let's calculate the value step by step:

1. Calculate the retention rate: \( 1 - 0.21 = 0.79 \).
2. Apply the retention rate for 3 years: \( 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \).

Now, let's compute \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Then, multiply this by the initial value:
\[ 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, we need to find out how many books are written in Spanish. We do this by subtracting the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the number of Spanish books is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Bernice has already driven. She drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days. So, we multiply 325 by 4:

\[ 325 \times 4 = 1300 \text{ kilometers} \]

Next, we need to find out how many kilometers are left for Bernice to drive. The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers. We subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:

\[ 1955 - 1300 = 655 \text{ kilometers} \]

So, the number of kilometers Bernice still needs to drive is:

\[ \boxed{655} \]"
"First, calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people descend from the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is \(\boxed{110}\)."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Tank top cost**: $10

"To calculate the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of tiles needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their price.

**Step 1: Determine the number of tiles needed.**

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles required is:
\[ 200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The insurance cost increased by 60% from the normal cost of $120.

The increase in cost is calculated as:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost of the insurance is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the annual cost James pays for the insurance is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used per week:**
   - Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.
   - Therefore, the total number of sheets used per week is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (twin sheets)} + 1 \text{ (king sheet)} = 5 \text{ sheets per week}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of sets of sheets used per week:**
   - Since each twin bed uses 2 sheets and the king bed uses 2 sheets, the number of sets used per week is:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sheets}}{2 \text{ sheets per set}} + \frac{1 \text{ king sheet}}{2 \text{ sheets per set}} = 2 \text{ (twin sets)} + 0.5 \text{ (king sets)} = 2.5 \text{ sets per week}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of loads needed per week:**
   - The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time.
   - Since 2.5 sets are used per week, we need to round up to the next whole number of loads because partial loads are not possible.
   - Therefore, the number of loads per week is:
     \[
     \lceil 2.5 \rceil = 3 \text{ loads per week}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of loads per year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of loads per year is:
     \[
     3 \text{ loads per week} \times 52 \text{ weeks per year} = 156 \text{ loads per year}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices each person ate and then sum these amounts.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( B \) be the number of slices Becky ate.
- Let \( J \) be the number of slices Jake ate.
- Let \( S \) be the number of slices Silvia ate.

From the problem, we know:
1. Becky ate 10 slices, so \( B = 10 \).
2. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so \( B = J + 3 \).
3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so \( S = 2J \).

Since \( B = 10 \), we can substitute this into the second equation:
\[ 10 = J + 3 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using the third equation:
\[ S = 2J = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

So, the number of slices each person ate is:
- Becky: 10 slices
- Jake: 7 slices
- Silvia: 14 slices

To find the total number of slices eaten, we sum these amounts:
\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( D \) be the number of minutes Donovan's part took.
- Let \( B \) be the number of minutes Betsy's part took.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part.
2. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ B = D + 18 \]
\[ B + D = 98 \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (D + 18) + D = 98 \]
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we solve for \( D \):
\[ 2D = 98 - 18 \]
\[ 2D = 80 \]
\[ D = 40 \]

Now that we know \( D = 40 \), we can find \( B \) using the first equation:
\[ B = D + 18 \]
\[ B = 40 + 18 \]
\[ B = 58 \]

So, Betsy's part took \(\boxed{58}\) minutes."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's visit cost**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is:
   \[
   300 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of painkillers**: Each painkiller costs $4, and she needs 30 painkillers, so the total cost is:
   \[
   4 \text{ dollars/pill} \times 30 \text{ pills} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Parking cost**: The parking is charged at $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the cost is:
   \[
   6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add all these costs together to find the total cost:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482
\]

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:
\[
\boxed{482}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many emails James gets in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, this means 80% of the emails do require a response.

The number of emails that require a response each day is:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. We do this by multiplying the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is:
\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many classes as on Monday.
   \[
   2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ classes}
   \]
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many classes as on Monday.
   \[
   3 \times 32 = 96 \text{ classes}
   \]
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:
\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]
\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]
\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]
\[
222 + 25 = 247
\]

Thus, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:
\[
\boxed{247}

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all tests and then divide by the number of tests.

1. Calculate the total score for the first 3 tests:
   \[
   100 + 100 + 100 = 300
   \]

2. Add the score of the 4th test:
   \[
   300 + 80 = 380
   \]

3. Divide the total score by the number of tests (which is 4) to find the average:
   \[
   \frac{380}{4} = 95
   \]

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is \(\boxed{95}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left from their order.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left from their order.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of the small coupons and the cost of the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the number of meatballs in the initial order:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - \(7 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 28 \text{ meatballs}\).

3. **Determine the number of meatball sub sandwiches Mark ate:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(7 - 4 = 3\) meatball sub sandwiches remaining.

4. **Calculate the number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches before Sidney ordered more:**
   - \(3 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

5. **Determine the number of additional meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - \(3 \text{ additional sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

6. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches after Sidney's additional order:**
   - \(12 \text{ meatballs from remaining sandwiches} + 12 \text{ meatballs from additional sandwiches} = 24 \text{ meatballs}\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"First, let's determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver their load. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Determine the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is:
     \[
     4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - Since 1.5 pounds of butter costs $6.00, we need to find out how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds.
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}
   \]
   - The total cost for 4 sets is:
     \[
     4 \times 6.00 = 24.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{24.00}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we need to account for the fact that 4 people said they could not come. Therefore, the number of people who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the rental fee and the cost for the additional guests gives us the total cost:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Maggie and Riza each originally had.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation for Maggie's original amount of money as follows:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \text{ of Maggie's original money} = 60
\]
To find Maggie's original amount of money, we solve for it:
\[
\text{Maggie's original money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation for Riza's original amount of money as follows:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \text{ of Riza's original money} = 60
\]
To find Riza's original amount of money, we solve for it:
\[
\text{Riza's original money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

Now, we calculate how much money each of them spent:
- Maggie spent:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
\]
- Riza spent:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

Next, we determine how much money each of them has left:
- Maggie has $60 left.
- Riza has $60 left.

Finally, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:
\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Thus, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys each day:
\[10 + 14 = 24\]

Since the three monkeys together eat 315 bananas in a week, we can find out how many bananas they eat each day by dividing 315 by 7:
\[315 \div 7 = 45\]

This means the three monkeys together eat 45 bananas each day. Since the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas each day, the third monkey eats:
\[45 - 24 = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"To determine the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed, we need to consider the pieces he completed in each of the two puzzles.

1. For the first puzzle, Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle. Therefore, the number of pieces he placed is:
   \[
   \frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. For the second puzzle, Teddy completed the entire 500 piece puzzle. Therefore, the number of pieces he placed is:
   \[
   500 \text{ pieces}
   \]

To find the total number of pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the pieces from both puzzles:
\[
250 + 500 = 750 \text{ pieces}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{750}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five $5 bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the cost of 15 roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to buy 15 roses at the per-rose price. Instead, we should check if she can buy 15 roses at the price of a dozen roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, she can buy one dozen roses and 3 individual roses. The cost for one dozen roses is $15, and the cost for 3 individual roses is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]
So, the total cost for 12 roses and 3 individual roses is:
\[ 15 + 6 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the change Jenny will receive. She has $25 and the total cost is $21, so her change is:
\[ 25 - 21 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in $1, so in $4 there are:
\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the earnings from each type of item sold and then sum these amounts.

   - Total earnings from milkshakes: \( 6 \times 5.50 \)

   \[
   6 \times 5.50 = 33.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the earnings from burger platters:**
   - Terry sells 9 burger platters.
   - Each burger platter is sold for $11.
   - Total earnings from burger platters: \( 9 \times 11 \)

   \[
   9 \times 11 = 99.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the earnings from sodas:**
   - Terry sells 20 sodas.
   - Each soda is sold for $1.50.
   - Total earnings from sodas: \( 20 \times 1.50 \)

   \[
   20 \times 1.50 = 30.00
   \]

4. **Sum the earnings from all items:**
   - Earnings from milkshakes: $33.00
   - Earnings from burger platters: $99.00
   - Earnings from sodas: $30.00

   \[
   33.00 + 99.00 + 30.00 = 162.00

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves after 30 minutes (10 minutes to arrive + 20 minutes to stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after the first train leaves).
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) minutes.
   - Leaves after 35 minutes (30 minutes after the first train leaves + 5 minutes to stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 65 minutes after the first train leaves (65 minutes after the first train leaves).
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (20 minutes after the third train leaves).
   - This is 85 minutes after the first train leaves (65 minutes + 20 minutes).

Paul will board the fourth train 85 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, Paul will have to wait 75 minutes (85 minutes - 10 minutes) for his train.

"First, let's calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to collect to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks required:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks."
"First, let's determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price of $2000.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch. The original price of the watch was $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800.

The discount amount is:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of seconds in one hour is:
     \[
     60 \text{ seconds/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds/hour}
     \]
   - For 4 hours, the total number of seconds is:
     \[
     3600 \text{ seconds/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 14400 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates one jellyfish every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create:
     \[
     14400 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create:
     \[
     14400 \text{ jellyfish/spring} \times 5 \text{ springs} = 72000 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is:

"To find Frankie's score, we start by defining the relationship between Frankie's score and Binkie's score. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. Let's denote Binkie's score by \( B \) and Frankie's score by \( F \).

Given:
\[ B = 90 \]

The relationship between their scores can be expressed as:
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is \(\boxed{195}\)."
"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to consider the total distance he walked and his walking speed.

1. **Calculate the total distance walked:**
   - James walked halfway to the store, which is \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \).
   - He then walked back home, which is another 2 miles.
   - He then walked from home to the store again, which is another 4 miles.
   - Therefore, the total distance walked is \( 2 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} + 4 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   - James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
   - The time taken to walk a distance is given by the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \).
   - Substituting the values, the total time taken is \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \).

Thus, the total time it took James to reach the store is \(\boxed{2}\) hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times 0.80 \text{ dollars per banana} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00 and she bought 10 bunches, the total cost is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars per bunch} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's define the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[
\frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, we use this growth rate to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years:

\[
2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."

"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[ \text{Total class time per day} = 8 \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total class time for the week is:

\[ \text{Total class time per week} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on these days.

\[ \text{Extra learning time per week} = \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the class time and the extra learning time to get the total learning time per week:

\[ \text{Total learning time per week} = 1600 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 1700 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the total learning time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

\[ \text{Total learning time in hours} = \frac{1700 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:

\[ \boxed{28.33} \]"
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial drop height is:
   \[
   3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
   \[
   72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
   \[
   48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:
\[
\boxed{32 \text{ feet}}
\]"
"Let's break down the heights step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child's height in inches is:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child. So, the second child's height is:
   \[
   72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child. So, the third child's height is:
   \[
   74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child. So, the fourth child's height is:
   \[
   69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is \(\boxed{72}\) inches."
"To determine how much the orchard earned from selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bags sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of bags sold.**

Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:
\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples per bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total earnings.**

Each bag is sold for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"To determine the original amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms of meat that were left after the scavenging and eating by the T-Rex and the velociraptors.

1. **After the Allosaurus ate:**
   - The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat.
   - Before the Allosaurus ate, the remaining meat was twice the amount the Allosaurus ate.
   - Therefore, the amount of meat before the Allosaurus ate is:
     \[
     270 \times 2 = 540 \text{ kilograms}
     \]

2. **After the velociraptors scavenged:**
   - The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate.
   - This means that the 540 kilograms is the other half that was left after the velociraptors scavenged.
   - Therefore, the amount of meat before the velociraptors scavenged is:
     \[
     540 \times 2 = 1080 \text{ kilograms}
     \]

3. **After the T-Rex ate:**
   - The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops.
   - This means that the 1080 kilograms is the other half that was left after the T-Rex ate.
   - Therefore, the original amount of meat on the triceratops is:
     \[
     1080 \times 2 = 2160 \text{ kilograms}
     \]

Thus, the original amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate is \(\boxed{2160}\) kilograms."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall.

The north and south walls are both 10 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are both 5 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together, we get the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

The cost of one gallon of paint is $12, so the total cost for 12 gallons is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Total sodas: 12
   - Shaken sodas: 3
   - Unshaken sodas: 9

2. **Ellen's Actions:**
   - Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - Remaining sodas: 11
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 8
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 3

3. **Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - Remaining sodas: 9
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 6
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 2

4. **Ellen's Friend's Actions:**
   - Ellen's friend takes 1 soda from the remaining 9 sodas.

5. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - The probability that the soda taken by Ellen's friend is shaken is the number of remaining shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas.
   - Number of remaining shaken sodas: 2
   - Total number of remaining sodas: 9

   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{9}
   \]

6. **Converting to a Percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, multiply by 100.

   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right) \times 100 \approx 22.22\%
   \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately \(22.22\%\)."
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

1. **Calculate the speed of the second train:**
   - The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
   - The second train travels at half the speed of the first train.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the second train} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by each train in 3 hours:**
   - Distance is calculated using the formula: \(\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}\).

   For the first train:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

   For the second train:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance between the two trains:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}

"First, let's determine the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- Therefore, the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Next, we need to calculate how many days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off, so we calculate 20% of 50 days:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days} \]

This means Billy works on \(50 - 10 = 40\) days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day, so he helps:
\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Therefore, over 40 days, he helps:
\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the total number of people that the buses could carry:
   - There are 12 buses, and each bus carries 35 people.
   - Therefore, the total number of people that the buses could carry is \(12 \times 35\).

2. Calculate the total number of people that the cars could carry:
   - There are 20 cars, and each car carries 3 people.
   - Therefore, the total number of people that the cars could carry is \(20 \times 3\).

3. Add the number of people that the buses and cars could carry to find the total number of people inside the church:
   - The total number of people inside the church is \(12 \times 35 + 20 \times 3\).

Now, let's perform the calculations:

1. Calculate \(12 \times 35\):
   \[
   12 \times 35 = 12 \times (30 + 5) = (12 \times 30) + (12 \times 5) = 360 + 60 = 420
   \]

2. Calculate \(20 \times 3\):
   \[
   20 \times 3 = 60
   \]

3. Add the two results together:
   \[
   420 + 60 = 480
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is \(\boxed{480}\)."
"To determine Jeff's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. Therefore, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, we can calculate Jeff's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, Jeff is \(\boxed{30}\) years old."
"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the second biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{second biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second biggest}}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."

"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Ahito ran is \(\boxed{16}\)."

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{J}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:

"To find the total school population, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total school population by \( P \).

We can set up the equation based on the given information:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600. Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can now calculate the number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

Anna had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount spent on the 2 books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first calculate the 20% increase in the number of students from last year.

1. Calculate 20% of 50 students:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

2. Add this increase to the original number of students:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times.

Let's denote the time it takes for 459 blinks as \( x \) minutes. The proportion can be set up as follows:

\[
\frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{x \text{ minutes}}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply and then solve the resulting equation:

\[
255x = 459 \times 5
\]

\[
255x = 2295
\]

Now, divide both sides by 255 to isolate \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{2295}{255}
\]

\[
x = 9
\]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the initial number of each type of fish:

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Next, we add the new fish Tate buys:

- Male guppies: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Female guppies: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
- Male goldfishes: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- Female goldfishes: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

Now, we calculate the total number of male and female fishes:

- Total male fishes: \(6\) (male guppies) + \(5\) (male goldfishes) = \(11\)
- Total female fishes: \(8\) (female guppies) + \(8\) (female goldfishes) = \(16\)

Finally, we find the difference between the number of female and male fishes:

\[16 - 11 = 5\]

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's determine the time each person spent on their chores.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan's chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior's chore took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours + 1 hour (since it's ""well over 4 hours longer"") = 9 hours.

Now, we sum up the time each person spent on their chores:
- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 9 hours = 19 hours.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance to his parents' house:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles (one way).

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip distance = 2 × One way distance
   - Round trip distance = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles.

3. **Calculate the total distance for two visits a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance per month = 2 × Round trip distance
   - Total distance per month = 2 × 280 miles = 560 miles.

Therefore, the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is **560 miles**."
"First, let's determine how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will walk in 7 days as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let \( B \) represent the number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2 \times B \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk \(\boxed{35}\) miles in 7 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The first two workers each produce 6 toys per hour. Therefore, the total production for these two workers is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120 \text{ toys} \]

The next two workers each produce 4 toys per hour. Therefore, the total production for these two workers is:
\[ 2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Adding these together, the total production by the first four workers is:
\[ 120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys. This means that the total number of toys produced by all five workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Thus, the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:
\[
\boxed{105}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we will work backwards from the information given.

1. **Rob received 7 stickers from Kris.** Before giving these 7 stickers to Rob, Kris had \(7 + 9 = 16\) stickers (since Kris kept 9 for herself).

2. **Kris received 16 stickers from Luis.** Since Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.

3. **Luis received 32 stickers from Seth.** Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Thus, Seth had \(\boxed{64}\) stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total number of ounces of M&Ms John has:

\[ 3 \text{ large bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per large bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we determine the total number of M&Ms in those 30 ounces, knowing that each ounce contains 30 M&Ms:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, we need to find out how many small bags he can fill if each small bag contains 10 M&Ms:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance for half the circumference of the earth:**
   The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of the circumference is:
   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days required for Alfie to fly this distance:**
   Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**
   - The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
   - The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine the speed of the fastest car:**
   - The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is \(\boxed{750}\) miles per hour."
"To determine Vince's current age, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

1. Let \( V \) be Vince's current age.
2. Liam's current age is 16 years.
3. Two years ago, Liam's age was \( 16 - 2 = 14 \) years.
4. Two years ago, Vince's age was \( V - 2 \) years.

According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 14 = 2(V - 2) \]

Next, we solve for \( V \):
\[ 14 = 2(V - 2) \]
\[ 14 = 2V - 4 \]
\[ 14 + 4 = 2V \]
\[ 18 = 2V \]
\[ V = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ V = 9 \]

So, Vince is currently \(\boxed{9}\) years old."
"Let's define the variables for the number of eggs each person painted:
- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).
4. The total number of eggs painted is 56: \( A + M + C + S = 56 \).

Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \) in the total equation:
\[ A + A + C + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + C + S = 56 \]

We also know from the second and third pieces of information that:
\[ C + S = 30 \]
\[ C = S + 12 \]

We can substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we substitute \( C = 21 \) and \( S = 9 \) into the total equation:
\[ 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Since \( A = M \), we have \( M = 13 \).

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is:
\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the boxes is:
\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 1 pound = 16 ounces:
\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the length of the usable part of the tree:**
   - The tree is 80 feet tall.

"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's earnings} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Valerie's mother earns. Her mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary of Valerie and her brother} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Now, we calculate the mother's earnings:

\[ \text{Mother's earnings} = 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

Finally, we add up the earnings of Valerie, her brother, and her mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is:

"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and solve for the time spent on each segment of the walk.

1. **Determine the walking speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.
   - The distance walked on the beach is 2 miles.
   - Let \( v \) be the speed on the beach in miles per minute.
   - The time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
   - Therefore,
     \[
     40 = \frac{2}{v}
     \]
   - Solving for \( v \):
     \[
     v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

2. **Determine the walking speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
   - Therefore, the speed on the sidewalk is:
     \[
     2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk:**
   - The distance walked on the sidewalk is 1 mile.
   - Using the speed on the sidewalk:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time spent on the beach: 40 minutes
   - Time spent on the sidewalk: 10 minutes
   - Total time:

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She saves $4 every week and has been saving for 8 weeks.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more she needs to save to reach a total of $60.

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save the additional $28, given that she saves $4 each week.

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane \(\boxed{7}\) more weeks to save a total of $60."

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Bob originally has:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides of the equation to solve for the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his original 36 marbles. We can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} - 10 = 36 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Original number of marbles} - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, he will have:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we need to ensure that after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into the water bottle, the resulting mixture is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into the water bottle, the resulting mixture will be a weighted average of the two temperatures. The total volume of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces + 1 ounce).

The formula for the weighted average temperature \( T_{\text{avg}} \) is:
\[
T_{\text{avg}} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We need this average temperature to be at least 40 degrees:
\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):
\[
4 \times 33 = 132
\]

Substitute this into the inequality:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 5:
\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Next, solve for \( T \) by subtracting 132 from both sides:
\[
T \geq 68
\]

Thus, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after pouring the specified amounts.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}
\]"

"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

\[ \text{Cost per pack} = \$10.00 \]
\[ \text{Number of packs} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Total cost without discount} = 10 \times 4 = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

\[ \text{Discount} = 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times 40 = \$4.00 \]
\[ \text{Total cost with discount} = \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total:

\[ \text{Bagels per pack} = 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of packs} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of bagels} = 9 \times 4 = 36 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:
\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]
So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make the mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's break this down further:
- ""3 less than 6 potatoes"" means \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes.
- ""1 less than 3 scoops"" means \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops.

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we divide 3 potatoes by 2 scoops:
\[ \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ potatoes per scoop} \]

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:
\[ 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \]

So, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

1. **Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:**
   Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:**
   Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for the next 30 days.
   \[
   5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:**
   \[
   90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Convert the total number of eggs into dozens:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs,
   \[
   \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

1. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects from one tree in one year.
2. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects from all trees in one year.
3. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects from all trees in a decade (10 years).

Step 1: Lemons from one tree in one year
Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree each year. Since he has 5 trees, the number of lemons from one tree in one year is 6.

Step 2: Lemons from all trees in one year
Since Tim has 5 trees, the total number of lemons collected from all trees in one year is:
\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Step 3: Lemons from all trees in a decade
A decade is 10 years, so the total number of lemons collected from all trees in a decade is:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially based on the given ratio and total number of passengers.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 9 = 14\).

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the total number of passengers by the total parts of the ratio:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6
\]

Next, we calculate the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[
54 - 20 = 34
\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers and bouquets Faraday sold per day.

1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Each sunflower costs $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{2} = 13
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{56}{8} = 7
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sunflowers in each bouquet:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers from bouquets sold per day:**
   - Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers and 7 bouquets are sold per day, the number of sunflowers from bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     7 \times 12 = 84
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the sunflowers sold individually and the sunflowers from bouquets:
     \[
     13 + 84 = 97
     \]

6. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is:
     \[
     97 \times 3 = 291
     \]

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is \(\boxed{291}\)."
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5, so:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many seashells each person collected and then find out how many seashells each person gets after dividing them equally.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( C \) be the number of seashells Carlos collected.
- Let \( J \) be the number of seashells Jim collected.
- Let \( K \) be the number of seashells Carrey collected.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, we can write:
   \[
   J = 27 \quad \text{and} \quad J = C + 5
   \]
   Substituting \( J = 27 \) into the equation \( J = C + 5 \), we get:
   \[
   27 = C + 5 \implies C = 27 - 5 = 22
   \]
   So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

2. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, we can write:
   \[
   C = 2K
   \]
   Substituting \( C = 22 \) into the equation \( C = 2K \), we get:
   \[
   22 = 2K \implies K = \frac{22}{2} = 11
   \]
   So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, we know the number of seashells each person collected:
- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

Next, we find the total number of seashells collected by adding these amounts together:
\[
27 + 22 + 11 = 60
\]

Finally, they divided the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person gets:
\[
\frac{60}{3} = 20
\]

So, each person gets \(\boxed{20}\) seashells."
"To determine how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to break down his consumption by days and then sum them up.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - Mason eats 4 carrots each day.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of the land for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - So, he sells 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining land for $30.
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ fruits}
   \]
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   7 \times 50 = 350 \text{ fruits}
   \]
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ fruits}
   \]

Next, we need to find out how many fruits the 8-year-old tree produces. According to the problem, an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits:
\[
1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ fruits}
\]

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
\]

Adding these values step by step:
\[
50 + 150 = 200
\]
\[

1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B \) as \( B = Y - 7 \). Substituting this into the first relationship gives \( R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28 \).

Now, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"Let's start by determining how much money Rissa and Ronnie initially received. Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her initial money, so we can write the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Since Ronnie also gave the same amount \( x \) to their little sister, Ronnie gave $3 to their little sister as well. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total amount of paint and the distribution among colors:**
   - The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.
   - The mural is divided into four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
   - The problem states that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
   - Half of the mural is yellow.

2. **Determine the amount of yellow paint:**
   - Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:
     \[
     \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
     \]

3. **Determine the amount of red, white, and purple paint:**
   - The remaining paint is used for red, white, and purple.
   - The total amount of paint for red, white, and purple is:
     \[
     12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints}
     \]
   - Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, each color uses:
     \[
     \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - The amount of red paint used is:
     \[
     \boxed{2}

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:
\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:
\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:
\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
   \[
   a_1 = 3
   \]

2. **Tuesday:**
   The number of puffs doubles from Monday.
   \[
   a_2 = 2 \times a_1 = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   The number of puffs doubles from Tuesday.
   \[
   a_3 = 2 \times a_2 = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

4. **Thursday:**
   The number of puffs doubles from Wednesday.
   \[
   a_4 = 2 \times a_3 = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

5. **Friday:**
   The number of puffs doubles from Thursday.
   \[
   a_5 = 2 \times a_4 = 2 \times 24 = 48
   \]

Next, we sum the number of puffs counted each day to find the total for the week:
\[
\text{Total} = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Adding these values step-by-step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is:
\[
\boxed{93}

"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

To find 20% of 100:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. We need to find out how many pods are in the box for $1. Since the box costs $12 and contains 120 pods, the cost per pod is:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

If you can run 1 pod per cycle, then for $1, you can run:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday = \( 5 - (5 \times 0.45) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day.
   - Daily usage = \( 20\% \) of the remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the number of days before the chalk is recycled:**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the remaining chalk to fall below 2 inches.

Let's denote the remaining chalk after \( n \) days as \( C_n \).

- Initial remaining chalk \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches.
- Daily usage is 20% of the remaining chalk, so the remaining chalk after each day is 80% of the previous day's remaining chalk.

The formula for the remaining chalk after \( n \) days is:
\[ C_n = 2.75 \times (0.8)^n \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( C_n < 2 \) inches.

Let's calculate the remaining chalk for each day until it falls below 2 inches:

- After 1 day: \( C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.8 = 2.2 \) inches.
- After 2 days: \( C_2 = 2.2 \times 0.8 = 1.76 \) inches.

Since \( C_2 = 1.76 \) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will need to recycle the chalk after 2 days.

Therefore, the teacher has \(\boxed{2}\) days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"First, let's determine the number of girls on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of boys on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys}
\]

Now, we find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:

\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students}
\]

The total number of students in the class is:

\[
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ students}
\]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:

\[
24 - 7 = 17 \text{ students}
\]

Thus, the number of students not on varsity is:

\[
\boxed{17}

"First, let's determine the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of teeth fixed by adding the number of teeth drilled and the number of teeth capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' 30 teeth this represents. We use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many gallons of milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount was sour.

Calculate the amount of sour milk:

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information that can be translated into equations.

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation. From the first equation, we have:
\[
W = 5C + 35
\]
Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]
To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
Simplify the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]
Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]
Solve for \( C \):
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently \(\boxed{20}\) years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135
\]
Now, check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \(20 + 25 = 45\) years old, and this should be a third of Wendy's current age:
\[
45 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135
\]
Since \( \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \), the solution is verified to be correct."
"First, we need to determine how much money Bob spends on books per school. Since Bob spends a total of $27000 and this amount is distributed equally among 3 schools, we divide $27000 by 3:

\[
\frac{27000}{3} = 9000
\]

So, Bob spends $9000 on books for each school.

Next, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy with $9000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $9000, we divide $9000 by $500:

\[
\frac{9000}{500} = 18
\]

Since each set of $500 buys 100 books, buying 18 sets means he can buy:

\[
18 \times 100 = 1800
\]

Therefore, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's 6 friends will eat.

Each friend eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

For 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten will be:
- Cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, so the number of cheese pizzas needed is:
\[
\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas}
\]

Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:
\[

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's calculate the net rate of snowball production. Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many snowballs melt in an hour. There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, so the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is:
\[ 2 \text{ snowballs/15 minutes} \times 4 = 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

Therefore, the net rate of snowball production is:
\[ 20 \text{ snowballs/hour} - 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We do this by dividing the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of snowball production:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay \(\boxed{5}\) hours to have 60 snowballs."

"First, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings from her hourly rate.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. Therefore, her weekly hours are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her weekly earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times 1.5 \, \text{\$/hour} = 67.5 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April and Jen did not incur any absences, she will receive the additional $10 for each week. Therefore, her total additional earnings for the month are:
\[ 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 10 \, \text{\$/week} = 40 \, \text{\$} \]

Now, we add her weekly earnings from her hourly rate to her additional earnings for the month:
\[ 67.5 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} + 40 \, \text{\$} = 270 \, \text{\$} + 40 \, \text{\$} = 310 \, \text{\$} \]

   - He did this 6 times.
   - Total earnings from emptying the dishwasher: \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

2. **Doing his laundry:**
   - Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry.
   - He did this once.
   - Total earnings from doing his laundry: \( 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00 \) dollars.

3. **Cleaning his room:**
   - Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room.
   - He did this once.
   - Total earnings from cleaning his room: \( 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50 \) dollars.

4. **Taking the trash to the curb:**
   - Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb each week.
   - He did this twice.
   - Total earnings from taking the trash: \( 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50 \) dollars.

Now, we sum all the earnings:
\[
3.00 \text{ (dishwasher)} + 3.00 \text{ (laundry)} + 1.50 \text{ (cleaning room)} + 1.50 \text{ (trash)} = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Jason earned is \(\boxed{9.00}\)."
"First, we need to determine the amount of blood a single shark has. According to the information provided, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood a shark has as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have in total. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, we multiply the amount of blood one shark has by 10:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of blood that ten sharks have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Morning Entry:**
   - 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.

2. **10:00 Entry:**
   - 40 more people entered the restaurant at 10:00.

3. **Afternoon Entry:**
   - Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is:
     \[
     2 \times 40 = 80
     \]

4. **Evening Entry:**
   - An additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (morning entry) had entered the restaurant by evening. Since 50 people entered in the morning, 3 times that number is:
     \[
     3 \times 50 = 150
     \]

5. **Total Number of People:**
   - Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant throughout the day:
     \[
     50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (afternoon)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
     \]

Thus, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is:
\[
\boxed{320}
\]"
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red pens.
2. Calculate the number of black pens.
3. Add the number of red pens and black pens together.

First, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we know that the number of black pens is twice the number of red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens together to find the total number of pens:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Thus, the total number of pens Alain has is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[
\text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch per bottle. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2400}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day Planting:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. This means he planted \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Total White Oak trees planted over the two days: \(20 + 30 = 50\).
   - Total Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days: \(40 + 50 = 90\).
   - Therefore, the total number of trees planted is \(50 + 90 = 140\).

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."

1. **Initial Amount of Root Beer:**
   Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.
   \[
   \text{Initial amount} = 24 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **After Children Drank:**
   Fred's children drank 4 gallons.
   \[
   \text{Amount after children} = 24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After Wife Spilled:**
   Fred's wife spilled 7 gallons.
   \[
   \text{Amount after wife} = 20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After Friend Helped Himself:**
   Fred's friend Ronnie took 5 gallons.
   \[
   \text{Amount after friend} = 13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Amount Available for the Party:**
   On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is to be shared equally among them.
   \[
   \text{Amount per person} = \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{3} = \frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons}
   \]

So, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{8}{3}}

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes, and then add these two quantities together.

1. **Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:**
   - There are 66 fish in total.
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   \[
   \text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining fish:**
   - Subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.
   \[
   \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes:**
   - Five-elevenths of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   \[
   \text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:**
   - Add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.
   \[
   \text{Total number of fish with red and blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had:**
   - Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each.
     \[
     2 \text{ palettes} \times 4 \text{ colors per palette} = 8 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Amy also had three makeup sets with six colors each.
     \[
     3 \text{ sets} \times 6 \text{ colors per set} = 18 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Adding these together gives the total number of colors Amy originally had.
     \[
     8 \text{ colors} + 18 \text{ colors} = 26 \text{ colors}
     \]

2. **Account for the palette stolen by her sister:**
   - One palette with four colors is stolen.
     \[
     26 \text{ colors} - 4 \text{ colors} = 22 \text{ colors}
     \]

3. **Account for the colors used from one makeup set:**
   - Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which originally had six colors.
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ colors}}{2} = 3 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Subtract these used colors from the remaining total.

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's two-story house. Since his house is 7 times as high as he is, and Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the house is:

\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor to the ceiling. This height is thrice as high as Mattison is, so:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the height of the second floor to the roof. The total height of the house is 420 inches, and the height of the first floor to the ceiling is 180 inches. Therefore, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's determine how many shells team Alphas found. Since team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

So, team Alphas found 280 shells. This leaves:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

shells for the other two teams to find.

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. This leaves:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

shells for team Gogetters.

Therefore, team Gogetters found:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's denote the miles the last dog needs to walk as \( x \).

The total miles walked by all four dogs per day is the sum of the miles each dog needs to walk:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x \]

We know that the average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles. The formula for the average is the total miles divided by the number of dogs. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{1 + 4 + 3 + x}{4} = 3 \]

To find \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to clear the denominator:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12 \]

Next, we simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ x = 4 \]

So, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets, which is 40% of the value of his house.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of this loan amount John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts by subtracting the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John has leftover after paying his debt is \(\boxed{40000}\)."
"First, we need to find the total weight of the tunas Deandre caught. He caught three tunas with the following weights:
- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
- The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

To find the total weight, we add these weights together:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 \]

Adding these step by step:
\[ 56 + 46 = 102 \]
\[ 102 + 26 = 128 \]

So, the total weight of the tunas is 128 kilograms.

Next, we need to calculate how much Deandre will earn by selling these tunas. The price per kilogram of tuna is $0.50. Therefore, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[ 128 \times 0.50 \]

Performing the multiplication:
\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Thus, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \(\frac{11}{8}\) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines at $72. Therefore, the selling price is:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8}
\]

To perform the multiplication, we can simplify it as follows:
\[
72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99
\]
So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

Thus, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting.
   - Total water removed on the low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the medium setting.
   - Total water removed on the medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 5 days on the high setting.
   - Total water removed on the high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Finally, we sum the water removed at each setting to find the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement:

\[
3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons left} = 288 \text{ balloons thrown} \]

Thus, the number of balloons thrown is:

\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of the second medicine needed for one dose.
2. Calculate the total amount of medicine for one dose.
3. Multiply the total amount of medicine for one dose by 8 to find the total amount for 8 doses.

First, we know that for one dose, Saanvi needs 14 mL of the first medicine and 3 times that amount of the second medicine. So, the amount of the second medicine is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ mL} \]

Next, we add the amounts of the two medicines to find the total amount of medicine for one dose:
\[ 14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} = 56 \text{ mL} \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of medicine for 8 doses. We do this by multiplying the total amount of medicine for one dose by 8:
\[ 56 \text{ mL} \times 8 = 448 \text{ mL} \]

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:
\[ \boxed{448} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each class at Ali's school and John's school.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Each of John's classes has a capacity of \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class capacity. Therefore, the capacity of one of John's classes is:
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the capacities of both schools to find the combined capacity:
\[ 120 + 30 = 150 \]

The combined capacity of both schools is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen owes his sister, including the 2% interest on the $300 borrowed.

The interest amount is:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen owes is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 each month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the total amount he owes minus the amount he has already paid:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. Therefore, the number of diaper changes she handles is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Since the total number of changes per day is 10 and Jordan's wife handles 5 of them, the number of diaper changes Jordan handles is:

\[ 10 \text{ changes} - 5 \text{ changes} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

So, Jordan changes:

\[ \boxed{5} \text{ diapers per day} \]"
"First, let's calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is given by:

\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the effective volume that can be occupied by the jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency. The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:

\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. Therefore, the maximum number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is:

\[ \text{Maximum number of jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. So, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 0.30 \times 2880 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. The difference between the true number and Tim's estimate is:

\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was off by:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people on the bus:**
   \[
   \text{Initial number of people} = 20
   \]

2. **Number of people entering the bus at the first stop:**
   \[
   \text{People entering at the first stop} = 40
   \]

3. **Total number of people on the bus after the first stop:**
   \[
   \text{Total after first stop} = 20 + 40 = 60
   \]

4. **Number of people entering the bus at the second stop:**
   \[
   \text{People entering at the second stop} = \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]

5. **Total number of people on the bus after the second stop:**
   \[
   \text{Total after second stop} = 60 + 30 = 90
   \]

6. **Number of people entering the bus at the third stop:**
   \[
   \text{People entering at the third stop} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

7. **Total number of people on the bus after the third stop:**
   \[
   \text{Total after third stop} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

8. **Bus capacity:**
   \[
   \text{Bus capacity} = 200
   \]

9. **Number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining spaces} = 200 - 270 = -70
   \]

Since the number of people on the bus (270) exceeds the bus capacity (200), it is not possible to fill the remaining spaces on the bus. Therefore, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:

\[
\boxed{0}

"First, let's determine the initial cost of one visit to the museum, which is $2.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. An increase of 150% means the new cost is the original cost plus 150% of the original cost. Mathematically, this can be calculated as:
\[ \text{New cost} = 2 + 2 \times 1.5 = 2 + 3 = 5 \]

So, the new cost of one visit after 5 years is $5.

Pauline visits the museum three times a year. Therefore, the cost for one year after the increase is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

For 5 years, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \]

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased to $5, and Pauline continues to visit the museum three times a year for 3 more years. The cost for one year for the next 3 years is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

So, the total cost for the next 3 years is:
\[ 15 \times 3 = 45 \]

Adding the cost of the first 5 years and the next 3 years, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
\[ 75 + 45 = 120 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room:**
   - There are 10 students in each grade with the most points.
   - There are 3 grades (4th, 5th, and 7th).
   - Therefore, the total number of students is \(10 \times 3 = 30\).

2. **Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed:**
   - Since 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we divide the total number of students by 8.
   - \(30 \div 8 = 3.75\).

3. **Calculate the number of full groups and the remaining students:**
   - We can form 3 full groups of 8 students.
   - The remaining students are \(30 - (3 \times 8) = 30 - 24 = 6\).

4. **Determine the time required for the remaining students:**
   - Since 6 students are less than 8, they will form a partial group.
   - The time required for the partial group is the same as the full group, which is 45 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time required:**
   - Each full group takes 45 minutes.
   - There are 3 full groups, so \(3 \times 45 = 135\) minutes.
   - The partial group also takes 45 minutes.

6. **Add the time for the full groups and the partial group:**
   - Total time = \(135 + 45 = 180\) minutes.

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{180}\) minutes for everyone to try the escape room."

- John made 4 wooden tables at $20 each.
- The total cost for the tables is \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for the roof frames:
- John made 2 roof frames at $10 each.
- The total cost for the roof frames is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs together to find out how much Ali has to pay John:
- The total amount is \( 80 + 20 = 100 \) dollars.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John \(\boxed{100}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."
"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning is needed to make 80 meatballs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of ground beef needed for 80 meatballs:**
   - Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - To find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed for 80 meatballs, we divide 80 by 16:
     \[
     \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of secret seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - For 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of secret seasoning needed is:
     \[
     5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
     \]

Therefore, Aiden will need \(\boxed{10}\) tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."

"To determine how many inches of rain will fall on Tuesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the amount of rain on Monday.
2. Calculate the expected amount of rain on Tuesday based on the given condition.

First, we know that it rained 2 inches on Monday.

Next, we need to find out how much rain is expected on Tuesday. The problem states that the expected rain on Tuesday is 1 more inch than twice the amount of rain on Monday. We can express this mathematically as:
\[ \text{Rain on Tuesday} = 2 \times (\text{Rain on Monday}) + 1 \]

Substituting the amount of rain on Monday (2 inches) into the equation, we get:
\[ \text{Rain on Tuesday} = 2 \times 2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Therefore, the amount of rain expected on Tuesday is \(\boxed{5}\) inches."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes.
- Let \( b \) be the number of brownies.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]
2. Each of the 5 people in the class gets 2 treats, so the total number of treats is:
   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10
   \]
   This means the total number of cupcakes and brownies is 10. So we can write:
   \[
   c + b = 10
   \]

Now we substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]
Simplify the left side:
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]
Add 2 to both sides:
\[
4c = 12
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[
c = 3
\]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."

   - Discounted price: \( 35 - 7 = 28 \)

2. **Pedicure Cost:**
   - Original price: $40
   - Discount: 20%
   - Discount amount: \( 40 \times \frac{20}{100} = 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \)
   - Discounted price: \( 40 - 8 = 32 \)

3. **Total Cost for Manicure and Pedicure:**
   - Combined cost: \( 28 + 32 = 60 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of the nail art.

\]

Therefore, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is:
\[
\boxed{42}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of paintings each person has using variables and then set up equations based on the information given.

1. Let \( S \) represent the number of paintings Samantha has.
2. Let \( Sh \) represent the number of paintings Shelley has.
3. Let \( K \) represent the number of paintings Kim has.

From the problem, we know:
- Samantha has 27 paintings, so \( S = 27 \).
- Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so \( S = Sh - 12 \).
- Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so \( Sh = K + 8 \).

First, substitute the value of \( S \) into the equation \( S = Sh - 12 \):
\[ 27 = Sh - 12 \]
To find \( Sh \), add 12 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 27 + 12 = Sh \]
\[ Sh = 39 \]

Now, use the value of \( Sh \) in the equation \( Sh = K + 8 \):
\[ 39 = K + 8 \]
To find \( K \), subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 39 - 8 = K \]
\[ K = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has \(\boxed{31}\) paintings."
"First, let's calculate the price of the toy after an 80% increase in December.

The original price in November is $40. An 80% increase means the price is increased by 80% of $40.

\[ \text{Increase} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the new price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. A 50% decrease means the price is reduced by 50% of $72.

\[ \text{Decrease} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]

So, the price after the decrease in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"First, let's calculate the standard rate and the reduced rate for the veteran lessons.

Charlie's standard rate is $80 per hour.

For veteran lessons, he reduces his rate by 25%. To find the reduced rate, we calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from the standard rate:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]
\[ \text{Reduced rate} = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from the 4 standard rate lessons:
\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times 80 \text{ dollars/lesson} = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total earnings from the 2 veteran lessons:
\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times 60 \text{ dollars/lesson} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
\[ 320 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:
\[ \boxed{440} \]"
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Sum all the scores**: Add up all the scores Sally received.
2. **Count the number of scores**: Determine how many quizzes Sally took.
3. **Calculate the mean**: Divide the total sum of the scores by the number of quizzes.

Let's start with the first step:

The scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

Sum of the scores:
\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630 \]

Next, we count the number of scores. Sally took 9 quizzes.

Now, we calculate the mean:
\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of the scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} = \frac{630}{9} = 70 \]

So, Sally's mean score is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine how many pomelos Eve gave away, we start by figuring out how many pomelos she has left after giving some away. Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos and is left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of her original amount. Therefore, the number of pomelos she has left is:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

This means Eve has 5 pomelos left. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number of pomelos:

\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Thus, the number of pomelos Eve gave away is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]
So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some is:
\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]
Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. First, we calculate 25% of 36:
\[
25\% \times 36 = \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]
So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:
\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]
Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:
\[
27 \times 3 = 81
\]
Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{81}

"To determine the number of novels Regina has written this year, we start by letting \( x \) represent the number of novels she has written this year. According to the problem, the 9 novels she wrote last year are 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she has written this year. This relationship can be expressed with the equation:

\[
9 = \frac{3}{4}x
\]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[
9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication on the left side:

\[
9 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{9 \times 4}{3} = \frac{36}{3} = 12
\]

Thus, the number of novels Regina has written this year is:

\[
x = 12
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days:**
   - Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr.
   - He travels for 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding stops), the total travel time is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) hours.
   - The total distance covered in 72 hours is \(50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hr} = 3600 \text{ km}\).

2. **Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered:**
   - The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km.
   - The percentage of the distance covered is calculated by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance Covered}}{\text{Total Distance}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\%
     \]

Therefore, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is \(\boxed{60\%}\)."
"To determine the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to follow these steps:

"To determine how many teachers were at Rydell Elementary School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of teachers at the school.
2. Subtract the number of teachers who were sick.
3. Add the number of substitute teachers called in.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. The total number of teachers at the school is 82.
2. The number of teachers who were sick is 13. So, we subtract 13 from 82:
   \[
   82 - 13 = 69
   \]
   This means that 69 teachers were not sick and were therefore at school.
3. The number of substitute teachers called in is 9. So, we add 9 to the 69 teachers who were not sick:
   \[
   69 + 9 = 78
   \]

Therefore, the number of teachers at school that day is \(\boxed{78}\)."
"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of Pasta:**
   Bud uses one box of pasta per week. The cost of one box of pasta is $1.00.
   \[
   \text{Weekly cost of pasta} = \$1.00
   \]

2. **Cost of Cheddar Cheese:**
   Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese each week.
   \[
   \text{Weekly cost of cheddar cheese} = \$3.00
   \]

3. **Cost of Gruyere Cheese:**
   Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese. Therefore, the cost of gruyere cheese is:
   \[
   \text{Weekly cost of gruyere cheese} = 2 \times \$3.00 = \$6.00
   \]

4. **Total Weekly Cost:**
   Adding up the costs for all the ingredients, the total weekly cost is:
   \[
   \text{Total weekly cost} = \$1.00 + \$3.00 + \$6.00 = \$10.00
   \]

5. **Total Annual Cost:**
   Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total annual cost is the weekly cost multiplied by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
   \[
   \text{Total annual cost} = \$10.00 \times 52 = \$520.00
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.

Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean, so for 80 classrooms:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes the custodian has available each day to clean. Since they work an 8-hour day:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to clean all 80 classrooms:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes/day}} = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the task, they will be able to finish within the given time frame. Now, we need to calculate the average percentage of their day spent cleaning.

The total time spent cleaning per day is 480 minutes, and we need to find what percentage this is of an 8-hour day (480 minutes):
\[ \frac{480 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes}} \times 100\% = 100\% \]

However, since they only need 2.5 days to clean all the classrooms, we need to find the average percentage of their day spent cleaning over the 5 days. The total time spent cleaning over 5 days is:
\[ 2.5 \text{ days} \times 480 \text{ minutes/day} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

The average time spent cleaning per day is:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{5 \text{ days}} = 240 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we find what percentage 240 minutes is of an 8-hour day (480 minutes):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes}} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

So, the average percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

1. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. Since a bookcase has one top shelf, one bottom shelf, and two middle shelves, the total capacity is:
\[15 + 20 + 2 \times 10 = 15 + 20 + 20 = 55 \text{ books}\]

Next, we need to determine how many bookcases Elly needs to hold all 110 books. We do this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Therefore, Elly needs \(\boxed{2}\) bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Rose will sell each set of 3 eggs for $1. Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of red hats. Since half of the hats are red, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
\]

Next, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the red hats:

\[
\text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
\]

Out of these remaining hats, \(\frac{3}{5}\) are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:

\[
\text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:

\[
\text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one bag of beef jerky after the discount. The original price is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the price after the discount is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per stick of beef jerky. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag and the bag now costs $15.00, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass:**
   - Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions.
   - The total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests: \(70 + 40 = 110\).

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. To find the number of blueberry cubes, we substitute \( S = 20 \) into the expression for the number of blueberry cubes:
\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \(\boxed{96}\)."
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total number of games Ara has played in four years.
2. Multiply the total number of games by her average score per game.

First, we know that Ara plays 40 games every year. Over four years, the total number of games she has played is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, we know that Ara scores 21 points in each game. Therefore, the total number of points she has scored in 160 games is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate each part step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the family, so there are 4 flashlights for the people.
   - There are 8 rooms, and for each room, there are 2 flashlights. Therefore, the total number of flashlights for the rooms is \(8 \times 2 = 16\).
   - Adding the flashlights for the people and the rooms together, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

2. **Calculate the number of candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each. So, the number of rooms with small candles is \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\). Therefore, the total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
   - The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each. So, the number of rooms with medium candles is also \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\). Therefore, the total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
   - Adding the small and medium candles together, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

3. **Calculate the total number of candles and flashlights:**
   - The total number of candles and flashlights is the sum of the flashlights and the candles, which is \(20 + 36 = 56\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{56}

   - Each side takes half the time of the first side.
   - Time for each of these sides: \( \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \) minutes
   - Total time for the fourth and fifth sides: \( 2.5 + 2.5 = 5 \) minutes

4. **Sixth side:**
   - Once the fifth side is solved, the sixth side is solved immediately.
   - Time for the sixth side: 0 minutes (since it's solved instantly after the fifth side)

Now, we sum the times for all sides:
\[
5 \text{ (first side)} + 20 \text{ (second and third sides)} + 5 \text{ (fourth and fifth sides)} + 0 \text{ (sixth side)} = 30 \text{ minutes}

"To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

1. Let the number of blue blocks be \( B \).
2. Let the number of yellow blocks be \( Y \).
3. Let the number of red blocks be \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
- The number of blue blocks \( B \) is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks \( Y \) is twice the number of blue blocks, so \( Y = 2 \times B = 2 \times 4 = 8 \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. Therefore, the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes net reduction/day} \]

We need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at this net rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

The total number of cookies made is 7995. The number of rainbow cookies is 2595, and the number of oatmeal cookies is 3075.

First, we add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
\[ 2595 + 3075 = 5670 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies to find the number of chocolate chip cookies:
\[ 7995 - 5670 = 2325 \]

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is:
\[ \boxed{2325} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each item:
- Let \( t \) be the number of test tubes Igor actually gathered.
- Let \( b \) be the number of beakers Igor actually gathered.
- Let \( p \) be the number of Petri dishes Igor actually gathered.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so \( t = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \).
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, so \( p = 14 + 2 = 16 \).
3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so \( b \) is the number of beakers actually gathered.
4. The total number of items on the lab bench is 29, so we have the equation:
   \[
   t + b + p = 29
   \]
   Substituting the values of \( t \) and \( p \) into the equation, we get:
   \[
   8 + b + 16 = 29
   \]
   Simplifying this, we find:
   \[
   24 + b = 29
   \]
   Solving for \( b \), we get:
   \[
   b = 29 - 24 = 5
   \]
   Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers lost is:
   \[
   7 - b = 7 - 5 = 2
   \]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for all the table legs.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed per table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James starts with 40 screws. After using 32 screws, the number of screws left over is:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Therefore, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the number of eggs in each basket.

1. The first basket contains 10 eggs.
2. The second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket. Therefore, the number of eggs in the second basket is:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20
   \]

Next, we add the number of eggs in both baskets together:
\[
10 + 20 = 30
\]

Thus, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

1. Alexandra raises $430.
2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises \(430 + 320 = 750\) dollars.
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises \(300 + 400 = 700\) dollars.

Now, we add up the amounts raised by each person to find the total:

\[
430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180
\]

So, the total amount of money they all raised is \(\boxed{2180}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds and distances run by Aaron and Vanessa, and then use the given information to find the time it took for Vanessa to complete her part of the race.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of Vanessa in miles per minute.
   - Let \( a \) be the speed of Aaron in miles per minute.

2. **Establish the Speed Relationship:**
   - According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. Therefore, \( a = \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Establish the Distance Relationship:**
   - Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. If Aaron runs \( d \) miles, then Vanessa runs \( 2d \) miles. Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, we have \( 2d = 4 \). Solving for \( d \), we get \( d = 2 \) miles. So, Aaron ran 2 miles.

4. **Calculate Aaron's Speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes. Therefore, his speed \( a \) is:
     \[
     a = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

5. **Calculate Vanessa's Speed:**
   - Using the relationship \( a = \frac{v}{2} \), we substitute \( a = \frac{1}{8} \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} = \frac{v}{2} \implies v = \frac{1}{8} \times 2 = \frac{1}{4} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

6. **Calculate the Time Vanessa Took:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles at a speed of \( \frac{1}{4} \) miles per minute. The time \( t \) it took her is:
     \[
     t = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, Vanessa took \(\boxed{16}\) minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of line needed:**
   - The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
   - There are 200 feet of dock.
   - Therefore, the total amount of line needed is:
     \[
     3 \text{ feet/foot of dock} \times 200 \text{ feet of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line}
     \]

2. **Subtract the amount of line already available:**
   - The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line.
   - Therefore, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
     \[
     600 \text{ feet} - 6 \text{ feet} = 594 \text{ feet}
     \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{594}

"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of meals and wine per night:**
   - They order 2 meals each night.
   - Each meal costs $5.
   - They also order a $5 bottle of wine.
   - Therefore, the total cost per night is:
     \[
     2 \text{ meals} \times \$5 \text{ per meal} + \$5 \text{ for wine} = \$10 + \$5 = \$15
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for the number of nights the restaurant is open:**
   - The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the week is:
     \[
     \$15 \text{ per night} \times 2 \text{ nights} = \$30
     \]

Thus, the total amount the restaurant makes in a week is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"First, we need to determine the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

Next, we need to calculate the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. The profit percentage is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 2.00 \]

So, the selling price per watermelon is \(\boxed{2.00}\)."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. We know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. Therefore, her current age is:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \]

Next, we know that James is currently twice as old as Dora. Since Dora is 9 years old, James's current age is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how old John's youngest son is. The problem states that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. To find out how old the youngest son is now, we need to know John's current age. We know that John had James when he was 19, and James is currently 18. Therefore, John's current age is:
\[ 19 + 18 = 37 \]

Since John's youngest son was born when John was 32, the youngest son's current age is:
\[ 37 - 32 = 5 \]

Finally, we need to determine how old the youngest son will be in 3 years:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
\[
20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
\]

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled \(\boxed{5}\) more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and he gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( k \) as the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to find out how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
