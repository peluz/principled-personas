"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs she uses is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the amount she makes from selling the eggs is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

"To calculate Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. A 150% increase on $80,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the repairs and the purchase price:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, and each sprint is 60 meters.

To find the total distance he runs in a week, we can calculate it as follows:

1. Distance per sprint: 60 meters
2. Number of sprints per week: 3 sprints/day * 3 days/week = 9 sprints/week
3. Total distance per week: 60 meters/sprint * 9 sprints/week = 540 meters/week

So, James runs a total of 540 meters a week."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken eats in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily feed requirement to find the final meal amount.

Step 1: Each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day.

Step 2: Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total for these two meals is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Step 3: The total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Now, subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily requirement to find the final meal amount:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can break this down into 8 pairs of glasses, where each pair consists of one glass at $5 and one glass at $3.

For each pair:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.

So, the cost for each pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost is:
8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
Charleston = 4 * Seattle
Charleston = 4 * 20
Charleston = 80

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
Toulouse = 2 * Charleston
Toulouse = 2 * 80
Toulouse = 160

Now, we add up the sheep from all three cities:
Total sheep = Seattle + Charleston + Toulouse
Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160
Total sheep = 260

Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 260 sheep together."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
2. Add the time for the Windows update installation.
3. Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file.
4. Sum up all the times to get the total download time.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Time for the Windows update installation:**
   - This is given as 20 minutes.

3. **Time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

4. **Total download time:**
   - Sum of the times from each step: \( 40 \) minutes (first 40%) + \( 20 \) minutes (Windows update) + \( 60 \) minutes (remaining 60%) = \( 120 \) minutes.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels to the point where he turns around.

John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.

Next, we need to calculate how far John travels back towards home in the 4 hours he spends trying to get home.

He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at a speed of 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drives for the remaining time of 4 hours - 2 hours (standstill) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours at a speed of 80 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance he covers in the 4 hours is:
\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he initially was 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."
"Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10. For the first 40 hours, she earns at this rate. For the additional 5 hours (overtime), she earns 1.2 times her regular rate.

Regular earnings for 40 hours:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Overtime earnings for 5 hours:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times (1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour}) = 5 \times \$12 = \$60 \]

Total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%, so the downloads were 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - 3 dozen at $68 per dozen
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 * $68 = $204

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - 2 dozen at $80 per dozen
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 * $80 = $160

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - 6 dozen at $55 per dozen
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 * $55 = $330

Now, we add up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Growth**: 7 lemons per year
3. **Selling Price per Lemon**: $1.5
4. **Annual Cost to Water and Feed**: $3

First, calculate the net profit per year:

- Revenue from selling lemons: \(7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}\)
- Cost to water and feed the tree: \$3/year
- Net profit per year: \(\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5\)

Next, we need to find the number of years (\(n\)) it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of planting the tree:

\[ \text{Net profit per year} \times n = \text{Initial cost} \]
\[ \$7.5 \times n = \$90 \]

Solving for \(n\):

\[ n = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**Final Answer: 12 years**"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after these sales. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

5. To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]

6. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]

7. Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]

8. Finally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

18"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after accounting for contemporary and jazz dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Therefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

2. **Electronic gadgets:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

Now, we compare the final values to determine the profit:

- Profit from jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the electronic gadgets, as the profit from electronic gadgets is higher.

**Final profit: $125** (if choosing jewelry) or **$96** (if choosing electronic gadgets). 

Since the question asks for the profit to be maximized, the final profit would be **$125** from the jewelry."
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her weekly earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs, and then multiply that by the number of weeks she works in a year.

1. Calculate her weekly earnings from teaching:
   - She gets paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week.
   - Weekly earnings from teaching = $20 * 35 = $700

2. Calculate her weekly earnings from coaching:
   - She gets paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week.
   - Weekly earnings from coaching = $30 * 15 = $450

3. Calculate her total weekly earnings:
   - Total weekly earnings = Weekly earnings from teaching + Weekly earnings from coaching
   - Total weekly earnings = $700 + $450 = $1150

4. Calculate her annual salary:
   - She works 50 weeks a year.
   - Annual salary = Total weekly earnings * Number of weeks worked in a year
   - Annual salary = $1150 * 50 = $57,500

Her annual salary is $57,500."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire eats 3 eggs every day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats:
3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week

Step 3: In 4 weeks, she eats:
21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs

Step 4: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert 84 eggs into dozens:
84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to cover the 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
2. Determine the time already spent on the first 6 miles.
3. Calculate the remaining time she has to cover the last 6 miles.
4. Find the required speed for the remaining distance.

Step 1: Calculate the total time required to cover 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Step 2: Determine the time already spent on the first 6 miles.
\[ \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Step 3: Calculate the remaining time she has to cover the last 6 miles.
\[ \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Step 4: Find the required speed for the remaining distance.
\[ \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately, then account for the spill, and finally sum the remaining water.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters ≈ 6.67 liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = 9 liters.

3. **Account for the spill:**
   - We spill 1 liter of the orange drink, which means we lose \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 1 liter of water (since the orange drink is two-thirds water).
   - Amount of water spilled = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 \) liter = \( \frac{2}{3} \) liters ≈ 0.67 liters.

4. **Calculate the remaining water in the orange drink:**
   - Remaining water in the orange drink = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters - \( \frac{2}{3} \) liters = \( \frac{18}{3} \) liters = 6 liters.

5. **Calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters:**
   - Total water = Water from the remaining orange drink + Water from the pineapple drink
   - Total water = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

The final numerical answer is:
15 liters"
"Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract 23 from Raymond's current age of 25.

25 - 23 = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."

"Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find the original price \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
3. 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
4. Let the number of boxes of pizza be \( x \). Each box costs $8.50, so the total cost for the pizza is \( 8.50x \).

The total cost is the sum of all these items, which equals $50. So we can write the equation:

\[ 12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 33 + 8.50x = 50 \]
\[ 8.50x = 50 - 33 \]
\[ 8.50x = 17 \]
\[ x = \frac{17}{8.50} \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final numerical answer is:

"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will need is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend:
\[ \$16.00 \]"
"Henry's total trip is 60 miles. He stopped after 20 miles, so he had 60 - 20 = 40 miles left to travel. His second stop was 15 miles before the end, which means he had 15 miles left to travel after his second stop. Therefore, the distance between his first and second stops is 40 - 15 = 25 miles.

The number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is 25 miles."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair of high heels costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

The problem states that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
104"
"Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. So, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

Dividing both sides by 18, we find:

\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x\) back into the expression for Allen's age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first one's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than that is 60.

The third friend guesses 25% more than the first one's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

To find the average guess, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses:

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily care time for all dogs.
2. Multiply the daily care time by the number of days in a week.

Step 1: Daily care time for all dogs
- Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.
- John has 10 dogs.
- So, the total daily care time is \(10 \times 0.5 = 5\) hours.

Step 2: Weekly care time
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, the total weekly care time is \(5 \times 7 = 35\) hours.

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"If Raymond has 40 jewels, then half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Total points scored: 9

"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he earns:

13 lego sets * $15/lego set = $195

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends:

8 video games * $20/video game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left, which means the total amount he spent on video games is:

$195 (total earnings) - $5 (leftover) = $190

Since he actually spent $160 on video games, the calculation for the leftover money is correct. Now, to find out how many lego sets he still has, we need to consider that he sold all his lego sets initially, so he doesn't have any left.

Final numerical answer:
0 lego sets"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance he runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the right-hand side:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
10 miles per hour"
"Given that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and that her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can determine her running speed as follows:

\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed:

\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6 \text{ miles per hour}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking over a period of 6 hours. Therefore, the time spent running is:

\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

And the time spent walking is:

\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she can travel while running and walking:

\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance she can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances traveled while running and walking:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"If Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone, then with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. 

So, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. Therefore, the distance outside of the dragon's reach where Polly can stand and still hit the dragon is:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pie pieces available initially is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is the difference between the initial number of pieces and the remaining pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content per gram of chips:**
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the 300g bag is \(5 \times 250 = 1250\) calories.
   - The calorie content per gram is \( \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \).

2. **Determine the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume is \(2000 - 1800 = 200\) calories.

3. **Calculate how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since each gram of chips contains approximately 4.17 calories, the number of grams you can eat is \( \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.17 \text{ calories/gram}} \approx 48 \text{ grams} \).

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of beeswax are needed to make 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Determine how many pounds of beeswax are needed to make 20 candles.
Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the supplies.
The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
The net profit is:
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

Total number of hours spent writing articles in the three days: 104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work: 220.
3. Add the number of Post-it notes remaining after all the usage: 23.

Let's do the math:

Initial Post-it notes: 80
Post-it notes used at work: 220
Post-it notes remaining: 23

So, the equation to find the number of Post-it notes in the package is:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = (80 + 23) - 220 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 103 - 220 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = -117 \]

It seems there's a mistake in the calculation because the number of Post-it notes can't be negative. Let's re-evaluate the steps:

1. Start with 80 Post-it notes.
2. Use 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. Add the remaining 23 Post-it notes.

So, the correct equation should be:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 220 + 23 - 80 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 243 - 80 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he bought:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}
\]"
"To find out how many 6-inch pieces Tracy obtained from a 4-foot long wire, we need to convert the length of the wire into inches and then divide by the length of each piece.

1 foot = 12 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece:

48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces

Tracy obtained 8 pieces."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor has 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

"Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can calculate the number of dozens produced per day as follows:

252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozen eggs per day

Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen. Therefore, his daily earnings from selling eggs are:

21 dozen eggs per day * $2 per dozen = $42 per day

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week

Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles.

1. **Outbound Trip:**
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
   - Distance: \(D = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}\)

2. **Return Trip:**
   - Speed: 6 miles per hour
   - Distance: 30 miles (same as the outbound trip)
   - Time: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours}\)

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. If 7.5 pounds of that weight is from the comic books, then the remaining weight that needs to be removed by the toys is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys Uriah needs to remove to account for the remaining 7.5 pounds is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final numerical answer is:

- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Truck tires: 0 tires × $60 per tire = $0
- Car tires: 12 tires × $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $0 + $480 = $480

**Difference in revenue:**
- Revenue on Thursday: $520
- Revenue on Friday: $480
- Difference: $520 - $480 = $40

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the maximum weight the bridge can carry.
2. Subtract the weight of the empty truck and driver from the bridge's weight limit to find out how much weight is available for the boxes.
3. Divide the available weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.
2. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
3. The available weight for the boxes is \(5000 - 3755 = 1245\) pounds.
4. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is \(1245 \div 15 = 83\).

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year.

1. For the first half of the year (6 months), the charge is $140 per month.
2. For the second half of the year (6 months), the charge is 10% less than $140 per month.

First, let's calculate the charge for the first half of the year:
\[ \text{Charge for the first half} = 6 \times 140 = 840 \]

Next, let's calculate the charge for the second half of the year. A 10% reduction in the monthly charge means the new charge is 90% of $140:
\[ \text{New monthly charge} = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \]
\[ \text{Charge for the second half} = 6 \times 126 = 756 \]

- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, the total number of students is \(33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}\).

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money she makes in a week:

- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, the total amount of money is \(495 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$7425.00\).

Therefore, Judy makes \(\$7425.00\) in one week."

"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total amount from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total amount from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie slice is sold for $3.

Total from brownies = 43 slices * $3/slice = $129

Next, let's calculate the total amount from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4.

Total from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92

Now, we add the totals from both items to find the overall amount raised:
Total amount raised = Total from brownies + Total from cheesecakes
Total amount raised = $129 + $92 = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for the 3-month period.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the final amount.
4. Divide the final amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The total cost of the cell phones before interest is:
   \[
   5 \text{ phones} \times \$150 \text{ per phone} = \$750
   \]

2. The interest rate is 2% per month. So, the total interest for 3 months is:
   \[
   \$750 \times 0.02 \text{ per month} \times 3 \text{ months} = \$45
   \]

3. The final amount Shiela will pay is the total cost plus the total interest:
   \[
   \$750 + \$45 = \$795
   \]

4. To find the monthly payment, we divide the final amount by 3:
   \[
   \frac{\$795}{3} = \$265
   \]

So, the amount Shiela will pay each month for 3 months is:
\[
\boxed{265}

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, let's add up the totals:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. Level 3: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. Bottom level (Level 4): \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Now, we can find the total square footage of the sandcastle by summing the square footage of all levels:

\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year, the first year will have 365 - 180 = 185 days remaining after the first 180 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy will consume:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy will consume:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

So, in the first year, the puppy will consume a total of:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year is:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the two different package options.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:

1. Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
2. Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:

1. Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
2. Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options to determine the savings:

1. Savings: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30% of $100.

30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

So, the discount amount is $30.

Subtract the discount from the original cost:

$100 - $30 = $70

The final cost of the grooming is $70."
"Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, so each girl got:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

So, the two girls together got:

3. He receives 23 more stickers for his birthday, so now he has \(31 + 23 = 54\) stickers.
4. He gives 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has \(54 - 9 = 45\) stickers.
5. He uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has \(45 - 28 = 17\) stickers.

Therefore, the final number of stickers Charlie has left is 17."
"Grace weighs 125 pounds.

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, so we calculate Alex's weight as follows:

4 times Grace's weight: \(4 \times 125 = 500\) pounds
Alex's weight: \(500 - 2 = 498\) pounds

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's and Alex's weights together:

\(125 + 498 = 623\) pounds

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."
"To find the total number of thorns, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses.
2. Calculate the total number of thorns based on the number of roses.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses.
Dan plants 3 rose bushes, and each rose bush has 25 roses.
So, the total number of roses is \(3 \times 25 = 75\).

Step 2: Calculate the total number of thorns.
Each rose has 8 thorns.
So, the total number of thorns is \(75 \times 8 = 600\).

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

According to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games, so we can write the equation:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

The team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The final numerical answer is:

"The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which means it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, which means it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of rings from each time it went off:

4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22 times.

The alarm rang 22 times in all."
"Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. The company increases the salary by 10% every year for those who've stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just clocked 5 years in the company, she will start receiving the increased salary from the next year, which is her 6th year of service.

First, let's calculate her salary after the first year of the increase:
\[ \text{New Salary} = 600 + (0.10 \times 600) = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

Now, her salary will be increased by 10% again after the second year:
\[ \text{New Salary} = 660 + (0.10 \times 660) = 660 + 66 = 726 \]

After the third year, her salary will be increased by 10% again:
\[ \text{New Salary} = 726 + (0.10 \times 726) = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \]

So, her annual salary after three more years of service (which is her 9th year of service) will be:
\[ \boxed{798.6} \]"
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the adults.
3. Add the amounts from steps 1 and 2 to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat.
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \).
- There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for the children is \( 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \).

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the adults.
- There are 20 adults, and each adult eats 10 lbs, so the total amount of potato salad for the adults is \( 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \).

Step 3: Add the amounts from steps 1 and 2 to get the total amount of potato salad needed.
- The total amount of potato salad needed is \( 25 \text{ lbs} + 200 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \).

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."

"Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. If Lee now runs it in 38 seconds, then before the improvement, Gerald would have run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald improved his speed by 10%. This means he can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 90% of the time it took him before the improvement.

To find the new time, we calculate 90% of 40 seconds:

\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \]

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:

Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout:

Fraction of girls in the girl scout = 2/3

Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 * (2/3) = 80

Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout:

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce. So, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. We do this by dividing the total volume of tomatoes needed by the volume of one can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the number of tomatoes Freda used is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit, so they didn't have to drive through the traffic jam at all.

The total number of cars originally on the motorway is 30. After the traffic jam, the number of cars that actually drove through the jam is \( x + 20 - 5 \) (since 5 cars didn't drive through the jam).

So, the equation representing the total number of cars that drove through the jam is:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 - 5 \]
\[ x + 15 = 25 \]
\[ x = 25 - 15 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, 10 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- Friday: 2 hours
- Total: 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the total hours watched from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday:

- Monday + Tuesday + Thursday + Friday = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 hours

Since the total hours watched is 7 hours, the hours watched on Wednesday would be:

- 7 hours (total) - 5 hours (Monday to Friday) = 2 hours

Each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, so the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday would be:

- 2 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 4 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 4 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).

We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we need to find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, we can set up a proportion to find out how many feet she rows in 64 seconds:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{20 \text{ feet} \times 64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

So, Julia rows 80 feet to reach the shore.

Next, we need to calculate how much water the boat takes on during this 80 feet. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, we can set up another proportion to find out how much water is taken on for 80 feet:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{y \text{ liters}}{80 \text{ feet}}
\]

Solving for \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{2 \text{ liters} \times 80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

So, the boat takes on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reaches the shore.

\[
\boxed{16}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). Therefore, we have \( 300 = 50D \).
4. To find \( D \), we solve the equation \( 300 = 50D \) by dividing both sides by 50: \( D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6.

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought:

- Sasha bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]

- Sasha bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]

So, the total cost of the lumber is:
\[
\$100 + \$80 = \$180
\]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

- Sasha sells the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Since the price has increased by 50%, the new price is:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15 \text{ per board}
  \]
  Therefore, the revenue from selling the ten boards is:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]

- Sasha sells the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards. The new price is:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24 \text{ per board}
  \]
  Therefore, the revenue from selling the five boards is:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]

So, the total revenue from selling the lumber is:
\[
\$150 + \$120 = \$270
\]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90
\]

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of:
\[
\boxed{90}

"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers with 5 vehicles in each, which totals:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles already at the port from the total:

30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. So, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000
   \]
3. Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. So, Lylah's salary four years ago was:
   \[
   \frac{40000}{1.30} = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
   \]
4. Lylah's salary also increased by 40% four years later. So, her new salary is:
   \[
   30769.23 \times (1 + 0.40) = 30769.23 \times 1.40 \approx 43076.92

"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. 

One-third of 60 is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) letters.

These 20 letters are added to the pile of already-stamped letters, which now totals 30 letters.

To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we subtract the 20 newly-stamped letters from the current total of 30 letters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (since her husband gave her 5 spoons).

After using 3 spoons, she had \( x + 5 - 3 \) spoons left, which is equal to 12.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. B = 2Q (twice as many babies as queens)
2. W = 2B (twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
3. The total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700

Using the first relationship, we can express B in terms of Q: B = 2Q.

Using the second relationship, we can express W in terms of B: W = 2B. Since B = 2Q, we can substitute to get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

Now we can substitute W and B in terms of Q into the total number of bees equation:
4Q + 2Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens (Q), we can find the number of baby bees (B) and worker bees (W):
B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200
W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

"First, let's identify the food and non-food items:

- Milk is a food item, so its cost is $2.
- Eggs are a food item, so its cost is $3.
- Light bulbs are non-food items, so its cost is $3.
- Cups are non-food items, so its cost is $3.
- Roach traps are non-food items, so its cost is $4.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the non-food items before tax:

$3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $10

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:

10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the non-food items:

$10 (non-food items) + $1 (tax) = $11

Now, let's add the cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items with tax:

$2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) + $11 (non-food items with tax) = $16

- Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

The difference in time between the winner (Steve) and the loser (Tim) is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

4 minutes"
"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to determine the total number of tires inflated and then multiply by the cost per tire.

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles mean \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles mean \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle means \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\).

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"Carl buys ten packs of cookies, with each pack containing six cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost for 60 cookies is:

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

If Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is:

$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

**Final Answer: $4.00**"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

1. Let the initial number of fries be \( x \).

2. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).

3. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

5. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( x - 30 \), which is \( \frac{x - 30}{3} \).

6. Ants carried off the final fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the remaining fries are \( \frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

Now, we can set up the equation and solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5
\]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[
x - 30 = 18
\]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[
x = 48
\]

So, the initial number of fries in the pack was \( 48 \).

\[
\boxed{48}
\]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

**Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
- 3 classes per day
- Each class is 1 hour long
- Total for these 3 days: \(3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ hours}\)

**Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
- 2 classes per day
- Each class is 2 hours long
- Total for these 2 days: \(2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ hours}\)

**Total weekly hours:**
- \(9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\)

**Total semester hours:**
- 17 hours/week \(\times\) 16 weeks = 272 hours

So, Kimo spends a total of 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we need to calculate the length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum them up.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Number of rolls: 300
   - Length of each roll: 4 inches
   - Total length of rolls: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Number of croissants: 120
   - Length of each croissant: 6 inches
   - Total length of croissants: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Number of baguettes: 60
   - Length of each baguette: 2 feet (which is 24 inches)
   - Total length of baguettes: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches

Now, we sum up the total lengths in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[3360 \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to first determine the monthly consumption of bananas by all the apes and then multiply that by 2.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is:
200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

For 2 months, the total number of bananas needed is:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is 200 yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so:

\[ 200 \text{ yards/run} \times 15 \text{ runs} = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards, and she does this 34 times, so:

\[ 80 \text{ yards/run} \times 34 \text{ runs} = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. Since Blake runs more, we subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance:

\[ 3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."
"To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the pens, notebooks, and bond paper he bought.

1. Cost of pens: 4 pens * $1.5 each = $6
2. Cost of notebooks: 2 notebooks * $4 each = $8
3. Cost of bond paper: $20

Now, we add up all these costs:

Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper
Total cost = $6 + $8 + $20
Total cost = $34

Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"Finn initially watches 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them come out from under a lily pad, and 2 of them hide under a rock. 

So, the number of tadpoles he can see now is the initial number minus the ones that hid plus the ones that came out:

11 (initial) - 2 (hid under a rock) + 6 (came out from under a lily pad) = 15 tadpoles.

Finn can now see 15 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth is:
17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth is:
(2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught:

Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish

Combined total: 19 + 13 = 32 fish

They were able to catch a total of 32 fish."
"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

1. The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.
2. The price increases by 20% every two months. So, the price after every two months can be calculated as the original price plus 20% of the original price.

Let's denote the original price as \( P_0 = 20 \) dollars.

After 2 months, the price \( P_2 \) will be:
\[ P_2 = P_0 + 0.20 \times P_0 = 20 + 0.20 \times 20 = 20 + 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

After 4 months, the price \( P_4 \) will be:
\[ P_4 = P_2 + 0.20 \times P_2 = 24 + 0.20 \times 24 = 24 + 4.80 = 28.80 \text{ dollars} \]

After 6 months, the price \( P_6 \) will be:
\[ P_6 = P_4 + 0.20 \times P_4 = 28.80 + 0.20 \times 28.80 = 28.80 + 5.76 = 34.56 \text{ dollars} \]

We can see a pattern here. The price after \( n \) two-month periods can be expressed as:
\[ P_{2n} = P_0 \times (1 + 0.20)^n \]

Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we can substitute \( n = 18 \) into the formula:
\[ P_{36} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the price after 36 months is:
\[ P_{36} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ \boxed{787.32} \]"
"Given:
- 5 red cars, each costing $4.
- 3 action figures, each costing $5.
- A doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the red cars:
5 red cars * $4 per red car = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the action figures:
3 action figures * $5 per action figure = $15

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs:
3 action figures * $5 per action figure = $15

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the toys:
$20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50

The total worth of all the toys is $50."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the income she would lose by doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the income lost by doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses 3 hours of freelance work.
   - She earns $35 per hour from freelance work.
   - Therefore, the income lost is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105\).

2. The accountant charges $90.

3. Compare the cost of the accountant to the income lost:
   - Income lost by doing taxes herself: $105
   - Cost of hiring an accountant: $90

4. Calculate the difference:
   - The difference is \( \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \).

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and then subtract that from her budget.

The cost of the computer is €1090.
The cost of the screen is €157.
The cost of the keyboard and mouse is €74.
The cost of the CD burner is €74.
The cost of the printer is €102.

First, we add up the costs of all the items:

\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 74 + 102 = 1497 \]

"To make 15 Spanish flans, Sandra needs 3 eggs per flan. So, the total number of eggs required is:

15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

45 eggs / 9 eggs/babysitting = 5 babysitting sessions

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B \]
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

Final answer: 16"

"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the total miles he walks on the weekend is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend gives:

\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week."
"The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so:
\[ \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
\[ \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

Each uniform costs a total of $150."

"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, it will take \( 60 \times 1.5 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, it will take \( 60 \times 5 \) seconds.

Now, let's convert the cutting time into minutes:
- \( 60 \times 5 \) seconds is equal to \( 300 \) seconds.
- Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, \( 300 \) seconds is equal to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) minutes.

Now, let's add the time for peeling and cutting:
- Time to peel: \( 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \) minutes.
- Time to cut: \( 5 \) minutes.
- Total time: \( 90 + 5 = 95 \) minutes.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.
2. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.

First, we need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of white carnations} = \frac{\text{Number of pink calla lilies}}{5} \]

Substituting the given number of pink calla lilies:

\[ \text{Number of white carnations} = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can calculate the number of red roses as follows:

\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times \text{Number of white carnations} \]

Substituting the number of white carnations:

\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's time is 222 seconds.
Difference = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then expressing that difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[ \frac{0.25}{0.25} \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rats are in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
3. There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.
4. A total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters).

First, we need to find out how many pieces of straw were used for the hamsters and the rabbits:

- For the hamsters: \(10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces}\)
- For the rabbits: \(20 \text{ pieces}\)

So, the total pieces of straw used for the hamsters and rabbits is \(50 + 20 = 70 \text{ pieces}\).

Since the total straw distributed is 160 pieces, the straw used for the rats is \(160 - 70 = 90 \text{ pieces}\).

Now, we know that each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, and there are 3 cages with equal numbers of rats. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \(x\). Therefore, the total number of rats is \(3x\), and the total straw used for the rats is \(3x \times 6 = 18x\).

We know that \(18x = 90\), so we can solve for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{90}{18} = 5\]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to apply the monthly interest rate of 2% to the initial amount of $100 for each of the 3 months.

Let's break it down month by month:

**Month 1:**
- Initial amount: $100
- Interest for the month: $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total amount after 1 month: $100 + $2 = $102

**Month 2:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $102
- Interest for the month: $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total amount after 2 months: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**Month 3:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $104.04
- Interest for the month: $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total amount after 3 months: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12."
"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost to buy each bag is $20, and the cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \]

The trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he collects peaches for a total of 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

"To find out how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
2. Divide the total weekly need by 7 to find the daily need.

Step 1: Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are 10 ducks.
Total weekly need = 3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Step 2: Divide the total weekly need by 7 to find the daily need.
Daily need = 35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net increase in trees per year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.

2. Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.

3. Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the total number of trees before any die is \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

4. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, 70% of the trees survive. The number of trees that survive is \(130 \times 0.70 = 91\) trees.

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left is 91."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Friday morning, there are 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard.
2. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \) flamingos. So, they took 6 pink flamingos and painted them white.
3. After painting, there are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) pink flamingos left in Sue's front yard.
4. Then, on Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
5. The 6 white flamingos are still in Sue's front yard.

Now, we need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

24"
"Violetta wants to buy 5 different colors of crayons, and each crayon costs $2. 

To find out the total cost, we multiply the number of crayons by the cost per crayon:
5 crayons * $2/crayon = $10

Violetta prepared $20 for the purchase. To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the total cost from the amount she prepared:
$20 - $10 = $10

So, Violetta will get $10 in change."
"A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, the cost of a pen is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants.
2. Subtract the distributed amount from the total amount of carrots available.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of carrots distributed.
Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants.
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 2: Subtract the distributed amount from the total amount of carrots available.
There are 200 pounds of carrots available.
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:

Number of children = 6277

There are 6277 children in the city of Soda."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40
- Cards after the third month: 200

Total cards = Initial cards + Cards after the first month + Cards after the second month + Cards after the third month
Total cards = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200
Total cards = 320

So, Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards now in total."
"Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, he earns:
5 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays him 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, he earns:
10 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese for sandwiches: \(7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate an omelet 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese for omelets: \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add up all the slices of cheese used:

"Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, which totals to:

22 + 10 = 32 pens

She then bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, which adds:

6 * 9 = 54 blue pens

Additionally, she bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, which adds:

2 * 6 = 12 red pens

Now, to find the total number of pens Janet has, we add all the pens together:

32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens

Final numerical answer:

"To get an average of 93 over six tests, Brinley needs to have a total of \(93 \times 6 = 558\) points across all six tests, because the average is the total sum of scores divided by the number of tests.

Brinley's current total from the first five tests is \(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438\).

To find out what she needs on the sixth test, we subtract her current total from the required total:

\(558 - 438 = 120\).

However, since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average, Brinley should aim to remove the lowest score from her first five tests before adding the sixth test score. The lowest score among her first five tests is 71.

So, if Brinley removes 71 from her total, her new total becomes \(438 - 71 = 367\).

To achieve an average of 93, she needs a total of 558 points. Therefore, the score she needs on the sixth test is:

\(558 - 367 = 191\).

Brinley needs to score 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93, assuming she removes her lowest score of 71."
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did is:
\[ 860 \text{ km} \]"
"Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 20g.

Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought after all three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups would be \(240\) cups (since one dozen is 12).
   - Let the cost of one cup be \(x\).
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(240x\).

3. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, we can write the equation as:
     \[
     240x = 36000 - 1200
     \]

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     240x = 34800
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 240 to find \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{34800}{240} = 145
     \]

Therefore, the cost of each cup is \(\boxed{145}\) dollars."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then figure out how much more money she needs to earn.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items:
   - The jacket costs $30.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.
   - The total cost for the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

2. Calculate how much money Sara has already earned and saved:
   - Sara has $10 saved before she starts babysitting.
   - She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.
   - Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to reach the total amount needed.

3. Calculate the total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn:
   - Sara's total savings and earnings from babysitting is $10 + $20 = $30.

4. Determine how much more money Sara needs to afford the items:
   - The total cost of the items is $70, and Sara has $30, so she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

5. Calculate how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn the additional $40:
   - Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, she needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times.

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, which is a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers by the third day.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons and the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( S = 8 \) gallons of water. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. So, the total cost is:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

So, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. So, the total amount she promised to return is:

\[ 2000 + (2000 \times 0.10) = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find Janeth's remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:

\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be $220."

"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"Let's break down the information given:

2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, we calculate Yuri's points:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri scored 10 more than this: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Next, we calculate Brianna's points:
- Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

To find Jojo's points, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
- Total points: 251

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine used 90 liters of water, so the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount of what was left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater she collected:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"To travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, it takes Andrew 6 days. 

To travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car, it will take half as many days as the bus trip, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

So, the total travel time for the round trip will be the sum of the bus trip and the car trip:

\[ 6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Andrew will travel for a total of 9 days."
"First, let's calculate the new number of each type of card after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards:

30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 total cards

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.3333... \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:

\[ 33\% \]"
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's burrito, we need to add up the cost of each item he ordered and then subtract the value of the gift card.

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces per minute.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
3. The number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones home is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
4. When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at that time is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
5. The number of watermelons remaining after harvesting the 63 ready ones is:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = $20,000 * 12 = $240,000.

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Tax on the cars = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

3. **Registration fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total registration fees = $1,000 * 12 = $12,000.

4. **Total amount paid:**
   - Total amount = Cost of the cars + Tax on the cars + Registration fees
   - Total amount = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, she collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

"There are 36 penguins sunbathing initially.

One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean:
36 / 3 = 12 penguins

Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner:
36 / 3 = 12 penguins

So, the total number of penguins that are no longer sunbathing is:
12 + 12 = 24 penguins

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
36 - 24 = 12 penguins

12 penguins are still left sunbathing."
"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find out how many tomatoes they need in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (days in a week):
9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes is:
63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

- Number of pizzas needed = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza = 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. When he uses these pens, he will have 25 empty pens.
3. He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, with 25 empty pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new full pens.
4. After making these 5 new pens, he will have 5 empty pens left from the process of making the new pens.
5. Now, he has 5 new full pens and 5 empty pens, making a total of 10 pens.
6. He can again mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 more full pen. So, he can make 1 more pen from the 5 empty pens he has.
7. After making this pen, he will have 1 empty pen left from the process of making the new pen.
8. Now, he has 6 full pens and 1 empty pen, making a total of 7 pens.
9. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 more full pen. So, he can make 1 more pen from the 5 empty pens he has (including the 1 empty pen he had left).
10. After making this pen, he will have 1 empty pen left from the process of making the new pen.
11. Now, he has 7 full pens and 1 empty pen, making a total of 8 pens.
12. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 more full pen. So, he can make 1 more pen from the 5 empty pens he has (including the 1 empty pen he had left).
13. After making this pen, he will have 1 empty pen left from the process of making the new pen.
14. Now, he has 8 full pens and 1 empty pen, making a total of 9 pens.
15. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 more full pen. So, he can make 1 more pen from the 5 empty pens he has (including the 1 empty pen he had left).
16. After making this pen, he will have 1 empty pen left from the process of making the new pen.
17. Now, he has 9 full pens and 1 empty pen, making a total of 10 pens.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is 30.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of the students went out through exit A.
   - 30% of 1000 = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students.

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:
   - Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700 students.

3. 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:
   - 3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B:
   - Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280 students.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. So we can write:

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
\[ \text{James's candies} = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

"Mike was originally a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with 3 people.

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, Mike receives \(3 \times 2 \times 5 = 30\) pages of letters a week.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages of letters a week.

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[
\frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day.
- Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- She needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
- Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days = $6000.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie:

- Total cost for 5 weeks = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30000.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- 10% of $30000 = 0.10 * $30000 = $3000.
- Discounted total cost = $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

So, Jean paid $27000."

"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

So, in total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) more calories than her sister.

2. There are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so there are \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) boys and \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) girls in total.

Now, let's look at the girls in each class:
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.

So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is \(15 + 12 = 27\).

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is \(30 - 27 = 3\).

Since each class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is \(20 - 3 = 17\).

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as \( C \). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3C \).

It's also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, \( C = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

Now, we can find the number of wolves killed today:
\[ 3C = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

So, today Rick killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the animals killed last night and today:

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the total number of cows before Mr. Sylas buys more. There are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we add the 2 new cows to each stall's original 20 cows:

\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows/stall} \]

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

"Each 10-foot section of the redwood weighs 400 pounds. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, it has 20 sections (200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections).

The total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any part of it would be:
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds.

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 30% of 8000 pounds is:
0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds.

The remaining weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten is:
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so Harry has \( 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \) trees.

Now, to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\( 11 - 3 = 8 \)

So, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard."

"To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. Calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times \$350,000 = 0.05 \times \$350,000 = \$17,500 \]

2. Calculate the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \times \$350,000 = 0.12 \times \$350,000 = \$42,000 \]

3. Calculate the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = \$350,000 + \$17,500 + \$42,000 = \$409,500 \]

4. Calculate how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = \$409,500 - \$400,000 = \$9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. Calculate the transfer fees:
   Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000
   Transfer fees = $12,000

2. Calculate the brokerage fee:
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
   Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $400,000
   Brokerage fee = $20,000

3. Calculate the total fees:
   Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee
   Total fees = $12,000 + $20,000
   Total fees = $32,000

4. Calculate the net proceeds:
   Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Remaining loan amount
   Net proceeds = $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000
   Net proceeds = $118,000

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat it to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - So, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:** 
   - The total time is the sum of the time to heat the oil to 300 degrees, the time to heat it to 400 degrees, and the cooking time.
   - Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for newspaper ads is \( 5 \times 50 = 250 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.
- Therefore, the total cost for television ads is \( 75 \times 15 = 1125 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost for newspaper ads + Cost for television ads
- Total cost = \( 250 + 1125 = 1375 \) dollars.

The real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

To find the total number of M&Ms, we add the M&Ms from all three bags:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms.

Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

First, calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- So, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses is:
- \(2 \times 6 = 12\) windows.

Next, calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
- There are 4 additional windows in each house.
- So, for 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
- \(2 \times 4 = 8\) windows.

Now, add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
- \(12 + 8 = 20\) windows.

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves:
\[ 1800 \text{ (total stitches)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, and rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches per sleeve} \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- Number of tomato seed packets: 20
- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40
- Total cost for tomato seeds: 20 * $40 = $800

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30
- Total cost for celery seeds: 80 * $30 = $2400

Now, we add the total costs for both types of seeds:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total cost for all seeds: $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Lyrics to the Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize: \(54\) (solo song) + \(36\) (first scene) + \(48\) (second scene) = \(138\).

So, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines."

"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time for the small holes:
   - Time for one small hole = 3 minutes
   - Time for 30 small holes = 30 * 3 = 90 minutes

2. Calculate the time for the large holes:
   - Time for one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Time for 15 large holes = 15 * 10 = 150 minutes

3. Calculate the total time in minutes:
   - Total time = Time for small holes + Time for large holes
   - Total time = 90 + 150 = 240 minutes

4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - Total time in hours = 240 / 60 = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40.

Final numerical answer:
40"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Final answer:
Sam is 6 years old."

- Total cost = \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) dollars.

Therefore, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we add the total number of spots for the cobras and the mambas to find the combined total number of spots:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, we find half the number of spots they all have combined:

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

Let's start with step 1:

- Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) inches.

Next, step 2:

- The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
- The length occupied by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
- Therefore, the length occupied by the sterling silver beads is \(25 - 8 = 17\) inches.

Finally, step 3:

- Each sterling silver bead is \(\frac{1}{4}\) inch long.
- The number of sterling silver beads is the length occupied by the beads divided by the length of each bead, which is \(17 \div \frac{1}{4} = 17 \times 4 = 68\).

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 5 members in the household.
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person/meal} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
Assuming each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, the household consumes rice twice a day.
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
There are 7 days in a week.
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. The bids increase by $50 each time, and she bids after each of the 3 other people, making a total of 4 bids.

1. The first bid (opening bid) is $200.
2. The second bid is $200 + $50 = $250.
3. The third bid is $250 + $50 = $300.
4. The fourth bid is $300 + $50 = $350.

Now, we add up all the bids:

$200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100

The desk costs Carmen $1100."
"To calculate the total cost John pays for the driving service in a year, we need to break down the costs into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Daily Miles Driven:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so he drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, totaling 60 miles per day.

2. **Weekly Miles Driven:**
   - He drives 60 miles each day and works 5 days a week, so he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles per week.

3. **Annual Miles Driven:**
   - He drives 300 miles per week and works 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles per year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven in a year is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - He gives a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus for the year is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

6. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Adding the cost for the miles driven and the total bonus, the total annual cost is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

**Final Answer:**
31800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise started with 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total number of books sold is the sum of the books sold in the first, second, and third years, which is \(90 + \text{second year sales} + 45 = 200\).

From this, we can find the number of books sold in the second year:
\[90 + \text{second year sales} + 45 = 200\]
\[135 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 200 - 135\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 65\]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is $1300."
"Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of 50 hours a week. He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

50 hours * $10/hour = $500

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings including the bonus are:

$500 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800

April typically has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:

$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. 

To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

"The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
Two-thirds of 60 loaves are sold in the morning:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. This leaves:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening. Half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the person will grow an extra arm and an extra leg within that period.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   - Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 * $100 + $700 = $500 + $700 = $1200

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000, so the total amount he can spend on the trip is:
$6000 - $2000 = $4000

Now, let's add up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950

The amount left for buying gifts is:
$4000 (total for trip) - $1950 (costs of suits, suitcases, and flight ticket) = $2050

So, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the family of 5, 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
2. The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

First, calculate the daily egg consumption for the 3 people:
3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs

Next, calculate the daily egg consumption for the 2 people:
2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs

Now, add the two amounts to get the total daily egg consumption:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Since they eat eggs every day, we need to find out how many eggs they consume in a week (7 days):
13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.
4. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, which means the population was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

Now, we need to find the current population of Chile. The problem states that the population six years ago was half of what it is now. Therefore, the current population is twice the population six years ago.

So, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. Therefore, if there are 45 electric wires, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles. Then:

\[
\frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}

"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to determine the total number of pencils they have together.

Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which give a total of 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, the equation for Jam's pencils is:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

We can solve for \( x \) as follows:
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we know that Jam has 3 boxes, which means she has \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) pencils from the boxes plus 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils.

Meg has 46 pencils. Now, we add the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes they need to store all 72 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold (8 pencils per box):
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon adds to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate how much the coffee is weakened by both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes as follows:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Next, we need to determine how much the coffee is weakened by these 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so:

\[ \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Now, we need to account for the 15 milliliters of cream added. The cream also weakens the coffee, so we add this to the weakening from the ice cubes:

\[ \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the given scenario.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

Since each new record requires 2 old records, for 7 new records, the total number of old records given up is:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Since the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly salary is:

\[ \text{Salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Adding the amounts paid to both junior and senior programmers gives us the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

- Total annual pay before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

So, the value of the 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share after the decrease, we calculate:

\[ \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

\[ \$72 \]"
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can write these as equations:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:
\[ 4C + 2H = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have is:

"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling with:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (balls added each week for 4 weeks) = 7 balls

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left is:

7 - 3 = 4 balls

But 2 of those balls are caught by people in the crowd, so he still has:

4 - 2 = 2 balls

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 2 balls.

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."
"Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.

At the baby shower, Laurel received twice that amount, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) baby outfits.

Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

\[24 + 48 + 15 = 87\]

So, Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby."
"Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters, which means he should run:

\[ 5000 + \left(\frac{1}{5} \times 5000\right) = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters per day} \]

June typically has 30 days, so if Tyson trains for a month in June, the total distance he would cover is:

\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180,000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180,000 meters."

160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.

Her son's lunch box gets 4 cookies, 5 days a week. So, the total number of cookies her son eats in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ cookies/week} + 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 27 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Subtracting the cookies eaten by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies in a bag, we get the number of cookies Jenny eats:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies/week} - 27 \text{ cookies/week} = 9 \text{ cookies/week} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount:

"To find out what percentage more the factory is making per day now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily revenue from silos.
3. Find the difference between the two daily revenues.
4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the original revenue.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Daily revenue from tractors:**
   - Number of tractors sold per day: 10
   - Price per tractor: $100
   - Daily revenue from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

2. **Daily revenue from silos:**
   - Number of silos sold per day: 5
   - Price per silo: $220
   - Daily revenue from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

3. **Difference in daily revenue:**
   - Difference = Daily revenue from silos - Daily revenue from tractors
   - Difference = $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day

4. **Percentage increase:**
   - Percentage increase = (Difference / Original revenue) * 100%
   - Percentage increase = ($100/day / $1000/day) * 100% = 0.1 * 100% = 10%

The factory is making 10% more per day now.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To calculate the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to break down the costs for each item and then sum them up for a year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is \(25 \times 4 = 100\) dollars.
   - For a year, the cost for food is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for treats is \(20 \times 12 = 240\) dollars.

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for medicine is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the yearly costs:
- Yearly cost for food: $1200
- Yearly cost for treats: $240
- Yearly cost for medicine: $1200

Total yearly cost = \(1200 + 240 + 1200 = 2640\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming:

- Boating: 6 hours
- Swimming: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total time John spent watching shows:

- Shows: 3 shows * 2 hours each = 6 hours

Now, we know that the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows (9 + 6 = 15 hours) is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time as \( T \). We can set up the equation:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:

\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \]

So, the total time John spent on vacation is 50 hours.

\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \]

Therefore, John spent 20 hours sightseeing."
"To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we first need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and then subtract the amount she already has in savings from the cost of the phone.

1. Calculate earnings from the first job:
   - Earnings = $10/hour * 20 hours = $200

2. Calculate earnings from the second job:
   - Earnings = $5/hour * 15 hours = $75

3. Calculate total earnings from both jobs:
   - Total earnings = $200 + $75 = $275

4. Calculate the total amount Annabelle has after adding her savings:
   - Total amount = $80 (initial savings) + $275 (total earnings) = $355

5. Calculate how much more she needs to save:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then we'll subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. Cost of one round of mini-golf: $5
2. Cost of go-karts (2 rides): $10 * 2 = $20
3. Arcade tokens: $5

Total cost for Morgan (including herself) is:
$5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $30

Now, subtract this from her budget to find out how much is left for her friends:
$90 (budget) - $30 (Morgan's expenses) = $60

Each friend will need the same amount as Morgan for mini-golf, go-karts, and arcade tokens, which is $30. So, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend:
$60 / $30 = 2

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that many minus 5. So, we calculate:
   \[
   4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]
   Therefore, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters. So, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
   Therefore, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons:

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples sold on Monday:**
   - Lucy got $56 from selling the apples on Monday.
   - Each apple is sold for $4.
   - Therefore, the number of apples sold on Monday is \( \frac{56}{4} = 14 \) apples.

2. **Determine the number of apples picked on Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

3. **Determine the number of apples picked on Wednesday:**
   - Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) apples.

4. **Calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days:**
   - Apples picked on Monday: 14
   - Apples picked on Tuesday: 12
   - Apples picked on Wednesday: 24
   - Total apples picked = \( 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \)

"To calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to consider the interest and the principal amount. However, the problem does not specify if the interest is simple or compound, and it also does not mention if the monthly payments include interest or just the principal. For simplicity, let's assume the interest is simple and the monthly payments are equal and include both the principal and the interest.

First, we calculate the total interest for the five months. The formula for simple interest is:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal is $3,650, the rate is 10% (or 0.10), and the time is 5/12 years (since 5 months is 5/12 of a year).

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.085 \]

So, the total amount to be paid back is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 = 3802.085 \]

Now, we need to find the monthly payment. Since the total amount is to be paid back in 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month."
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances they hiked:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

The total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, so:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups of lemonade} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take for Millie to sell all 36 cups of lemonade. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour, so:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. She sells each cup for $1, so:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue. The cost of supplies is $18, so:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

This is the total profit over the 9 hours. To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie will make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26 \]

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform.

On the day of the performance, half of the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[ \text{Girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:
- The cost for Dasha is $36.
- The cost for David is $30.
- The savings for David is \(36 - 30 = $6\).

So, David saves $6."
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we first need to determine the total number of gifts she has to wrap.

Monica has:
- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

So, the total number of gifts is \(6 + 4 + 2 = 12\).

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for these 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[
\frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift}
\]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services.

Netflix costs $10 a month.

Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but with a 20% discount for bundling, the cost for both is reduced. The discount for each service is 20% of $10, which is $2. So, each service costs $10 - $2 = $8 after the discount. Since he gets both, the total for Hulu and Disney Plus is $8 + $8 = $16.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the streaming services:
- Netflix: $10
- Hulu and Disney Plus: $16
- Total: $10 + $16 = $26

Tim's original cable subscription cost $60 a month. By switching to the streaming services, he saves:
- Original cable cost: $60
- New streaming cost: $26

"First, let's calculate the total time Carol spent on her work.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Half of that time is spent recording, which is 2 hours. She spends 90 minutes editing, which is 1.5 hours (since 90 minutes = 1.5 hours).

Now, let's add up all the time spent:

- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 2 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

Total time = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Next, we need to find out what percentage of her total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total work time is 7.5 hours.

The percentage of time spent editing is calculated as:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. So, for 8 hours, it uses:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments from May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for May = 40 × $15 × 40
Total payment for May = $24,000

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = 1/4 × 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for June = 30 × $15 × 40
Total payment for June = $18,000

**Step 4: Sum the payments from May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June

"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

5 dozens"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We can assume that the defect that makes candles smell like wet dog is independent of the defect that makes them explode. 

Given:
- 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
- 1% of the candles are guaranteed to explode (since they are 99% guaranteed not to explode).

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we can multiply the total number of candles by the probability of each defect occurring independently.

First, calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Next, calculate the number of candles that explode:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500 \]

Assuming the defects are independent, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ 2500 \times 0.01 = 25 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

Step 1: Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
The regular price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. So, the discount amount per blouse is:
\[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]
Therefore, the discount price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Step 2: Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses.
Misha picked 4 blouses, so the total cost is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

The total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet. Let's call this number \(x\).

Joanne's total apples: \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

Joanne's sister's total apples: \(60 + 45 = 105\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ (45 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

Final numerical answer:
350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( c + d = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2c + d = 304 \) because camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each.

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( d \) from the first equation:
\[ d = 180 - c \]

Next, we substitute \( d \) in the second equation:
\[ 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \]
\[ 2c + 180 - c = 304 \]
\[ c + 180 = 304 \]
\[ c = 304 - 180 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can find \( d \) using the first equation:
\[ d = 180 - c \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( \boxed{56} \)."
"In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days, so the distance for the next two days is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} \times 0.30 = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \, \text{km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Adding all these distances together, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, the total number of kilometers Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from an elevation of 10,000 feet, so the comb is now at an elevation of:

10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb:

6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"Mr. Josue received $4000 from the first bank and twice as much from the second bank, which is $4000 * 2 = $8000.

Adding the amounts from both banks to his initial capital:
$5000 (initial capital) + $4000 (from the first bank) + $8000 (from the second bank) = $17000.

Final capital: $17000."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so they carried away a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats.

After the boats carried away the cats, there were \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats left on the rock.

Then, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

Final answer: 12 cats were left on the rock."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[ 6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48 \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96 \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ \$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256 \]

The total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[ \$256 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars from the jogger jeans} \]
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars from the tattered jeans} \]

Now, let's find out the original price of the jogger jeans. Since he saved $2 on the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans must have been:

\[ 22 + 2 = 24 \]

So, the original price of the jogger jeans was $24. Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, so the difference is:

\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 more than the tattered jeans. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

1. The 4 buses can hold 60 employees each, so the total capacity for the buses is:
   \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees

2. The 6 minibusses can hold 30 employees each, so the total capacity for the minibusses is:
   \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees

3. The 10 minivans can hold 15 employees each, so the total capacity for the minivans is:
   \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
\(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\)

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Since there are 3 store-bought feeders, they will attract 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

And since there are 3 homemade feeders, they will attract 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Therefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

150 birds"
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, the cost of the cake is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[
5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy a ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

After selling the cards, he has $50 in spending cash and the cost of the ticket, which is $100, so the total money he has after selling the cards is $150.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The caterer was initially told to prepare enough hot dogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hot dogs. This means 18 guests would get two hot dogs, and the other 18 would get one hot dog.

2. The total number of hot dogs prepared would be:
   - 18 guests * 2 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs
   - 18 guests * 1 hot dog = 18 hot dogs
   - Total = 36 + 18 = 54 hot dogs

3. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the first hot dog for each of the 40 guests was provided, and now they all want a second one.

4. Since there were only 54 hot dogs prepared, and 40 guests each wanted a second hot dog, we need to see how many of those second hot dogs can be provided:
   - 54 hot dogs - 40 hot dogs (first hot dog for each guest) = 14 hot dogs left for seconds

5. Since 40 guests wanted a second hot dog and only 14 were available, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:
   - 40 guests - 14 hot dogs = 26 guests

Final numerical answer:
26 guests did not get a second hot dog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the cost of the pot and pans: $120.00
2. Calculate the cost of the mixing bowls: $20.00
3. Calculate the cost of the 5 separate utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, calculate the discount amount:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, the total cost is:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Dora has $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16, so the total amount of money Dora has is:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

So, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."

"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. George spent $5 in total.
2. He bought 3 bags of chips, each costing 40 cents.
3. He had 1% of his money left after the purchase.

First, calculate the total cost of the 3 bags of chips:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, determine how much money George had left after the purchase:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ dollars} = 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ cents} \]

Now, calculate how much money George spent on candy bars:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1.20 \text{ dollars} - 0.05 \text{ dollars} = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars George bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ \frac{3.75 \text{ dollars}}{0.75 \text{ dollars per candy bar}} = 5 \text{ candy bars} \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

Final numerical answer:

56 oranges ÷ 8 people = 7 oranges per person.

Each person will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so for 4 pounds, the cost is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, the beef stock costs $2.00 per box, and he needs 2 boxes, so the total cost for beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost for the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Therefore, the cost per serving is $2.00."
"If it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, then Bernadette's drive takes:

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads: 1 * 20 = 20 beads
- 2 packs of clear beads: 2 * 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth bought: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Now, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads: 3 * 20 = 60 beads
- 4 packs of red beads: 4 * 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth bought: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller total from the larger total:
140 - 60 = 80 beads

One sister has 80 more beads than the other.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.
2. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.

So, the temperature increase from baking is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Adding this to the initial temperature:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. Marcus then opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

The cooling effect over 30 minutes is:
30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3
3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

Therefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so:

- Swim time for James = 40 minutes * (1 - 0.10) = 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

- Bike time for James = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Let's denote the time James took for the run as \( R \) minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

- Total time for James = 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we can set up the equation for James's total time:

\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):

\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

Final numerical answer:

"Movie C is 1.25 hours long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60:

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long."
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

30 minutes is half an hour, so the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money he has:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs equal 48 eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, she has a total of 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the total number of glasses of eggnog she can make is 50 eggs divided by 5 eggs per glass, which equals 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is the total number of glasses divided by the number of glasses per tray. So, 10 glasses divided by 5 glasses per tray equals 2 trays.

Final numerical answer:
2 trays"

2. The revenue from the flash sale is 17 sneakers * $20/sneaker = $340.

For step 3:

3. The number of sneakers sold to the department store is 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers. The revenue from the department store is 31 sneakers * $25/sneaker = $775.

For step 4:

4. The total revenue is $340 (from the flash sale) + $775 (from the department store) = $1115.

Finally, for step 5:

5. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $1115 - $576 = $539.

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in each type of packet and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of crayons in the six packets that each contain 8 pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ crayons/packet} = 48 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets that each contain 16 pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ crayons/packet} = 64 \text{ crayons} \]

Now, we add the two quantities together to find the total number of crayons:
\[ 48 \text{ crayons} + 64 \text{ crayons} = 112 \text{ crayons} \]

Therefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is:
112"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Super ticket: $20 + $1 for popcorn and soda = $21
2. Regular ticket: $12 + cost of popcorn + $3 for soda
3. You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the cost of the regular ticket and the popcorn and soda should be $2 more than the super ticket.

The cost of the super ticket is $21. Since you saved $2, the cost of the regular ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $21 + $2 = $23.

Given that the soda costs $3, we can set up the following equation to find the regular price of the popcorn (let's call it \( P \)):

\[ 12 + P + 3 = 23 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 12 + P + 3 = 23 \]
\[ 15 + P = 23 \]
\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $8.

Final numerical answer:
8"
"First, let's determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900, so the cost per balloon is:

\[ \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars per balloon} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars per balloon} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons at the new price. The total cost for 170 balloons is:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 11050 \]

So, Bentley paid:

\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find the car's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

1. For the first part of the trip:
   - Speed = 60 mph
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. For the second part of the trip:
   - Speed = 30 mph
   - Time = 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

3. Total distance traveled = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

4. Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

5. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 of them for 2 rubies. 

First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires she trades:
3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400

After the trade, she has 5 sapphires left:
5 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $4000

She also gains 2 rubies from the trade:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, let's add the value of the remaining sapphires and the rubies:
$4000 (remaining sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total Volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's calculate the number of green cards. If there are 15 red cards and there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can find the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = 15 + (60% of 15)
= 15 + (0.60 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

Final numerical answer:
78"
"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.

After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies. These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies, so the total number of fairies became \( 50 + 25 = 75 \).

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

**Final Answer: 45**"
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) + 48 (carrots) + 2 (sugar cubes) = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip):

- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"Grayson recycles 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles each week.

For the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents/week (from cans) + 15 cents/week (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

For a four-week month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 60\% \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

3. She moved ahead 2 spots: \(100 - 2 = 98\). So, she is now in 98th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(98 - 3 = 95\). So, she is now in 95th place.
5. She jumped ahead 1 spot: \(95 + 1 = 96\). So, she is now in 96th place.

Therefore, Finley finished the race in 96th place."
"Miss Maria has 6 decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck, so she has a total of:

\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

She also has 5 boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box, so she has a total of:

\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Adding the basketball and baseball cards together, she has:

\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \text{ cards} \]

She keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

First, let's define the sets:
- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)
- Total number of kids in the class, \( |U| = 32 \)

We need to find the number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the allergens, which is \( |D \cup P| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens.

To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one allergen from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = |U| - |D \cup P| \]
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

"Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, who has 20 songs. So, Luri has \(3 \times 20 = 60\) songs.

The maximum capacity of each player is 100 songs. Therefore, the number of songs Gabriel can still add to his player is \(100 - 20 = 80\) songs.

Similarly, the number of songs Luri can still add to his player is \(100 - 60 = 40\) songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
2. Each horse is fed twice a day, so each horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).
3. Uncle Ben has four horses, so the total consumption per day is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).
4. For five days, the total consumption is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).
5. Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"Jana has 27 puppies. Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.

First, we calculate the number of Pomeranians:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18 \]

One third of the Pomeranians are girls.

Now, we calculate the number of girl Pomeranians:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \]

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."
"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we first need to add the highest temperatures together and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48°F
- Northlandia: 21°F
- Midlandia: -3°F

Adding these together:
-48 + 21 - 3 = -30°F

Now, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
-30 / 3 = -10°F

The average highest temperature of these three countries is -10°F."
"The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is:

$12 - $4 = $8

If he saves $2 daily, the number of days it will take him to save the remaining $8 is:

$8 ÷ $2/day = 4 days

It will take him 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"Jaime has 64 eggs and 2 trays that can each hold 24 eggs. 

First, calculate the total capacity of the 2 trays:
2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Now, subtract the total capacity of the trays from the number of eggs Jaime has:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

"To determine the cost per razor after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Heather is buying 2 packs.
   - Total cost before discounts: \(2 \times \$4.00 = \$8.00\).

2. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale:**
   - Since the offer is ""buy one get one free,"" Heather only pays for one pack and gets the second one free.
   - Cost after the sale: \$4.00 (for the first pack).

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon from the sale price.
   - Cost after the coupon: \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00.

4. **Calculate the cost per razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors: \(2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors/pack} = 8 \text{ razors}\).
   - Cost per razor: \(\frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}\).

5. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - \$0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor, in cents, after the discount is **25 cents**."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to identify the height of the shortest cheerleader, as she will be at the top of the pyramid.

Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall, the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The height of the human pyramid will be the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours each day. So, each day she walks:

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14, Angela will be \(3 \times 14 = 42\) years old in four years.
4. If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, then her current age is \(42 - 4 = 38\) years old.

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela is 38 years old.**"
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

Each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2.

For the morning rides, he spends:
14 days * $6/ride = $84

For the afternoon rides, he spends:
14 days * $2/ride = $28

Adding the costs of the morning and afternoon rides together:
$84 + $28 = $112

Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so Ashley brought a total of \(5 \times 10 = 50\) oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought \(50 + 20 = 70\) oranges.

Together, Ashley and Brianne brought \(50 + 70 = 120\) oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is \(120 \div 3 = 40\).

**40**"
"Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. So the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, and food is already included. So the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the number of guests \( x \) for which the costs of the two venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects David found as \(D\), the number of insects Bodhi found as \(B\), and the number of insects Lily found as \(L\).

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in the first equation with their expressions in terms of \(D\):
\[L + D + B = 43\]
\[(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43\]
\[4D + 7 = 43\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[4D = 36\]

Divide by 4:
\[D = 9\]

Now, we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16\]
\[B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18\]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide. So, the width of the rug is:

3 feet (width of the chair) + 5 feet = 8 feet (width of the rug)

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we calculate twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:

2 * 8 feet (width of the rug) + 2 feet = 16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of those packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost of all the packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."

"To determine the cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs.
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2.
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. 

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, but the farm does not have any cows, so this statement is irrelevant to the number of animals on the farm.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 10 sheep (since 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep).

Now, let's add up all the animals:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.

Combined, the farm and the zoo have 40 animals + 20 animals = 60 animals.

60 animals"

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
2. Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.

Step 1: Total calories to burn
Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb. Therefore, the total calories to burn is:
\[ 30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 2: Number of days
Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to July 19th): 19 days

Adding these up:
\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

Step 3: Daily calorie deficit
To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories to burn by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."

- Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml.

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"Julie initially had $500.

First, she spent 20% of $500 on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

So, after buying clothes, she had:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

So, after buying CDs, she had:
$400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie had $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has:

- Ali has four $10 bills, so the total from the $10 bills is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali has six $20 bills, so the total from the $20 bills is \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total amount of money Ali has is \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars.

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister:

- Half of $160 is \(\frac{160}{2} = 80\) dollars.

So, after giving half to his sister, Ali has \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars left.

Then, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner:

- \(\frac{3}{5}\) of $80 is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48\) dollars.

So, after buying dinner, Ali has \(80 - 48 = 32\) dollars left.

The amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."

Solving for \( H \):
\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

If Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \]

This remaining $4 is exactly the cost of one CD. Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and he worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week, we can determine the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours as follows:

8 weeks (total) - 2 weeks (5 hours) - 1 week (6 hours) = 5 weeks (4 hours)

Now, we can calculate the total hours for these weeks:
5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours

Next, we calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours:
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

And for the week where he worked out for 6 hours:
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add all these hours together to get the total number of hours spent working out over the 8 weeks:
20 hours (4 hours/week) + 10 hours (5 hours/week) + 6 hours (6 hours/week) = 36 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 36 hours."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:
\[
\boxed{66}

"Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so currently, he is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age, so the cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

Currently, Jame's cousin is 55 - 8 = 47 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin now is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"Given:
- Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400.
- He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer.
- The computer cost $1,100.

First, let's find the cost of the printer:
- The printer cost $400 less than the computer.
- Therefore, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
- The computer cost $1,100.
- The printer cost $700.
- Together, they cost $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. So, the cost of the 2 monitors is:
- $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is:
- $600 / 2 = $300.

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"The boys brought back 60 shells each. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the girls brought back 60 (the same as the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times as many as the boys) shells.

Let's calculate that:

4 * 60 = 240

So, the girls brought back 60 + 240 = 300 shells.

Since the girls were divided into two equal groups, each group of girls brought back half of the total number of shells the girls brought.

300 / 2 = 150

Each girl brought back 150 seashells.

"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 31 mm * 2 = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add the thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these up: \(18 + 21 + 15 = 54\) vlogs.

Now, to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\(72 - 54 = 18\)

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."
"To calculate how much you end up paying, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total bill including the tip.
2. Split the total bill evenly between you and your wife.

First, let's calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill:
\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

Now, add the tip to the original bill to get the total bill:
\[ \text{Total bill} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since you want to pay an additional 20% tip on the $50 bill, you will pay your share of the total bill, which is half of $60:
\[ \text{Your share} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

So, you end up paying:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month to meet his target of $1125.

First, let's break down the month into two halves:
- The first half of the month consists of 15 days.
- The second half of the month also consists of 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount saved in the first half of the month is \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much each day in the second half of the month. So, the amount he saves each day in the second half of the month is \( 2x \). Therefore, the total amount saved in the second half of the month is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

The total amount saved in the entire month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month. Since he saves twice as much each day in the second half of the month, the amount he saves each day in the second half is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, the amount Elvis has to save each day in the second half of the month is $50.

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the total number of toys in a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys, the sorted play set would have:
   \[
   5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
   \]

2. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set of 400 toys. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys to reach 400 toys, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 2 = 400

"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to find the cost of each item without the discount, then sum these costs, and finally apply the 10% discount.

1. Cost of five notebooks: \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\)
2. Cost of two pens: \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\)
3. Cost of one calculator: \(1 \times \$12 = \$12.00\)
4. Cost of one geometry set: \(1 \times \$10 = \$10.00\)

Now, we sum these amounts to get the total cost before the discount:
\[ \$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$30.00 = 0.10 \times \$30.00 = \$3.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$30.00 - \$3.00 = \$27.00 \]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\$27.00\) on all the items he wants to buy."

"To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we need to calculate the total amount of money each of them made and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how much money Mitchell made:
- Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each.
- So, Mitchell's total earnings = 21 * $4 = $84.

Next, we know that Liam made $63.

Now, we find the difference between Mitchell's and Liam's earnings:
- Difference = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings
- Difference = $84 - $63 = $21.

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Peter has $70 to spend over one week (7 days).
2. He spends an equal amount each day, so he spends $70 / 7 = $10 each day.
3. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. That's 4 days.
4. The total amount spent on wooden action figures is $10/day * 4 days = $40.
5. The number of wooden action figures he can buy is $40 / $5 = 8 action figures.
6. After Wednesday, he has $70 - $40 = $30 left.
7. For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. That's 4 days.
8. The total amount he can spend on plastic action figures is $30.
9. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is $30 / $2 = 15 action figures.
10. The total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 8 (wooden) + 15 (plastic) = 23 action figures.

Final numerical answer:
23"
"To find out how much the kitten has cost Leah so far, we need to add up the costs of the spaying, the vaccines, and the broken vases.

1. Spaying cost: $200
2. 3 vaccines at $20 each: 3 * $20 = $60
3. 4 broken vases at $12 each: 4 * $12 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (vases) = $308

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month (assuming an average month has about 4 weeks).
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per month.
4. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
5. Find the difference between the number of roses Ford grows in a month and the number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

Let's start with step 1:

Ford supplies:
- 20 roses to the first flower shop
- 15 roses to the second flower shop
- 30 roses to the third flower shop

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 2: Assuming an average month has 4 weeks, the total number of roses supplied per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Step 3: Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month (4 weeks), he grows:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Step 4: Now, we find the difference between the number of roses Ford grows in a month and the number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month:
260 roses needed - 160 roses grown = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Cost of Bread:**
   - Each loaf of bread costs $3.00.
   - Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.

2. **Cost of Cheeses and Condiments:**
   - They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

3. **Total Cost per Sandwich:**
   - Total cost per sandwich = Cost of bread per sandwich + Cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich
   - Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30.

4. **Revenue per Sandwich:**
   - They sell each sandwich for $7.00.

5. **Net Profit per Sandwich:**
   - Net profit per sandwich = Revenue per sandwich - Total cost per sandwich
   - Net profit per sandwich = $7.00 - $3.30 = $3.70.

6. **Net Profit for 10 Sandwiches:**
   - If they sell 10 sandwiches, the net profit is 10 * $3.70 = $37.00.

Therefore, the net profit is $37.00."

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown:

- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

Now, let's add these numbers together to get the total number of birds:

50 (days 1 and 2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (days 4 and 5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7) = 300 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:

300 birds / 7 days = 42.85714285714286 birds per day

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the average is approximately 43 birds per day.

Average number of birds Mack saw in a day: 43"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. We need to add half of the starting value to the starting value.
3. Then, we divide the result by 5.
4. Finally, we multiply the result by the starting value minus 12.

Let's denote the starting value as \( x \). In this case, \( x = 20 \).

Step 1: Calculate half of the starting value and add it to the starting value.
\[ \text{Half of } x = \frac{x}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Starting value plus half of the starting value} = x + \frac{x}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Step 2: Divide the result by 5.
\[ \frac{30}{5} = 6 \]

Step 3: Subtract 12 from the starting value.
\[ x - 12 = 20 - 12 = 8 \]

Step 4: Multiply the result from step 2 by the result from step 3.
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

The final value of the number train is \(\boxed{48}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature would result in the oven being 4% too hot and equal to 520 degrees.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. The oven will then be 4% too hot, so it will read:

\[ x + 0.04x = 1.04x \]

We want this to equal 520 degrees:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]

\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is 120 minutes, the second movie is:
\[ 120 + 5 = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 + 125 = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% less than the value of Herb's house, which is $76,000.

First, we calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Next, we subtract this amount from the value of Herb's house to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought, which means her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by both is 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 + 68 = 120.

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

10% of $100.00 is:
\[ 100.00 \times \frac{10}{100} = 10.00 \]

So, the discount amount is $10.00. The price after the discount for one box is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Now, if Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for 2 boxes is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total hours each person worked.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each person. Since they are paid $10 per hour:

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

For running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed (in ml) = (Total calories burned / 200) * 100

Plugging in the numbers:
(1600 / 200) * 100 = 8 * 100 = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will also invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, there are 10 more people invited this way.
4. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will be bringing their spouses. So, there are 8 additional people (spouses) coming.

Now, let's sum up all the people:

- Initial email invites: 100
- Additional people from email invites: 200
- Friends invited by phone: 10
- Spouses: 8

Total number of seats needed = \(100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318\)

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

Step 1: Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, 200 grams (which is double the amount) will contain double the protein:
\[ 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Step 2: John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so in a week (7 days), he will consume:
\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:

\[ -J = -10 \]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

- The base price for 2 implants is \(2 \times \$2000 = \$4000\).
- The extra cost for the porcelain crown is \( \$500 \).

So, the total cost for the dental work is \( \$4000 + \$500 = \$4500 \).

George has already put down a deposit of \( \$600 \), so the remaining amount he needs to pay is \( \$4500 - \$600 = \$3900 \).

George makes \( \$15 \) per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn \( \$3900 \), we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

\[ \frac{\$3900}{\$15 \text{ per hour}} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ x = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."

- Colby has 6 dimes, which is 6 * 5 = 30 nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 = 70 nickels.
- Colby has 15 pennies, which is 15 / 5 = 3 nickels.

Now, we add all the nickels together:
40 (from quarters) + 30 (from dimes) + 14 (from nickels) + 3 (from pennies) = 87 nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 87 gumballs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \text{ pounds}) = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, the weight turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games on Birthday**: Steve gets 5 games on his birthday.
2. **Games Bought in the First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
3. **Games Bought in the Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
4. **Games Bought in the Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.
5. **Games Received for Christmas**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, so he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add all these up:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles.

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, he can make:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa makes:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours. Ruiz can make:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

And Marissa can make:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts together to find the total amount of chocolates they made together:

\[ 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ 1800 \text{ pounds} \]"
"Let's break down the spending:

- On Monday, Howard spends $8.
- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money Howard spent:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \]

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \]

So, Howard has $12 left."
"To find out how much money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each period and then sum them up.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- So, in one hour, he earned 15 cups * $0.50 = $7.50.
- Over four hours, he earned 4 hours * $7.50 = $30.00.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- So, in one hour, he earned 10 cups * $0.60 = $6.00.
- Over two hours, he earned 2 hours * $6.00 = $12.00.

Now, we add the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per month.
2. Calculate the total number of rotations per year.
3. Determine how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per month.**

Given that the car drives 2 miles and the tires rotate 725 times, we can find the number of rotations per mile:
\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \]

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so the total number of rotations per month is:
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of rotations per year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of rotations per year is:
\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000}{1,740,000} = 6 \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:

\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, and it provides 120 washings:

\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we convert the cost per washing to cents:

\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we need to find the cost per pump. Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \times 20 \text{ cents} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

However, this is the total cost for 60 washings. The cost per pump is simply the cost per washing:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy.

The shirt costs $25 and there is a 30% discount on it. So, the discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

The discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts cost $35 and there is no discount mentioned for them, so the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, let's add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend, but the total cost of the outfit is $52.50. Since the total cost exceeds the amount Joe has, he cannot afford the outfit with the given budget. 

However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically and we proceed with the calculation as if he could buy it, we would subtract the total cost from the amount Joe has:
\[ 50 - 52.50 = -2.50 \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates Joe would be $2.50 short of the total cost. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ -2.50 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

For Monica's street:
- Length: 150 meters
- Cost per meter: $194
- Total cost for Monica's street: 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100

For Lewis' street:
- Length: 490 meters
- Cost per meter: $194
- Total cost for Lewis' street: 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
- Cost difference: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

Therefore, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"John initially gets funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months. The research ends up taking 10 times that long, so it takes 50 months in total. The first 5 months cost $100,000, and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month.

Let's calculate the cost for the remaining 45 months:

- For the 6th month, the cost is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.
- For the 7th month, the cost is $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000.
- For the 8th month, the cost is $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500.
- And so on...

The cost for each month after the first 5 months forms a geometric series with the first term \(a = 150,000\) and the common ratio \(r = 1.5\).

The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
\[ S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]

Here, \(n = 45\) (the number of terms in the series after the first 5 months).

\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1 - 1.5^{45}}{1 - 1.5} \]

First, calculate \(1.5^{45}\):
\[ 1.5^{45} \approx 1,188,137,744.7 \]

Now, substitute this value into the formula:
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1 - 1,188,137,744.7}{1 - 1.5} \]
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{-1,188,137,743.7}{-0.5} \]
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \times 2,376,275,487.4 \]
\[ S_{45} \approx 356,441,323,110 \]

Now, add the initial $100,000 to this amount to get the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 100,000 + 356,441,323,110 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} \approx 356,441,423,110 \]

So, the total cost of John's research is approximately $356,441,423,110."
"The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the team consumed a total of 30 ounces of meat."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, and there are 1000 members in the group. So, the total number of posts per day for the group is:

\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:

\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:

"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons of water.

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so for 2080 gallons, Gary spends 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent, let's break down the costs:

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish: 20 at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, let's add all these costs together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches tall.

The final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches."
"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat in the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Divide the total amount of meat by the amount Prince sells in one day to find the number of days it will take to sell all the meat.

Step 1: The total amount of meat in the bull is 750kg.

Step 2: Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: To find out how many days it will take to sell 750kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount sold per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium:

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators:

72 seats / 4 = 18 seats occupied by administrators

The remaining seats after the administrators are seated:

72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:

54 seats / 3 = 18 seats occupied by parents

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students:

54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats occupied by students

"Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the number of street lights at one intersection is:

\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:

\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

"John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time. So, each week he had 2 sessions of 2 hours each, which totals 4 hours per week.

The cost per hour is $125, so for 4 hours per week, the cost would be:

4 hours/week * $125/hour = $500/week

Since he went for 6 weeks, the total cost would be:

$500/week * 6 weeks = $3000

The total cost for the physical therapy is $3000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces of gum at school.
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.
4. After these chews, he has \( 20 - 4 - 1 - 1 = 14 \) pieces of gum left.
5. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) pieces.
6. Therefore, at the end of the day, he has \( 14 - 7 = 7 \) pieces of gum left.

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to reach the required height of 4 feet:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference:

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To calculate how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Total Revenue from Selling the Cars:**
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Total Cost to Acquire the Cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **James's Commission on the Profit:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{17,500}

"First, let's calculate how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we have:

\[ 100 \text{ riders} \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders can stay upright} \]

Next, we know that 60% of these riders who can stay upright are women. Therefore, the number of women who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women can stay upright} \]

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} - 15 \text{ women} = 10 \text{ men can stay upright} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, let's find the price of the gold jewel:
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \]

Next, let's find the price of the silver jewel:
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, let's find the total price for all three jewels:

"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Naomi caught 17 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes.

The total cost for 10 classes is $60. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is:

\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

Since $6 is less than $10, Manny can attend all 10 classes without the cost per class exceeding $10. Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss is:

\[ 10 - 0 = 10 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 10 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many customers Julie processes per day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers each processes in a week.
3. Add the weekly totals to get the combined total.

First, we know that Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers per day.

Next, we calculate the weekly production for each:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day, so in a week (7 days), she processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers.
- Julie processes 100 customers per day, so in a week, she processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers.

Adding these together, the total weekly production for the two is \(350 + 700 = 1050\).

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.

Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran \(20 - 3 = 17\) miles.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. Calculate the cost of one apple:
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30.

2. Calculate the cost of one orange:
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10.

3. Calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
   - The cost for 5 apples is 5 × $1.30 = $6.50.
   - The cost for 5 oranges is 5 × $1.10 = $5.50.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

So, the volume of the hole is:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, we add all these amounts together:

\[
30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500
\]

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \text{Original Monthly Salary} + (\text{Original Monthly Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + (\$20,000 \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + \$1,000 \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$21,000 \]

Next, we add the bonus worth half a month's salary to the new monthly salary:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary with Bonus} = \text{New Monthly Salary} + \left(\frac{\text{New Monthly Salary}}{2}\right) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary with Bonus} = \$21,000 + \left(\frac{\$21,000}{2}\right) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary with Bonus} = \$21,000 + \$10,500 \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary with Bonus} = \$31,500 \]

Now, to find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we multiply the new monthly salary with bonus by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Salary} = \text{New Monthly Salary with Bonus} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Salary} = \$31,500 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Salary} = \$378,000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."
"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 3 * 10 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts.
   - Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final numerical answer is:
$10800."

"To find out how much flour was in three bags before it was divided into portions, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of flour in one bag.
2. Multiply that amount by three to find the total for three bags.

Step 1: Each portion is 2 kilograms, and there are 8 portions in one bag. So, the total amount of flour in one bag is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/portion} \times 8 \, \text{portions} = 16 \, \text{kg} \]

Step 2: Since we have three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:
\[ 16 \, \text{kg/bag} \times 3 \, \text{bags} = 48 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:

"To find the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance biked by both:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

The total number of miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil. For the 24 feet of soil, it will take him:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

He can dig half as fast through clay, which means he digs at a rate of 2 feet per hour. For the 8 feet of clay, it will take him:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the time for both soil and clay:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
2. The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats in the first month. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were $400 * 2 = $800.
3. The total sales in the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.
4. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month were $1200 * 3/4 = $900.
5. The total sales over the two months would be the sum of the sales from the first and second months, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rental cost: $5,000
3. Monthly fuel cost: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for hanger and fuel:
$5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000

For the first year, there are 12 months, so the total cost for hanger and fuel for the year is:
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Adding the initial cost of the plane to the yearly cost of hanger and fuel:
$150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (hanger and fuel) = $330,000

Therefore, the total cost for the first year is $330,000."
"If it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, and it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, then it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.

The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.

Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, it took her 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to cook beans.

To find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:

30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

Therefore, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

- Difference in cost: \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm."

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they have together:

\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally among them, each person would get:

Now, we know the distribution of her moods for the first 24 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Next 8 days: 8 bad days
- Following 8 days: 10 neutral days

For the next 3 days, the moods are given as good, neutral, and good. So, we add these to the count of good days:
Good days from the first 24 days: 8
Good days from the next 3 days: 2 (since 2 out of 3 are good)

Total good days = 8 + 2 = 10

So, the number of good days left in the month is 10."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 2S + 3 \]

We are also given that Janey has 21 books. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Final numerical answer:
9"
"First, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach this height, we subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

4. After buying the toys, the number of dogs doubled, so there are now 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.
6. When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so the number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21.
7. James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he doesn't need to buy any more toys.

Now, let's sum up the total number of toys James needs to buy:

- First purchase: 8 toys
- Second purchase: 12 toys

Total toys needed: 8 + 12 = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The initial total investment is $1200.

2. Dylan invests 2/5 of the total amount:
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480
   \]

3. After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

4. Frances invests 2/3 of the remaining amount:
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480
   \]

5. After Frances's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 720 - 480 = 240
   \]

6. Skyler's investment is the rest of the remaining amount:
   \[
   \text{Skyler's investment} = 240
   \]

So, Skyler's investment is $240."
"To reach their goal of 100 signatures, we first need to find out how many signatures they currently have together. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures, so together they have:

20 + 44 = 64 signatures

To find out how many more signatures they need to collect to reach 100, we subtract the number of signatures they currently have from their goal:

100 - 64 = 36

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"Lorie earns $10 per hour. Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, so Karen earns $20 per hour.

If Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings are:
$20/hour * 3 hours/day = $60/day

Over two days, Karen earns:
$60/day * 2 days = $120

Karen earns $120 in two days."
"To solve this, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

So, for 96 potatoes, we can calculate the number of hash browns as follows:

\[
\frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives us:

\[
6x = 96 \times 36
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{96 \times 36}{6} = 16 \times 36 = 576
\]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"To find out by how much the group of adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 adults and then subtract the maximum load of the elevator.

1. Calculate the total weight of the 9 adults:
   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
   - There are 9 adults in total.
   - Total weight = 80 kg/adult * 9 adults = 720 kg.

2. Subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight of the adults:
   - Maximum load of the elevator = 700 kg.
   - Excess weight = Total weight of adults - Maximum load of the elevator.
   - Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

The group of adults will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies:

- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = \(68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\)

Therefore, they have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the length is increased by \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the final length of the dress is the original length plus the extension plus the lace trim:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

Final answer: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

Now, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times for both modes to find the total time:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

So, the time they have already spent is:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

The total time they have is 30 minutes, so the time they have left is:
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

Therefore, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."
"Catherine buys:
- 1 kilo of apples for $4
- 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, which totals $2 * 2 = $4
- 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo, which totals $3 * 2 = $6

$4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, which is 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Together, they have 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

They eat 10 of the cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80.

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Since one twin is 7 years older than the younger triplet, the age of this twin would be \( x + 7 \).

The other triplet and the other twin would be the same age as the younger triplet and the younger twin, respectively, because they are part of a set of twins and a set of triplets. So, the other triplet is also \( x \) years old, and the other twin is also \( x + 7 \) years old.

The combined ages of all four individuals are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 4x + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the younger triplet is 7.5 years old. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the younger triplet, is:

\[ x + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 14.5 years old."
"First, let's convert the 3 hours before John has to eat dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we'll add up the time John needs to finish his homework:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Now, we'll subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap:
180 minutes (total time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap.

100 minutes"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought four candies for $3.20. So, the cost of one candy is:
\[ \text{Cost of one candy} = \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Next, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Manolo bought five lollipops, but we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops:
\[ \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 candies:
\[ \text{Cost of 10 candies} = 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to get the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of coins each person has saved over a period of ten years, given their monthly savings rates.

First, let's determine how many coins Rong saves in a month and then over ten years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Over ten years (which is 120 months), Rong will save:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, let's calculate how many coins Neil saves in a month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong each month. So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins} \right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

Over ten years (120 months), Neil will save:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
\[ 5760 \]"
"Let's break down the costs first:

1. The cost of the two vaccines is $20 each, so that's $20 * 2 = $40.
2. Let the total bill be \( T \).
3. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so it's \( 0.60T \).
4. The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \$5.0 + \$6.0 + \$21.0 = \$32.0

The price for such a crate of fruit is **$32.0**."

- Blue squares: 4 more than red squares, so 14 + 4 = 18
- Green squares: 6 more than blue squares, so 18 + 6 = 24
- White squares: 12 fewer than green squares, so 24 - 12 = 12

Now, let's add up all the squares:

14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares

Since each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points = 50 + (30/100 * 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points = 65 - 30 = 35 points.
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta's points = 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:

Adam's points: 50
Betty's points: 65
Tom's points: 35

"The cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second

To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount to be raised is:

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Next, we need to find out how much money they raised in the first 3 hours. Since the problem states that the amount raised is equal in every hour, we can calculate the hourly rate by dividing the amount raised in the first 3 hours by 3:

$2100 / 3 = $700 per hour

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to reach the remaining goal of $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate:

$4200 / $700 = 6 hours

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours to reach their goal.

Total hours needed to fundraise to reach the goal: 6 hours."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract that percentage from the total percentage used by the city to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: Subtract the industrial usage from the total usage by the city to find the non-industrial usage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then sum the amounts produced in the given time.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for each type of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we sum the total production of both types of ice cream:
- Total quarts produced in 48 hours = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00 and subtract it from the total:

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

Total bill after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how the deal works. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, if she buys 2 scoops, she gets 3 scoops in total. 

If she buys 4 scoops, she would get 2 free scoops (since 4 / 2 = 2), making a total of 6 scoops.

Therefore, Erin should buy 4 scoops to maximize her ice cream consumption with the deal.

**Final Answer: 4 scoops**"
"Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Both started with 100 pieces, so after two weeks, Ginger has:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And Amy has:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks."
"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden would need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area that needs to be covered: two thirds of the 36 sq ft bathroom.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed for that area, given that 24 tiles are required per square foot.

Step 1: Calculate the area to be covered.
\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \, \text{sq ft} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of tiles needed.

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom."
"To calculate how much James saved, we need to determine the total cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking the blueberries:**
   - Base cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Base cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost of picking = $65

2. **Cost of buying the blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost at the store = Cost per pound * Pounds
   Total cost at the store = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost at the store = $75

3. **Savings:**
   Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost of picking
   Savings = $75 - $65
   Savings = $10

James saved $10 compared to buying the blueberries at the store."
"First, let's calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.

The original price per computer was $700. A 10% increase on $700 is calculated as follows:

\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:

\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money they paid to buy 500 computers at the new price, we multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers:

\[ 770 \times 500 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

\[ 385,000 \]"
"To calculate the total calories in John's omelet, we need to consider the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs. Each egg is 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese. Each ounce of cheese is 120 calories.
   - Total calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories

3. **Ham**: John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz. Each ounce of ham is 40 calories.
   - Total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories

Now, we add up all the calories:
- Total calories = Calories from eggs + Calories from cheese + Calories from ham
- Total calories = 450 calories + 240 calories + 80 calories = 770 calories

**Final Answer: 770 calories**"

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps for the 3 minutes when her arms are not raised:
- Right foot: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot: 250 taps per minute

For 3 minutes, the total taps for the right foot are:
\[ 300 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 3 \, \text{minutes} = 900 \, \text{taps} \]

For 3 minutes, the total taps for the left foot are:
\[ 250 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 3 \, \text{minutes} = 750 \, \text{taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the taps for the 2 minutes when her arms are raised:
- Right foot: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot: 200 taps per minute

For 2 minutes, the total taps for the right foot are:
\[ 200 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 2 \, \text{minutes} = 400 \, \text{taps} \]

For 2 minutes, the total taps for the left foot are:
\[ 200 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 2 \, \text{minutes} = 400 \, \text{taps} \]

Now, we sum up the taps for both feet:
- Total right foot taps: \( 900 + 400 = 1300 \)
- Total left foot taps: \( 750 + 400 = 1150 \)

The combined total number of taps is:
\[ 1300 + 1150 = 2450 \]

So, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of having the city fix it and the total cost of Ron fixing it himself, then find the difference between these two amounts.

1. The cost of having the city fix the pothole is $450.
2. The cost for Ron to fix it himself includes a fine of $120 and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each.

First, calculate the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself:
- Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
- Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 * $25 = $75

Total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself = $120 + $75 = $195

Now, calculate the savings:
Savings = Cost of city fixing - Cost of Ron fixing
Savings = $450 - $195 = $255

Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

Total chairs left: \(150 + 10 = 160\)

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"Bryce and his four friends ordered a total of 5 pizzas. Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Bryce and two of his friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people (Bryce and two friends) who ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 3 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \right) = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. So, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \times \left( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \right) = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Final numerical answer:
18"
"The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes.

The dog can eat the same number of sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. So, the time it takes for the dog to eat nine sausages is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we add the time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and then divide by 2:
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

"Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( B \) inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be written as:
\[ 9B + 10 \]

We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \) inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of one of Topher's shoes is:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 9B + 10 = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 9B = 90 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:
\[ B = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find out how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows she smashes for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in the students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in the teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the number of windows smashed for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"

   - Total for one week: 300 chairs (weekdays) + 200 chairs (weekends) = 500 chairs

2. Calculate the number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
   - 4 weeks * 500 chairs/week = 2000 chairs

3. Calculate the number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
   - 2 * 2000 chairs = 4000 chairs

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gunther starts with 48 bananas.
2. Arnold steals half of the bananas:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, Gunther is left with:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]
3. The next day, Gunther adds 25 more bananas:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]
4. Arnold steals 12 bananas:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]
5. On the third day, Gunther adds another 6 bananas:
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43 \text{ bananas}
   \]

So, the final number of bananas in the pile is:

"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly share for each roommate.
2. Multiply the monthly share by 12 to find the annual share for each roommate.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly share for each roommate.
The total monthly electricity bill is $100, and there are 5 people (Jenna and her 4 roommates) sharing the bill equally.
\[ \text{Monthly share per person} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Step 2: Calculate the annual share for each roommate.
Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly share by 12.
\[ \text{Annual share per person} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \]

So, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity."
"Jeff initially sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party.

96 - 10 = 86 glasses

6 plates were broken, so the number of plates left is:
48 - 6 = 42 plates

Therefore, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

Final numerical answer:
86 glasses and 42 plates"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for a large button, so 27 small buttons = 27 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 27 large buttons and 3 small stickers left (30 - 27).

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 20 large buttons and 20 large stickers left (40 - 20).

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 60 small buttons and 27 small stickers from the first trade, so she has a total of 87 small buttons (60 + 27).

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 27 large buttons and 87 small buttons.
   - The total number of buttons is 27 + 87 = 114.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, so \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the students:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-large: 15

"First, let's calculate how many people think horse #2 will win:

20% of 50 people = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:

50 people - 10 people = 40 people

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:

60% of 40 people = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, to find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

50 people - 10 people - 24 people = 16 people

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls.
2. If one third of the Pomeranians are girls, then the total number of Pomeranians is 3 times the number of Pomeranian girls. So, the total number of Pomeranians is \(3 \times 6 = 18\).

3. We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If the total number of Pomeranians is 18, then Jana's total number of puppies is \(\frac{3}{2} \times 18 = 27\).

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases of shingles for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles. 

Final numerical answer:

450 + 150 = 600 books

They have read 600 books altogether."
"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5, making her total for Monday \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

Now, we sum up her earnings for both days:
- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30

Total earnings: \(80 + 30 = 110\) dollars.

2. A third of the movies are in series, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
3. The cost for the series is $6 each, so the total cost for the series is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
4. The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
5. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older movies.
6. The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

We know the point system:
- 10 points for each enemy jumped on.
- 5 points for each berry collected.
- 30 points for each second left on the timer when the level is finished.

Let's denote:
- The number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \).
- The number of berries Emma collects as \( B_e \).
- The number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level as \( T_e \).

Then, for Ava:
- The number of enemies Ava jumps on is \( E_e + 8 \).
- The number of berries Ava collects is \( B_e + 3 \).
- The number of seconds left on the timer when Ava finishes the level is \( T_e + 4 \).

Now, let's calculate the scores:

Emma's score:
\[ \text{Score}_e = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e \]

Ava's score:
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 30(T_e + 4) \]

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we have the equation:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( O + W = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \)

First, let's simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( O + W = 17 \)
2. \( O - 2W = 5 \)

We can solve this system using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we'll multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( W \):
\[ 2O + 2W = 34 \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now, add the two equations:
\[ (2O + 2W) + (O - 2W) = 34 + 5 \]
\[ 3O = 39 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

Now substitute \( O = 13 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 13 + W = 17 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

1. One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs:
   \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ smart TVs} \]

2. One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs:
   \[ \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \text{ analog TVs} \]

3. The rest are OLED TVs. To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
   \[ 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25 \text{ OLED TVs} \]

So, Samwell was able to sell 25 OLED TVs."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the trip.
2. Calculate how much the school will contribute.
3. Calculate how much John needs to raise.
4. Subtract the amount John already has from the amount he needs to raise.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The total cost of the trip is $300.
2. The school will cover half of the cost, so the school's contribution is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]
3. The amount John needs to raise is the total cost minus the school's contribution:
   \[
   300 - 150 = 150
   \]
4. John already has $50, so the amount he is still missing is:
   \[
   150 - 50 = 100
   \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"First, let's determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Now, to prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature needs to be at least 32 degrees. Since the temperature drops to 12 degrees during the night, Carson needs to raise the temperature by:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. We do this by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

\[ \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 groups.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups each brought back 2 seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells. We calculate this as follows:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

So, 6 groups each brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells brought back, we multiply the number of these groups by the number of seashells each group brought:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

12"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the changes in the number of people on the train step by step.

1. Initially, there are 172 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 more get on. So, the change in the number of people is -47 + 13 = -34. Therefore, the number of people on the train after the first stop is 172 - 34 = 138.
3. At the next stop, 38 people get off. So, the change in the number of people is -38. Therefore, the number of people on the train after the second stop is 138 - 38 = 100.

The final number of people on the train is 100."

"Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For the additional hours worked, she is paid at a rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate. 

First, let's calculate her special hourly rate for the additional hours:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30 \text{ per hour} \]

On Tuesday, Jamie worked 11 hours. The first 8 hours are paid at her regular rate, and the remaining 3 hours are paid at the special rate.

Now, let's calculate her earnings:
\[ \text{Earnings for the first 8 hours} = 8 \times \$20 = \$160 \]
\[ \text{Earnings for the additional 3 hours} = 3 \times \$30 = \$90 \]

Adding these together gives her total earnings for the day:
\[ \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on Tuesday."
"The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. There are half as many male lions, which means there are 12 / 2 = 6 male lions. Additionally, there are 14 lion cubs.

To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and cubs together:

12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (cubs) = 32 lions

So, there are 32 lions in the enclosure."
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised at 25% off.

To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40:
\[ 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

The sale price of the jeans is $30. If Mike pays with a $50 bill, we subtract the cost of the jeans from the $50 bill to find out how much money he will have left over:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over."
"The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the total number of new hires is:

20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 new employees

The initial workforce is 200 employees, and with the new hires, the total workforce after three months is:

200 initial employees + 60 new employees = 260 employees

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary for all employees is:

260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the total monthly salary by 3:

$1,040,000/month * 3 months = $3,120,000

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

$3,120,000"

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy as \( x \).

The total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\). Therefore, 400 fifth graders had \(400 \times 0.8 = 320\) pass.

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is then:

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

Let the amount of salt used be \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.

According to the problem, the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express all the ingredients in terms of \( z \):
- Citrus zest: \( z \) ounces
- Fragrance: \( z \) ounces
- Salt: \( 2z \) ounces
- Sugar: \( 2z \) ounces
- Oil: \( 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \) ounces

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of all these ingredients, which is 10 ounces:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the week.

Step 1: Total number of tasks per day
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the total number of tasks per day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\).

Step 2: Total number of tasks per week
Since John works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks per week is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\).

Step 3: Total earnings for the week
Each task pays $1.20, so the total earnings for the week are \(1050 \times 1.20 = 1260\).

Therefore, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ points} \]

In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points} \]

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from both games:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]

Total points Sasha scored during both games:

"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tins of cat food.
2. Calculate the total number of tins of dog food.
3. Subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tins of cat food.
Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contained 11 tins.
\[ 8 \text{ packages} \times 11 \text{ tins/package} = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tins of dog food.
Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contained 6 tins.
\[ 6 \text{ packages} \times 6 \text{ tins/package} = 36 \text{ tins} \]

Step 3: Subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food.
\[ 88 \text{ tins} - 36 \text{ tins} = 52 \text{ tins} \]

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we know PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, the number of cards Becca has is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3\) yellow eggs.

To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we add up all the eggs:

\(5\) (green) \(+ 10\) (blue) \(+ 9\) (pink) \(+ 3\) (yellow) \(= 27\)

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund Milly will receive, then subtract the refund from the cost of the book.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - The total shipping cost is the sum of the cost per pound and the cost per mile.
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund Milly will receive:**
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund} = 75\% \times \$32 = 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The net loss is the cost of the book minus the refund, plus the shipping cost.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = \$32 - \$24 + \$3.00 = \$11.00
     \]

Therefore, Milly will lose **$11.00**."
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her $100, so she has:

$40 + $100 = $140

She then buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs:

2 * $30 = $60

And she buys a bag for $20. So the total cost of her purchases is:

$60 + $20 = $80

Subtracting the total cost of her purchases from her total money gives:

$140 - $80 = $60

So, Mulan has $60 left.

"Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: Half of the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
- Third week: Three times the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we need to subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the monthly production:

50,000 (total monthly production) - 8,000 (first week) - 4,000 (second week) - 24,000 (third week) = 14,000 bars

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to add up the time she spends on each activity and then multiply by four.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week, each 4 minutes long.
   - Weekly recording time = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - Monthly recording time = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Weekly writing time = 2 hours = 120 minutes.
   - Monthly writing time = 120 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 480 minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week on makeup.
   - Weekly makeup time = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.
   - Monthly makeup time = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, we add up all the monthly times:
- Total monthly time = 288 minutes (recording) + 480 minutes (writing) + 360 minutes (makeup) = 1128 minutes.

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges:

1. The base installation cost includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, which is $129.00.
2. Angela needs 6 mirrors, which is 2 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for mirrors is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.
3. Angela needs 2 chandeliers, which is 1 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for chandeliers is 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.
4. Angela needs 20 pictures, which is 10 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for pictures is 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

Now, we add all these costs together:

- Base installation cost: $129.00
- Additional cost for mirrors: $30.00
- Additional cost for chandeliers: $15.00
- Additional cost for pictures: $150.00

Total cost = $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $224.00

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in feet, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high (12 inches * 4).
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high (48 inches * 10).

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to cross the highway.

1. First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 3 \times 18 \]
Let's denote the speed of one kangaroo as \(v\). Then:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

2. Now, we need to find out how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same distance. The speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. The time \(T\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is given by:
\[ T = \frac{D}{\text{speed of one turtle} \times 4} = \frac{54v}{\frac{v}{2} \times 4} = \frac{54v}{2v} \times 4 = \frac{54}{2} \times 4 = 27 \times 4 = 108 \]

So, it will take the four turtles 108 hours to cross the highway.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350 in total from her savings, the money from her part-time job, and her mom's contribution.
4. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gives her $80, so the total from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.
5. Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is $350 - $230 = $120.

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is $120."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

So, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow. With 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, he needs:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we first need to determine the annual interest earned and then apply it over the 3-year period.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is $300. So, the interest rate per year is:

\[ \text{Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

This means Brenda earns $225 in interest each year.

Now, we calculate the total interest earned over 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Finally, we add the total interest to the original amount to find the total amount after 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Original Amount} + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975."

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( Y \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( A = Y + 2 \).
3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( A + B + Y + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( Y \) in terms of \( A \):

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
- There are 27 students.
- Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
- Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Step 2: Determine how many packs are required.
- Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
- To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack and round up to the nearest whole number because he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.
- 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.

"The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so the new amount is:

\[ 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is:

\[ 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:

\[ 14000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Let's break it down day by day.

**Day 0:**
- Initially, 10 people are infected.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections = 10 * 6 = 60
- Total infected = 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections = 70 * 6 = 420
- Total infected = 70 (from Day 1) + 420 (new) = 490

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections = 490 * 6 = 2940
- Total infected = 490 (from Day 2) + 2940 (new) = 3430

So, after three days, the total number of people infected is **3430**."
"Rafaela received $20 from each of the forty customers, so the total amount of tips she received is:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, so we need to calculate 10% of $800 and subtract it from $800:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual amounts:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

1520 dollars"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which is 2 * 3 = 6 oranges.

She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

So, the total number of oranges given away is 6 (to daughters) + 3 (to son) = 9 oranges.

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is 12 (initially bought) - 9 (given away) = 3 oranges.

3 oranges"
"Claire earns 1 badge every month. 

In a year, Claire earns:
1 badge/month * 12 months/year = 12 badges/year

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same time Claire earns 1 badge, Amber earns 1/2 badge. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
(1 badge/month / 2) * 12 months/year = 6 badges/year

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in a year, Wendy earns:
3 * 12 badges/year = 36 badges/year

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract Amber's badges from Wendy's badges:
36 badges/year (Wendy) - 6 badges/year (Amber) = 30 badges

Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."

- Leftover burritos = 600 - 520 = 80.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. There are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.
4. The total number of cars is 75.

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52\]

Since the total number of cars is 75, the number of yellow cars is:

\[75 - 52 = 23\]

So, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

From the second equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = A + 25 \]
Substituting \( A = F - 12 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \( 28 \) books.

"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many boxes of jello are required.
3. Calculate the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

Greg wants each of the 30 kids to have 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are required.**

Each box makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes are needed to make 120 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per box:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**

Each box of jello costs $1.25. So, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine the total monthly cost each person pays and then divide that by 4 to find the weekly cost.

1. Calculate Madeline's monthly cost:
   - Madeline pays 60% of the total cost.
   - Total cost = $400
   - Madeline's monthly cost = 60% of $400 = 0.60 * $400 = $240

2. Calculate Keenan's monthly cost:
   - Since the total cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining amount.
   - Keenan's monthly cost = Total cost - Madeline's monthly cost = $400 - $240 = $160

3. Calculate Keenan's weekly cost:

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the chickens.
The selling price per chicken is $50.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Step 3: Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.
Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000.

"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses Mitchell sold.

The total number of glasses sold by Julie and the boys is 32. Subtracting the 14 glasses sold by Julie, we get:

32 - 14 = 18 glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together.

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide 18 by 2 to find out how many glasses each of them sold:

18 / 2 = 9 glasses sold by each of Micah and Mitchell.

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:

14 - 9 = 5

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will make from selling the rope.

The rope is 20 meters long, and she can sell it for $2 per meter. So, the total amount of money she will make is:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, let's determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and we need to know how many meters of the new rope Sarah plans to buy. Since the problem does not specify the length of the new rope, we'll assume she wants to buy a rope of the same length as the one she sold, which is 20 meters.

The cost of the new rope will be:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we can find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope by subtracting the cost of the new rope from the money she made from selling the old rope:

"Let's denote Melanie's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Three times her current age is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be 24 as \( y \). So, we can write the equation:
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

Solving for \( y \):

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12.

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

- Total cost of bacon: $10
- Total cost of chicken: $24
- Total cost of strawberries: $12
- Total cost of apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:

$65 - $60 = $5

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."

2. Next, we find the number of remaining plants after removing the indoor plants:
   \[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

3. Then, we find the number of outdoor plants, which is two-thirds of the remaining plants:
   \[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

4. The rest of the plants are flowering plants. So, we subtract the number of indoor and outdoor plants from the total number of plants:
   \[ \text{Flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

5. Finally, we find the percentage of flowering plants:
   \[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. In the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's.
3. In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's.
4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.

Let's assume Tasha mowed Joe's lawn \(x\) times. Then, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \(3x\) times, and in the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \(5x\) times.

Let's assume Tasha was paid the same amount for each lawn mowing session. Since Joe paid her $6 for her work, we can assume that Tasha was paid $6 for each lawn mowing session.

The total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is:
\[6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x) = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x\]

We know that the total amount Tasha made is $80, and this includes her earnings from mowing lawns and selling lemonade. So, we can write the equation:
\[54x + \text{(lemonade sales)} = 80\]

To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to solve for \(x\). Since the total earnings from mowing lawns is $54x, we can rearrange the equation to find the lemonade sales:
\[\text{(lemonade sales)} = 80 - 54x\]

To find \(x\), we need to know the total earnings from mowing lawns. Since the total earnings are $80 and the earnings from mowing lawns are $54x, we can set up the equation:
\[54x = 80 - \text{(lemonade sales)}\]

Since the total earnings are $80 and the earnings from mowing lawns are $54x, we can solve for \(x\) by assuming the simplest case where the earnings from mowing lawns are maximized. If \(x = 1\), then:
\[54(1) = 54\]
So, the earnings from mowing lawns are $54, and the earnings from lemonade sales are:
\[80 - 54 = 26\]

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[\boxed{26}\]"
"Martin's weight is 55 kg.

Carl’s weight is 16 kg more than Martin’s weight, so Carl’s weight is 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg.

Christian’s weight is 8 kg more than Carl’s weight, so Christian’s weight is 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg.

Harry is 5 kg less than Christian’s weight, so Harry’s weight is 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"To calculate John's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out each month.
2. Calculate his total earnings from renting the car.
3. Subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit.

Step 1: Total number of hours rented out each month
John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time.
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Step 2: Total earnings from renting the car
John gets paid $25 an hour.
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Step 3: Calculate the profit
John's car payment is $500.
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting his car is:
\[ \$250 \]"
"Martha originally had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's number of notebooks from Martha's:

7 - 6 = 1

Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"Dijana rowed for 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed an additional \( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \) miles.

Let's calculate that additional distance:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance both of them rowed, we add Dijana's and Anis's distances:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:
110 miles."
"Susan originally made 100 cookies. Her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself, leaving 100 - 4 = 96 cookies.

Now, these 96 cookies are to be equally divided among her 6 nephews.

So, each nephew will get 96 / 6 = 16 cookies.

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel did not read any pages today, so his total remains 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total:

28 (Denise's total) - 13 (Daniel's total) = 15 pages.

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children.

Each child's bowl is half the size of an adult's bowl, so 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls (since 2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls).

Calvin has 8 child bowls in total, and after the adults have their bowls, there are 4 child bowls left.

Since there are 2 children, we divide the leftover 4 child bowls by 2 children:

4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 child bowls per child

So, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch."
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50.

The cost of the notebooks is:
5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50

The cost of the ballpen is:

The total amount William spent is:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

He spent a total of $8.00."
"To find out how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask separately and then add them together.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- To make 1 small mask, she would need \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- To make 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- To make 1 large mask, she would need \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- To make 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets purchased.

First, we know there are 9 movies and Deepa has seen each one 3 times. So, the total number of times she saw the movies is:
\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ times} \]

Next, we know she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:
\[ \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} = 8 \text{ dollars per ticket} \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is:
\[ 8 \]
The average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours. He also walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

To find out how much free time he has left in his day, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on these activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day (24 hours).

Total hours spent on activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walk dog: 1 hour

Total hours spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

Total hours in a day = 24 hours

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total hours spent on activities
Free time = 24 - 19 = 5 hours

Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes.

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes, so the number of red shoe boxes used is:
1/3 * 9 = 3 red shoe boxes.

Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes.

So, the final answer is:
4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes are left in Tim's box."
"Sarah has 9 books.

Then, he gives 10 marbles to Donald:
24 - 10 = 14 marbles

Therefore, Dean is left with 14 marbles."
"Duncan's current age is 60. Eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as \( A \). According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 52 = 2A \]

Solving for \( A \):

\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

So, Adam was 26 years old four years ago. Therefore, Adam's current age is:

\[ 26 + 4 = 30 \]

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Together, the two farms have 200 + 500 = 700 acres.

"Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, which means he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. So, for 40 packages, he earns 40 * $0.20 = $8 per hour.

In an eight-hour workday, he would earn 8 * $8 = $64.

Therefore, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how long it takes John to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle.
   - A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes.
   - An extreme sudoku puzzle takes 4 times that long, so:
     \[
     45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. Next, we need to figure out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes, given that he drinks a bottle every half hour.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 180 minutes, there are:
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Since he drinks a bottle every half hour, in 3 hours, he drinks:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour}}{30 \text{ minutes/bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes him to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle.

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.

The equation representing the total number of pieces of bologna can be written as:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Subtract 40 from both sides to solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons would be:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each would cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl was given:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14."

"To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Total number of lollipops sold = Number of students × Average lollipops sold per student
   = 30 students × 10 lollipops/student
   = 300 lollipops

2. Total revenue from selling the lollipops = Total number of lollipops sold × Selling price per lollypop
   = 300 lollipops × $0.8/lollypop
   = $240

3. Total cost of buying the lollipops = Total number of lollipops sold × Buying price per lollypop
   = 300 lollipops × $0.5/lollypop
   = $150

4. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   = $240 - $150
   = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Calculate the number of berries picked per trip.

First, we know that it takes the sloth 4 hours to make one trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up. Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick per trip to collect a total of 24 berries in 2 trips. We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of berries per trip} \times 2 \text{ trips} = 24 \text{ berries} \]

Solving for the number of berries per trip:

\[ \text{Number of berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The pool has 10,000 gallons of water, and they fill the tank with half of that amount:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, after 6 days, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank."

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
3. Calculate the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Calculate the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, the mini cinnamon roll has:
   \[
   \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, the mini blueberry muffin has:
   \[
   \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:
   \[
   200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:
   \[
   300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories}
   \]

5. Adding the total calories from both types of pastries gives:
   \[

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed over the week:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

First, add 39 and 78:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]

Next, add 78:
\[117 + 78 = 195\]

Then, add 48:
\[195 + 48 = 243\]

Finally, add 57:
\[243 + 57 = 300\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[\frac{300}{5} = 60\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
The total number of toys is 62.

Let's add up the known quantities:

31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of toys:

62 (total toys) - 48 (known toys) = 14

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and the boxes they already have:

- 10 people donate 5 boxes each: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes
- They already have 10 boxes

So, the total number of boxes is \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes, given that each table can fit 2 boxes:

- Total boxes: 60
- Boxes per table: 2

So, the number of tables needed is \(60 \div 2 = 30\) tables.

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is:

- Total tables needed: 30
- Tables they already have: 15

Therefore, the number of new tables needed is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Final numerical answer:
15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then find the average of these two totals.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds: 40
- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey: \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney: \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Now, we find the average of these two totals:
- Total distance spat by both: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet
- Average total distance spat: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for 17 hours.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for 24 hours:
- The cost for 24 hours is 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the first 12 hours and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour:
- The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays for 17 hours, so he needs to add 70 pesos for each of the 5 additional hours (17 - 12 = 5).
- The cost for the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for 17 hours is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's find out how much Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- The cost for 24 hours is 1600 pesos.
- The cost for 17 hours is 1350 pesos.
- The savings would be 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is 10 pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

For the 15 goats, Nate needs 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay.

For the 12 sheep, Nate needs 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay.

In total, Nate needs 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay.

159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week:

John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract that amount as well:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he wants to buy 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens is:
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \]

"Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

20 words * 15 letters/word = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

300 letters + 50 letters = 350 letters

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig and his brother have spelled:

300 letters + 350 letters = 650 letters

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 650."
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

2. There are 7 rows for each of the 5 different schools.

So, the total number of children in one school is:
\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ children} \]

Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of children in the drill is:
\[ 56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons:

Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, and the teacher has 9 coupons. So, the total number of bottles from coupons is:
\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles the teacher has for herself:
\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for the job, we need to add the visit charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

1. Visit charge: $40
2. Labor charge: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). So, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. Parts charge: $60

Now, we add these charges together:

$40 (visit) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205

The total charge for the job is $205."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, let's apply the 40% discount:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

$150 - $60 = $90

Next, James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

Since he sold these CDs, he recovers that amount of money. Now, let's calculate how much money he was out after selling 5 CDs:

$90 (total cost after discount) - $200 (money recovered from selling 5 CDs) = -$110

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $110, not that he was out any money. However, the question asks how much money he was out, which in this context would be interpreted as the initial outlay before selling the CDs. Therefore, the amount of money he was out initially is:

$90

Final numerical answer:
$90"
"To find out how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

1. Earnings from yams:
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam is sold for $1.5.
   - Total earnings from yams = 6 * $1.5 = $9.

2. Earnings from sweet potatoes:
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato is sold for $2.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = 10 * $2 = $20.

3. Earnings from carrots:
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots = 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, we sum up the earnings from all the root crops:
- Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots
- Total earnings = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn $34."

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (the total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

We can use the second equation to express \( A \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]

And the third equation to express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions for \( A \) and \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."

"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Multiply the number of 15-minute intervals by the number of reports Vince can staple in each interval.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert 15 hours into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before sleepwalking:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - From 6 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 55 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep:**
   - Total time asleep = usual sleep duration - time awake before sleepwalking - time sleepwalking
   - Total time asleep = \(480 - 55 - 23 = 402\) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 402 minutes that day."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Number of unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200.
   - New admissions = 700.
   - Total occupied beds = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds = 900.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family, so the number of emails to family is:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

The other emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend, so the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

(1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

1 email/day"
"If Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of balls Jeffrey carried be \( J \).
2. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls each boy carried:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's first calculate the total number of holes dug and filled in by the end of the third day.

- First day: 10 holes dug
- Second day: 13 holes dug
- Third day: 8 holes dug, but 2 holes were filled in

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 8 (third day) = 31 holes

The number of holes filled in by the end of the third day is 2.

Therefore, the net number of holes by the end of the third day is:
31 (total dug) - 2 (filled in) = 29 holes

The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes dug. So, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is:
4 * 10 = 40 holes

Since there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
40 (total by the end of the fourth day) - 29 (total by the end of the third day) = 11 holes

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the supplies.
2. Calculate the cost of the travel tickets, which is 50% more than the cost of the supplies.
3. Add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the travel tickets to get the total travel cost.

Let's start with the cost of the supplies, which is $400.

Next, we calculate the cost of the travel tickets. Since the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to find 50% of $400 and add it to $400.

50% of $400 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the travel tickets to get the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the total travel cost is:

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation above:
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]

\text{Total Southward Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_3 = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]

The total distance flown northward is the second distance:
\[
\text{Total Northward Distance} = \text{Distance}_2 = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the difference between the total southward distance and the total northward distance:
\[
\text{Net Distance} = \text{Total Southward Distance} - \text{Total Northward Distance} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374 \, \text{miles}}

"Greta initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

When she arrived home, she had 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

So, before the surprise party, Greta had a total of:
12 (initial batch) + 6 (office party) + 48 (surprise party) = 66 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Therefore, the number of brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
66 (total brownies) - 18 (brownies eaten) = 48 brownies.

Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice his age, so his brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, her age is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   \(3 \text{ racquets} \times 15 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 45 \text{ minutes}\)

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Now, we add up the total time:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all of the racquets."
"John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
2 * $600 = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the last 2 phones is:
2 * $300 = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the last 2 phones together, the total cost is:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid $1800 for all the phones."
"Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Carlton's team to the number of players on Zeke's team:

13 + 20 = 33

There are 33 players in both teams combined."
"To calculate the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to determine the perimeter of the rectangular fence.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. 

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of boxes she kept in terms of the total is:
8 boxes * 1/4 = 2 boxes

This means she sold the rest of the boxes, which is:
8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be represented as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books.

The cost of the dictionary is $18.
The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14, so we need to find out how much more money he needs to buy the books:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford the books.

"Robert has 30 cherries, which is 10 more than Richard. So, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

The total number of cherries is 60. If we subtract the cherries that Richard and Robert have, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has.

So, Jerry has 60 - 30 (Robert's cherries) - 20 (Richard's cherries) = 10 cherries.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

30 (Robert's cherries) - 10 (Jerry's cherries) = 20

Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"Let's break down the sales for each day and then calculate the total earnings.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 10 boxes
- Apple pie sold: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie sold: 15 boxes

**Costs:**
- Gingerbread: $6 per box
- Apple pie: $15 per box

**Calculating earnings for each day:**

**Saturday earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
- Apple pie: 6 boxes * $15 = $90
- Total for Saturday: $60 + $90 = $150

**Sunday earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
- Apple pie: 15 boxes * $15 = $225
- Total for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

**Total earnings for two days:**
- Saturday + Sunday = $150 + $315 = $465

"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

First, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price:
40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
$100 - $40 = $60

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
$100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160

Both cars cost a total of $160."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old when Emil is 24, so his dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old when Emil is 24, so his brother is currently \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which is 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, which is 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:

20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

The total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days is \(3 + 12 + 6 = 21\) pounds.

If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, then the number of servings Joe has is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) servings.

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after removing the football players:

30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can calculate this as:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find out how many students are leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, 12 students are leaving early today."
"If Sophie wears size 5 boots, then Charlie's boots are five times that size, which would be:

5 * 5 = 25

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed and then calculate the cost of the additional plants she needs to buy.

First, let's convert the width of each plant and the space between plants to feet for consistency. Since 12 inches is equal to 1 foot, each plant takes up 1 foot of space, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant.

The total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:
\[ 1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant and the space between it and the next plant take up:
\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:
\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:
\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Pat will spend:
\[ \boxed{162} \]"

"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost of the petunias for one basket:
- Each basket has 3 petunias.
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Therefore, the cost for petunias in one basket is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines for one basket:
- Each basket has 2 sweet potato vines.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
- Therefore, the cost for sweet potato vines in one basket is \(2 \times 2.50 = 5\) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost for one basket by adding the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines:
- The total cost for one basket is \(9 + 5 = 14\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost for all 5 baskets:
- The total cost for 5 baskets is \(5 \times 14 = 70\) dollars.

Therefore, Katherine will spend \(\boxed{70}\) dollars filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then subtract that from the total amount of soil they have.

1. Calculate the soil needed for the sunflowers:
   - Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 4 sunflowers.
   - Total soil for sunflowers = 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds.

2. Calculate the soil needed for the carnations:
   - Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 10 carnations.
   - Total soil for carnations = 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds.

3. Calculate the total soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
   - Total soil used = 12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds.

4. Calculate the remaining soil for planting roses:
   - Total soil available = 30 pounds.
   - Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds.

5. Calculate the number of roses that can be planted:
   - Each rose needs 1 pound of soil.
   - Number of roses = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses.

"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

$500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5

Since she can't buy half a pair of shoes, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means she can buy 0 pairs of shoes each month with her current savings.

Now, we need to calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year. Since she can't buy any pairs of shoes each month, the total number of pairs she can buy in a year is:

0 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 0 pairs/year

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for each task:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Cooling from low setting: \(+6\) degrees
- Cooling from high setting: \(+12\) degrees
- Warming up: \(-4\) degrees

Net change in temperature:
\[ 6 + 12 - 4 = 14 \text{ degrees} \]

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet.

First, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the Comet for the second time. Since Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30, and the Comet orbits every 75 years, the second time he saw it would be 75 years later. So, Bill's dad was:

\[ 30 + 75 = 105 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we know that Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet for the first time. So, Bill was:

\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old} \]

Since Bill saw the Comet a second time at 90 years old, and it takes 75 years for the Comet to orbit the sun, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90:

\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. Electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Church: 2 checks per month
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check every quarter (4 checks per year)

Now, let's calculate the total:

- Electric bill: 12 checks per year (1 check/month * 12 months)
- Gas bill: 12 checks per year (1 check/month * 12 months)
- Church: 24 checks per year (2 checks/month * 12 months)
- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (1 check/quarter * 4 quarters)

Total checks per year = 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks

Therefore, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips each day. These 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips each day.

2. Out of these 88 trips, three-quarters of the flights are to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66\).

3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\). Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\).

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."

- Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
- The total cost of the trousers is $30.

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to add the amounts given by his mother and father and then subtract this total from the cost of the trousers.

So, the total amount given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.

Now, subtract this from the cost of the trousers: \(30 - 18 = 12\).

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A = 3 \) (Akbar's age)
- \( B = 4 \) (Alessandro's age)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
- Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, let's find the average age of the group. The average age is given by:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

Since Helene's age is twice the average age, we have:
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( B \):
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} \]
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4} \]
\[ H = \frac{14 + 2H + 2W}{4} \]
\[ 4H = 14 + 2H + 2W \]
\[ 2H = 14 + 2W \]
\[ H = 7 + W \]

Now, we use the total age equation:
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We already have \( H = 7 + W \), so substituting this into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 7 + W + W = 13 \]
\[ 7 + 2W = 13 \]
\[ 2W = 6 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

So, the age of Wilfred is \( \boxed{3} \)."
"Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund, which totals:

Walter's friend then gives him $200, so the total amount collected before the lawyer's contribution is:

$2000 + $200 = $2200

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else donated $2200, the lawyer's contribution will be:

100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door:

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church next door by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

Therefore, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \), so the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100\% = 25\%

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the nine hours he has available.

1. Time spent on inpatient rounds:
   - He has 9 inpatients.
   - Each inpatient check takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for inpatient rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. Time spent on appointments:
   - He has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

3. Convert the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to hours:
   - Total time for inpatient rounds = 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.
   - Total time for appointments = 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

4. Calculate the total time spent on all activities:
   - Total time spent = 3 hours (inpatient rounds) + 5 hours (appointments) = 8 hours.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes (or 3 hours).

Now, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

Let's start with the cost per session for the studio:
- The studio rental cost per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session for the studio is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is \(480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we can set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars, so \( 4p = 64 \).
- Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars, so \( 7m = 56 \).

First, we solve for \( p \) and \( m \):

\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} \]
\[ p = 16 \]

\[ 7m = 56 \]
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} \]
\[ m = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:

\[ p - m = 16 - 8 \]
\[ p - m = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
4. Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population. The total population is 50, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the number of baby porcupines born each month is:
   \[
   \text{Number of baby porcupines per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

3. To find the number of baby porcupines born in a year, we multiply the number of baby porcupines born each month by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
   \[
   \text{Number of baby porcupines in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

4. Finally, we add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population:
   \[
   \text{Final population} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

So, the number of porcupines in the park after a year is 1490."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the final cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

So, they have a total of 34 sticks.

"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed: 55 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed: 45 miles per hour
- Time: 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo:
- Difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

230 miles"
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

4. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

5. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is **1875**."
"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps in one hour.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(14 / 2 = 7\) laps in one hour.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps in one hour.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\(10 - 5 = 5\)

Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled:**
   - Total water filled in two days = \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

4. **Water Remaining:**

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501678 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501678} \approx 0.558 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 55.8%. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{55.8\%} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times (\$10/\text{hour} + \$15/\text{hour}) = 40 \times \$25 = \$1000 \text{ per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.**

The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of that amount for a down payment. So, the down payment amount is:
\[ 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.**

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{\$2000}{\$1000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the fruits he has bought:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. 

**Final Answer: 3**"
"Anne purchased a box of sweets containing 15 packs, with each pack having 60 pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of sweets in the box:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each of the 13 packs contains 60 pieces, so the total number of sweets given to her friends is:
\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since she gave these sweets equally to her 10 friends, the number of sweets each friend received is:
\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this case is the formula for compound growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24:
   100 - 24 = 76 guests.
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15:
   76 - 15 = 61 guests.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   2 * 15 = 30 guests.
5. After the afternoon check-ins, the number of guests increases by 30:
   61 + 30 = 91 guests.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner was served, so the number of guests increases by 7:
   91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The final number of guests in the hotel is 98."

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) because she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (2x \times S) + (x \times L) \]
Given that the total earnings are $120, we can substitute the values of \( S \) and \( L \) into the equation:
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals."

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50

2. For the second package:
   - 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"First, we need to determine the remaining amount Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set. 

The cost of the new bedroom set is $3000, and he sells his old one for $1000. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:

$3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining $2000 each month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst:

- Sally started with 25 red balloons.
- 40% of the red balloons burst, so \( 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \) red balloons burst.
- Therefore, \( 25 - 10 = 15 \) red balloons remained.

Next, let's calculate the number of yellow balloons that were released:

- Sally started with 12 yellow balloons.
- She released half of them, so \( 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \) yellow balloons were released.
- Therefore, \( 12 - 6 = 6 \) yellow balloons remained.

Now, let's consider the blue balloons:

- Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree.
- She added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, so \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) blue balloons were added.
- Therefore, she added 6 blue balloons to her remaining clutch.

Now, let's sum up the total number of balloons she carried into the school:

- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7 (unchanged)
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons carried into the school:

   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher for a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8

Now, we calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by considering the scenarios where he does not get an extension:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability = 50% or 0.5

- **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
  - Probability = 50% * 60% = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3 or 30%

- **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Does Not Get a Personal Extension:**
  - Probability = 50% * 60% * 80% = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24 or 24%

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 = 1.04 \]

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, we need to consider the overlap and correct for it. The correct way to calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is to find the complement of the probability that he does not have to turn it in.

The probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the scenarios where he does not have to:

\[ 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 = 1.04 \]

Since the total probability cannot exceed 1, we need to correct for the overlap. The correct probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:

\[ 1 - (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 - 0.5 \times 0.6 - 0.5 \times 0.8 - 0.6 \times 0.8 + 0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8) \]

Simplifying the expression:

\[ 1 - (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 - 0.3 - 0.4 - 0.48 + 0.24) = 1 - 0.24 = 0.76 \]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[ 76\% \]

**Final Answer: 76%**"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty.
2. Subtract this number from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for guests.
3. Divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the math:

1. Total seats for graduates and faculty: 950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250 seats
2. Available seats for guests: 6000 (total capacity) - 1250 (allocated seats) = 4750 seats
3. Tickets per graduate: 4750 (available seats) / 950 (number of graduates) = 5 tickets

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.
2. Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans. So, the number of medium-sized jelly beans he can eat is \(2 \times 75 = 150\).
3. Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean. Therefore, to find out how many small jelly beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized jelly beans, we multiply 150 by 3.

So, the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \(150 \times 3 = 450\).

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it takes to place all the bottles and drop the candy.

First, let's find out how many soda bottles Richard will place. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he places a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of bottles is:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ bottles}
\]

The ""+1"" is because we need to count the bottle at the starting point.

Next, we need to calculate the total time it takes to place all the bottles and drop the candy. Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, and there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is:

\[
8 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds per interval} = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

\[
\boxed{40}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total amount of money he would have earned if he had continued working, and then determine how long it would take him to earn the equivalent of the loans and lost income.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had continued working:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - He would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount earned = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned with a college degree:**
   - With a college degree, his income is tripled, so his new annual income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.
   - He would have earned $75,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount earned with a degree = $75,000 * 4 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college:**
   - Total amount earned if not going to college = $100,000.

5. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned with a college degree compared to not going to college:**
   - Total amount earned with a degree = $300,000.
   - Total amount earned if not going to college = $100,000.
   - Difference in earnings = $300,000 - $100,000 = $200,000.

6. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the lost income:**
   - Total amount borrowed = $200,000.
   - Total amount of lost income = $100,000.
   - Total amount needed = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

7. **Calculate how long it would take Jim to earn the equivalent of the loans and lost income:**
   - Jim's new annual income with a degree is $75,000.
   - Time needed = Total amount needed / Annual income = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the required fabric pieces.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of each fabric piece will be:

Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:

Area of one piece = Length × Width
Area of one piece = 8 feet × 10 feet
Area of one piece = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:

Total area = 2 × 80 square feet
Total area = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

2. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. So, we first calculate one-fifth of Monday's deliveries:
   \[
   \frac{425}{5} = 85
   \]
   Then, we add 17 to this number:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. First, we calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this number:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209
   \]
   So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

4. Now, we sum up the deliveries from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
   \[
   425 + 102 + 209 = 736

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost and won:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net loss: $21.5 - $11 = $10.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:

\[
\text{Average loss per race} = \frac{\text{Total loss}}{\text{Number of races}} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5
\]

So, the average loss per race is $3.5.

\[
\boxed{3.5}

3. Calculate the total population of South America: 26 countries * 5000 people/country = 130,000 people.

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given information, is 130,000 people."
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Xavier's initial height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420.

"To calculate the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team.
3. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
- There are 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days.
- So, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team.
- The painters worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.
- There are 24 hours in a day.
- So, the number of hours worked per day by the team is \(\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9\) hours.
- Over 21 days, the total hours worked by the team is \(21 \times 9 = 189\) hours.

Step 3: Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.
- There are 4 painters.
- So, the hours each painter worked is \(\frac{189}{4} = 47.25\) hours.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:

\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

\[
2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[
2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} + 2 \cdot 4 = 2 \cdot 19
\]

\[
4x + x + 8 = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, Rory retrieved \(\boxed{10}\) tennis balls in the first set of the match."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:

\[ \text{Value after depreciation} = \text{Initial value} \times (1 - \text{depreciation rate})^{\text{number of years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."

"To calculate the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to determine how many tiles you will need and then multiply that by the cost per tile.

1. **Determine the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, you will need \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200\) tiles.

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

**Final Answer:**
The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new tiles will be $2400."
"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%. 

To find the increased amount, we calculate 60% of $120:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 (months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet per week. 

- For the twin beds: 4 sheets per bed * 4 beds = 16 twin sheets per week.
- For the king bed: 1 king sheet per week.

Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time, we can calculate the number of loads per week:

- Twin sheets: 16 sheets / 2 sheets per load = 8 loads per week.
- King sheets: 1 sheet / 1 sheet per load = 1 load per week.

So, the total number of loads per week is 8 (twin) + 1 (king) = 9 loads.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is:

9 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 468 loads/year.

"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous collection) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means:
2 * 50 (collected last year) = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by Imma's cats in one day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the daily consumption of cat food for one cat:
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams twice a day.
   - So, one cat consumes \(60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

2. Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption for all the cats is:
   - \(120 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
   - \(720 \, \text{grams} \div 360 \, \text{grams/day} = 2 \, \text{days}\).

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices. 

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add up the slices each person ate:
\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, let's break down each charge:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge would be half of $300, which is $150.
3. **Painkillers**: $4/pill for 30 pills, which is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. **Parking**: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, which is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add all these charges together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to find out how many emails James doesn't need to respond to each day. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, we calculate 20% of 80 emails:

20% of 80 = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails

So, James doesn't need to respond to 16 emails each day. This means he needs to respond to the remaining emails:

80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

James responds to 64 emails each day. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\]

\[= 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\]

\[= 247\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all tests and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are:
- 100 on the first test
- 100 on the second test
- 100 on the third test
- 80 on the fourth test

Total score = 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Number of tests = 4

Average score = Total score / Number of tests
Average score = 380 / 4
Average score = 95

The final numerical answer is:
95"
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate:

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]

So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas. This means they have:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]
pizzas left.

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate:

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
pizzas. They ate 80% of them:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the football team ate 32 pizzas. This means they have:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]
pizzas left.

Finally, to find the total number of pizzas left, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total number of pizzas left is:
14"
"Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. 

First, let's calculate the number of big coupons:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
\[ 700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:
\[ 1400 \times 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we add the costs together to find the total cost:
\[ 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Anthony spends a total of:
\[ 245 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
2. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.
3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches remaining.
4. Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches in total.

Now, we need to find out how many meatballs are in the 6 meatball sub sandwiches that remained.

- Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs.
- 6 sub sandwiches * 4 meatballs per sub sandwich = 24 meatballs.

So, the final numerical answer is:

24"
"Mr. Hezekiah initially had 20 trucks, and each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver their load. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Since each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons} \]

**Final Answer: 300 tons**"
"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants, so he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets a second pound at half the price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. So, for the first pound, he pays $4.00, and for the second pound, he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Therefore, for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since he needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

6 pounds of butter / 2 pounds per set = 3 sets

3 sets * $6.00 per set = $18.00

The total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $18.00."
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the actual number of guests attending the party is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Adding the rental fee and the cost for the additional guests gives us the total cost:

$125 + $126 = $251

The party will cost $251."
"Let's start by calculating how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80.

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money they each have left:

Maggie has $60 left, and Riza also has $60 left.

To find the total amount of money they have left together, we add their remaining amounts:

\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Therefore, the two of them have $120 left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a week.
2. Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week.
3. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Now, let's calculate the daily banana consumption for each monkey:

- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
- Let's denote the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day as \(x\).

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[10 + 14 + x = 24 + x\]

Since this is the number of bananas eaten in one day, the total number of bananas eaten in a week (7 days) is:
\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]
\[24 + x = \frac{315}{7}\]
\[24 + x = 45\]
\[x = 45 - 24\]
\[x = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

Final answer:
21"
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed all 500 pieces of that puzzle.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is:

250 (from the first puzzle) + 500 (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces.

750 pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we can determine the cost of a single rose by dividing $15 by 12:

\[ \text{Cost of one rose} = \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \]

Now, we can find the cost of 15 roses by multiplying the cost of one rose by 15:

\[ \text{Cost of 15 roses} = 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change she should receive is the difference between the amount she brought and the cost of the roses:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters."
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price and then add all the amounts together.

1. Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.00
2. Burger platters: 9 platters * $11 each = $99.00
3. Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.00

Now, we add all the amounts together:

$33.00 (milkshakes) + $99.00 (burger platters) + $30.00 (sodas) = $162.00

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul boards the fourth train and the time he arrives at the station.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 minutes arrival + 20 minutes stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for 1/4 of the first train's stay time, which is 5 minutes (20 minutes / 4).
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 minutes arrival + 5 minutes stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at time 0, he will wait 145 minutes for his train.

**Final Answer:**

"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. Therefore, the number of toothpicks she still needs to collect is:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take her 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, which is $2000.

The price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, the selling price to his friend is:
\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and the friend paid $1800 for it. The discount amount is:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, one spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

72,000"
"Frankie's score was 15 better than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score was 90.

Twice Binkie's score is \(2 \times 90 = 180\).

Frankie's score is 15 more than this, so Frankie's score is \(180 + 15 = 195\).

Frankie's score: 195"
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, another 2 miles. So, he walked a total of 4 miles.

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

It took him 1 hour to reach the store."
"To calculate how much money Jenny saved, we need to compare the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas versus buying 40 individual bananas (since each bunch averages 4 bananas and she bought 10 bunches).

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.

\[ \text{Cost of 10 bunches} = 10 \times 3.00 = 30.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 individual bananas:
- Each individual banana costs $0.80.
- Jenny would need 40 bananas.

\[ \text{Cost of 40 individual bananas} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:

\[ \text{Money saved} = \text{Cost of 40 individual bananas} - \text{Cost of 10 bunches} \]
\[ \text{Money saved} = 32.00 - 30.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( S + H = 100 \)
2. \( H = S + 60 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine the growth rate per year and then apply it to the 13-year period.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, the growth rate per year is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the annual growth rate by 13:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of bike sold:

1. Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes:
   \[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ Trekking bikes} \]

2. 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes:
   \[ 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \text{ BMX bikes} \]

3. The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes. Since we know the number of Trekking and BMX bikes, we can find the number of MTB bikes by subtracting these from the total:
   \[ 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \text{ MTB bikes} \]

Now, let's calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

1. Earnings from Trekking bikes:
   \[ 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \]

2. Earnings from BMX bikes:
   \[ 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \] (since a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $500, so $500 / 2 = $250)

3. Earnings from MTB bikes:
   \[ 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \]

Finally, let's sum up the earnings from all the bikes:
\[ 67,500 + 11,250 + 52,500 = 131,250 \]

Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. Over 6 hours, the farmer makes:

\[ 5 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{bales} \]

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. Over 6 hours, the truck picks up:

\[ 3 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 18 \, \text{bales} \]

To find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:

\[ 30 \, \text{bales} - 18 \, \text{bales} = 12 \, \text{bales} \]

So, at the end of the 6-hour day, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

Total class time per day = 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total class time for the week is:

Total class time per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on these days.

Extra learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week * (1/16) = 100 minutes/week

Now, we add the class time and the extra learning time to get the total learning time per week:

Total learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week + 100 minutes/week = 1700 minutes/week

To convert the total learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total learning time per week in hours = 1700 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 28.3333 hours/week

Therefore, John spends approximately 28.33 hours a week learning."
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, after the first bounce, the height will be:
\[ 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

After the second bounce, the height will be:
\[ 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 10.67 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\frac{32}{3}\) feet.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\frac{32}{3} \text{ feet}
\]"
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial weight of the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:

\[160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon:

\[\frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

Finally, we calculate the cost. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:

\[12 \times 12 = 144\]

So, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"Let's break down the scenario step by step:

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
2. She shakes 3 of them.
3. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas.
4. Her brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and picks a soda at random. There are 9 sodas left, and 2 of them are shaken.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second train is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour. 

To find out how far apart they are after 3 hours, we calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

270 miles"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps based on his working hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

- Billy takes 20% of the days off, so he works 80% of the days.
- Number of days Billy works = 50 days * 80% = 50 * 0.8 = 40 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.**

- Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- Number of people he helps per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
- Total number of people he helps = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people.

"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people that the buses could carry is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people that the cars could carry is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people that the buses and cars could carry to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:
480"
"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha's age is \(24 - 4 = 20\) years old.
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff's age is \(20 + 10 = 30\) years old.

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time for the biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time for the second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. 

First, let's calculate the total time for breaks and lunch per day:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Break 1: 15 minutes
- Break 2: 15 minutes

Total time per day = 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby's breaks and lunch add up to 1 hour per day.

After 5 days, the total time is:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

Final numerical answer:
5"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Amber ran 8 miles.
2. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran \(3.5 \times 8 = 28\) miles.
3. Together, Amber and Micah ran \(8 + 28 = 36\) miles.
4. Since the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles, Ahito must have run \(52 - 36 = 16\) miles.

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract that from the initial charge:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is:
   \[
   20.00 \times (1 - 0.20) = 20.00 \times 0.80 = 16.00
   \]
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is:
   \[
   30.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = 30.00 \times 0.90 = 27.00
   \]
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00
   \]

The new balance on her credit card is:
\[
\boxed{113.00}

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"If Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, then Ben is:

\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Since Caroline is three times older than Ben, Caroline is:

\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   - She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.

2. Calculate the total amount of money needed for 20 years of retirement:
   - Total amount needed = $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:
   - She saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   - 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

4. Calculate the number of years needed to save $800,000:
   - Number of years = Total amount needed / Annual savings = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Since Lauren is currently saving for a retirement period of 20 years, we need to find out how many more years she needs to work to save for the full 40 years of retirement.

5. Calculate the additional years needed:
   - Additional years needed = 40 years - 20 years = 20 years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 20 more years to save for a retirement period of 20 years, living on 40% of her current annual salary."
"Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut it into 4 equal parts first, and then each of those parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts.

First, we find the length of each of the 4 equal parts:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

Next, we take each of these 25 cm parts and divide them into 5 equal parts:
\[ \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total school population, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total school population by \( P \).

Given that 40% of \( P \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"To find out how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the garden soil, and then subtract the coupon amount.

Cost of pots: $19

"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Next, we add these totals together to get the overall total height of the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Now, we divide this total by the number of women to find the average height of the heels:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \] inches.

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in the month of June, Soledad needs to determine how many miles she must hike per day.

First, we need to know the number of days in June, which is 30 days.

Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total distance she plans to cover each day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/walk} \times 2 \text{ walks/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles she needs to hike per day to cover 9,300 miles in 30 days. We do this by dividing the total distance by the number of days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 310 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we subtract the distance she plans to hike from the distance she needs to hike:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

60 miles/day"

The store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples.

Peter wants a quarter of that, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of that, so:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Peter and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, James will have:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

James will have 5 kilograms of apples left."

50 (last year's enrollment) + 10 (increase) = 60

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

Given:
- 255 blinks in 5 minutes

We need to find the time \( t \) for 459 blinks.

First, we find the rate of blinks per minute:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, we use this rate to find the time for 459 blinks:
\[ t = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

\[ t = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times."

"Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so Dior took 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 hours (since ""over 4 hours longer"" means at least 5 hours, but we can use 9 as a clear example of ""well over"").

Adding up the time for all chores:
Amalia: 4 hours
Megan: 6 hours
Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"John visits his parents twice a month, and each visit takes 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph. Since it's a round trip, we need to calculate the distance for one trip and then double it.

First, we calculate the distance for one way:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since it's a round trip, we double the one-way distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:
\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days. Therefore, Brian will walk half the distance Sofie walks in 7 days:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ toys per hour} \]
Over 10 hours, they produce:
\[ 12 \times 10 = 120 \text{ toys} \]

The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ toys per hour} \]
Over 10 hours, they produce:
\[ 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Adding the toys produced by the first four workers:
\[ 120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys, which means the first four workers have produced:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

So, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, and Kory's dog is 60 pounds. So, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many stickers Seth had initially.

1. Let's say Seth had \( x \) stickers initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{x}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) stickers. This means Luis gave the rest to Kris, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) stickers.
4. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. So, Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total.
5. Since Kris received \( \frac{x}{4} \) stickers from Luis, we can set up the equation: \( \frac{x}{4} = 16 \).
6. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies each day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the distance by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \( A \), by Madeline as \( M \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know:
- Arnold painted 13 eggs.
- Camden painted 21 eggs.

To find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be put into a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together, we get:

\[ 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be made into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree:

\[ 80\% \times 80 \text{ feet} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother earns $5000 * 2 = $10000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (brother) = $15000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns $15000 * 2 = $30000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (brother) + $30000 (mother) = $45000.

Total amount of money they all have together: $45000."
"Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and the beach portion of the trail is 2 miles, we can determine her speed on the beach. 

Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, we can write the equation:
\[ 2 = v \times 40 \]
\[ v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed, so her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

The sidewalk portion of the trail is 1 mile. To find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to get the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."
"Jane has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks, so she has saved a total of:

She wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks needed to save $28 is:

\[ \frac{28}{4} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. For the 3 trees each with 7 blue birds:
   \(3 \times 7 = 21\) blue birds

2. For the 2 trees each with 4 blue birds:
   \(2 \times 4 = 8\) blue birds

3. For the 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
   \(1 \times 3 = 3\) blue birds

Now, we add all these together:
\(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob originally has. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, he had:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

2. Next, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. If he starts with 36 marbles and loses 10, he will have:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would allow Donny to drink the mixture after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees for him to drink it.

The total volume of the mixture is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces. The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs of water:

\[
\text{Temperature of the mixture} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Now, let's solve for \( T \):

\[
4 \times 33 + T \geq 40 \times 5
\]

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

\[
T \geq 200 - 132
\]

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug of water must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the mixture.

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks.
- So, the total number of cows added is \(20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows}\).

Now, let's calculate the number of chickens added:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks.
- So, the total number of chickens added is \(10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens}\).

Next, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Total number of cows after three weeks: \(50 + 420 = 470\)
- Total number of chickens after three weeks: \(20 + 210 = 230\)

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
- Total number of animals: \(470 + 230 = 700\)

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

Now, let's apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, let's find out how many bagels Russell gets in 4 packs:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels/pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, to find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

Each single bagel will cost:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the information given:
   - If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then \(x\) potatoes make 18 scoops.
   - We can write the proportion as \(\frac{3}{2} = \frac{x}{18}\).

4. Solving for \(x\):
   - Cross-multiply to get \(3 \times 18 = 2 \times x\).
   - This simplifies to \(54 = 2x\).
   - Dividing both sides by 2 gives \(x = 27\).

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats in those 60 days.

1. For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
   \(3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}\)

2. For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
   \(5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}\)

3. Adding the eggs from both periods:
   \(90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}\)

4. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
   \(\frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}\)

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans. Since there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Step 3: The number of blue jellybeans is the total number of jellybeans minus the total number of green and red jellybeans:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Tim grows 5 trees. Each year, he collects 6 lemons from each tree. 

In one year, the total number of lemons he collects is:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, which is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[14x = 84\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 14:

\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of men and women on the bus:

- Number of men = 5x = 5 * 6 = 30
- Number of women = 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales.
2. Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day from the bouquet sales.
3. Calculate the number of sunflowers in each bouquet.
4. Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets per day.
5. Sum the total number of sunflowers sold from both the individual sunflowers and the bouquets per day.
6. Multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3 to get the total for 3 days.

Let's start with step 1:
- Faraday earns $26 per day from selling individual sunflowers.
- Each sunflower costs $2.
- Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

For step 2:
- Faraday earns $56 per day from selling bouquets.
- Each bouquet costs $8.
- Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.

For step 3:
- Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.

For step 4:
- The number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.

For step 5:
- The total number of sunflowers sold per day is 13 sunflowers (from individual sales) + 84 sunflowers (from bouquets) = 97 sunflowers.

For step 6:
- The total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is 97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers.

Therefore, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is 291."
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with $100 if each rock costs $5.

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5 \text{ per rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells, which is 60% of his inventory.

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each.

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times \$7 = \$84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. The loss is the difference between his initial investment and the revenue.

\[ \text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16."
"To find out how many days it will take for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scenes and then sum them up.

For large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for large-sized scenes = 45 / 5 = 9 days.

For medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for medium-sized scenes = 36 / 6 = 6 days.

For small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for small-sized scenes = 49 / 7 = 7 days.

Now, we sum up the days required for each size:
- Total days = 9 (large) + 6 (medium) + 7 (small) = 22 days.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Distance for the first part of the trip: 110 miles
- Distance for the second part of the trip: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Time for the first part of the trip: 2 hours
- Time for the second part of the trip: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning with the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is:
\[ 0.20 \times 3 = 0.60 \]

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressing this as a percentage:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells.
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected \(22 / 2 = 11\) seashells.

Now, let's find the total number of seashells they collected:

- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

"Mason eats 4 carrots each on the weekdays (Monday to Friday), which is 5 days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:

5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Adding the carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend gives us the total number of carrots he eats in a week:

20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price, which means he sells each device for $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
\[ \text{Profit per device} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Buying price} = \$40 - \$20 = \$20 \]

Next, we calculate the total profit from selling the devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday:
- He bought 2 devices on Monday, so the profit from Monday's devices is:
\[ 2 \times \$20 = \$40 \]
- He bought 4 devices on Tuesday, so the profit from Tuesday's devices is:
\[ 4 \times \$20 = \$80 \]

Now, we add the profits from both days to get the total profit:

"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they would need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total required:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Carla has 8 identical octuplets.
2. 3/4 of them are dressed in purple, and 1/4 in blue.

First, calculate the number of octuplets dressed in each color:
- Purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we know that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. So, calculate the number of octuplets wearing bows:
- Blue-wearers wearing bows: 2 (all blue-wearers)
- Purple-wearers wearing bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

Now, the total number of octuplets wearing bows is:
- Total wearing bows: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)

We need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The number of purple-wearers wearing bows is 2, and the total number of bow-wearers is 4. So, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sells half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left.
4. He then sells another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. One quarter of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. After selling 10 square meters, he has 30 square meters left.
6. He then sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earns 30 * $3 = $90 from the remaining land.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $170 after selling all his unused land."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits. So, \(x = 1000\). This means an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
6. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.
7. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, let's sum up the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second piece of information, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

Then, using the first piece of information, we can express \( R \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28 \]

Now, we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y + Y + Y - 28 - 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."

3. After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money, so we can write the equation:
   \[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

4. Simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[ 15 - x = 12 \]

5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

6. Now, we know that both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. So, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
   \[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know the mural used 12 pints of paint in total.
2. Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]
3. The remaining paint is used for red, white, and purple. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can denote the amount of each as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is:
   \[
   3x
   \]
4. The total amount of paint used is the sum of the yellow paint and the red, white, and purple paint:
   \[
   6 + 3x = 12
   \]
5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   3x = 12 - 6
   \]
   \[
   3x = 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

So, the amount of red paint used is \( 2 \) pints.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The dimensions of each bedroom are 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds from Monday, which is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.

On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.

On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.

On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

To find the total number of clouds she counted across all five days, we add the number of clouds from each day:

\(3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\)

At the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \).
   - Therefore, the special box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special box:**
   - The special box costs $12 and contains 120 pods.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods you can get for $1:**
   - If each pod costs $0.10, then for $1, you can get \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Calculate the number of dishwashing cycles you can run with 10 pods:**
   - Since you use 1 pod per cycle, 10 pods will allow you to run 10 cycles.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he withdraws is:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, the number of bills he uses is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   The amount he pays is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]

4. He then triples his money. The amount of money he has is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Tripling this amount gives:
   \[
   400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals = 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after using 45% of the 5-inch piece on Monday, and then calculate how many days he can use 20% of the remaining chalk before it falls below 2 inches.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk.
   - He used 45% of it on Monday.
   - 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.
   - Remaining chalk = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

2. **Determine the chalk usage per day:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day.
   - 20% of the remaining 2.75 inches = 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day.

3. **Calculate the number of days before the chalk is recycled:**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to go from 2.75 inches to less than 2 inches.
   - The chalk decreases by 0.55 inches each day.
   - The chalk will be less than 2 inches when the remaining chalk is 2 inches or less.
   - The chalk will be 2 inches after (2.75 - 2) / 0.55 = 0.75 / 0.55 ≈ 1.36 days.
   - Since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, we round up to the next whole day, which is 2 days.

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to determine how many girls and boys are on varsity.

- One-third of the girls are on varsity: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) girls.
- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) boys.

Now, we can calculate the number of students not on varsity:

- Girls not on varsity: \( 12 - 4 = 8 \)
- Boys not on varsity: \( 12 - 3 = 9 \)

Adding these together gives us the total number of students not on varsity:

- Total students not on varsity: \( 8 + 9 = 17 \)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James has 30 teeth.
2. The dentist drills 4 of them.
3. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Now, we need to find out how many teeth the dentist has fixed in total. The dentist has fixed the teeth by drilling and capping, so the total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist has fixed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the dentist has fixed 50% of James' teeth.

\[ \text{Amount of milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. The refund is based on the cost per gallon, which is $3.5.

\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old."
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

First, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. So, we can find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000 by dividing $27000 by $500:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Since each set is 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400
\]

Now, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since he distributes the money equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, for 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten will be:
- Cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Now, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many cheese pizza pies are needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pie: \(36 \text{ slices} \div 12 \text{ slices per pie} = 3 \text{ pies}\)

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many pepperoni pizza pies are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pie: \(24 \text{ slices} \div 8 \text{ slices per pie} = 3 \text{ pies}\)

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of:
- 3 cheese pizza pies
- 3 pepperoni pizza pies

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs Built Per Hour**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs Melted Per 15 Minutes**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

3. **Net Snowballs Built Per Hour**: The net number of snowballs Jay builds in an hour is the number he builds minus the number that melt, which is \(20 - 8 = 12\).

4. **Snowballs Needed**: Jay needs 60 snowballs.

5. **Time Calculation**: To find out how many hours it will take to build 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net number of snowballs built per hour. So, \(60 \div 12 = 5\) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age when Digimon came out, given that John is currently 28 years old and was twice as old as Jim at that time.

1. Let's denote the number of years since Digimon came out as \( x \).
2. John's age when Digimon came out would be \( 28 - x \).
3. Jim's age when Digimon came out would be \( \frac{28 - x}{2} \).

Since we don't know the exact year Digimon came out, we can use the information that John is currently 28 to find out how old Jim was at that time. We don't need to know the exact year, just the relationship between their ages.

Given that John is currently 28 and was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can set up the equation:

\[ 28 - x = 2 \left( \frac{28 - x}{2} \right) \]

This equation is inherently true, so we can use the fact that John is 28 now to find Jim's current age. Since John is 28 and was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can find Jim's age at that time by dividing John's current age by 2:

\[ \text{Jim's age when Digimon came out} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Since Jim was 14 when Digimon came out and it's been 20 years since then, we can find Jim's current age by adding 20 years to his age at that time:

\[ \text{Jim's current age} = 14 + 20 = 34 \]

So, Jim is currently 34 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages they had at the end of the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Initial bandages} + 50 - 38 = \text{Initial bandages} + 12
   \]

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used:
   \[
   38 - 10 = 28 \text{ bandages}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of bandages they had at the end of the second day is:
   \[
   (\text{Initial bandages} + 12) - 28 = \text{Initial bandages} - 16
   \]

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they received:
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ bandages}
   \]
   They also used half a pack, which is:
   \[
   \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ bandages}
   \]
   So, the number of bandages they had at the end of the third day is:
   \[
   (\text{Initial bandages} - 16) + 100 - 25 = \text{Initial bandages} + 69
   \]
   We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Initial bandages} + 69 = 78
   \]
   Solving for the initial number of bandages, we get:
   \[
   \text{Initial bandages} = 78 - 69 = 9

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**

Since there are 4 weeks in April and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.**

For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's find the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, which means he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is 8 gallons, which will be shared equally among the 3 people.

To find out how much each person gets, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people:

8 gallons / 3 people = 8/3 gallons per person

"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
2. Calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes to get the final answer.

Let's start with step 1:

1. One-third of the fish have red stripes. So, the number of fish with red stripes is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]

2. Now, we subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish to find the remaining fish:
   \[
   66 - 22 = 44
   \]

3. Next, we calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we have:
   \[
   \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
   \]

4. Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:
   \[
   22 + 20 = 42
   \]

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, she had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so she loses 4 colors. Now she has \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which means she uses up \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. So, she loses 3 more colors.

Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors she has left is \(22 - 3 = 19\).

Final numerical answer:

"Mattison is 60 inches tall.

His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the height of the house is:
\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so the height of the first floor is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches high, the height from the first floor to the second floor (which is the same as the height of the second floor) is:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the roof is 240 inches from the second floor's floor.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells, which is:
\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \text{ shells} \]

Therefore, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is the remaining shells after the other two teams have found theirs:
\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \text{ shells} \]

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles needed per day for all the dogs.

The total miles needed for all 4 dogs is the average miles per day (3 miles) multiplied by the number of dogs (4):

\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

We know the first three dogs need to walk 1 mile, 4 miles, and 3 miles respectively. So, we can add those up and subtract from the total to find out how many miles the last dog needs:

\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of the value of his house:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts by taking 60% of the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the loan amount to find out how much money he has leftover:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

So, the total weight of the tunas is:
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, if a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram:

128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the buying price from it.

1. Calculate the selling price:
   - Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the buying price.
   - Buying price = $72.
   - Selling price = \( 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \).

2. Perform the multiplication:
   - \( 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \).

3. Calculate the profit:
   - Profit = Selling price - Buying price.
   - Profit = $99 - $72 = $27.

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."

"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The original amount borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:

\[ 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:

\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base with side lengths of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume \( V \) of the jar is given by:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bus has a capacity of 200 people.
2. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
3. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[20 + 40 = 60\]
4. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again. So, the number of people who entered at the second stop is:

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The longer piece, being 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers: 82
Number of sick teachers: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Teachers at school = 69 + 9
Teachers at school = 78

So, 78 teachers were at school that day."
"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of Pasta:**
   - Bud uses 1 box of pasta per week.
   - The cost of one box of pasta is $1.00.
   - Therefore, the weekly cost of pasta is $1.00.

2. **Cost of Cheddar Cheese:**
   - Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese per week.

3. **Cost of Gruyere Cheese:**
   - Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.
   - Therefore, the cost of gruyere cheese per week is \(2 \times 3 = $6.00\).

4. **Total Weekly Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs for one week:
     \[
     \text{Total weekly cost} = \text{Cost of pasta} + \text{Cost of cheddar cheese} + \text{Cost of gruyere cheese}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total weekly cost} = 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00
     \]

5. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so there are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Therefore, the total annual cost is:
     \[
     \text{Total annual cost} = \text{Total weekly cost} \times 52
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total annual cost} = 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00
     \]

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time in minutes for the 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Time per classroom = 15 minutes
Number of classrooms = 80

Total time required = 15 minutes/classroom * 80 classrooms = 1200 minutes

**Step 2: Determine the total available time in minutes for the 5 days.**

An 8-hour day = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day
Number of days = 5

Total available time = 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

Total time required = 1200 minutes
Number of days = 5

Average time spent cleaning per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

Average time spent cleaning per day = 240 minutes
Total available time per day = 480 minutes

Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%

The final numerical answer is:

50%"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that can be held by one bookcase:

- Middle shelves: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: \(20\) books
- Top shelf: \(15\) books

Total books per bookcase: \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. So, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

Rose will sell the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, five dozens will have:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs, we divide 60 by 3:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rose's profit is:

"Skyler has 100 hats in total.

Half of the hats are red, so:
\[ \text{Red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

After removing the red hats, the remaining hats are:
\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \]

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so:
\[ \text{Blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

The rest of the hats are white, so:
\[ \text{White hats} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"Archie buys beef jerky that comes 30 sticks to a bag and costs $18.00 per bag. With a $3.00 discount, the bag now costs $15.00.

To find the cost per stick in cents, we first calculate the cost per stick in dollars and then convert it to cents.

Cost per stick in dollars = Total cost of the bag / Number of sticks
Cost per stick in dollars = $15.00 / 30
Cost per stick in dollars = $0.50

Now, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):
Cost per stick in cents = $0.50 * 100
Cost per stick in cents = 50 cents

The final numerical answer is:
50 cents"
"First, let's calculate how many questions Audrey got right on the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct:

\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test.

Next, we need to find out the total number of questions she needs to get correct to pass. She needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly. The total number of questions on both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct:

\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]

Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total to pass. Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:

"Brianna's family has 4 people, so they have 4 flashlights (one for each person).

There are 8 rooms in the house, and for each room, there are 2 flashlights. So, the total number of flashlights for the rooms is:
8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights

In total, they have:
4 (personal flashlights) + 16 (room flashlights) = 20 flashlights

For the candles, half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. So, the number of small candles is:
4 rooms * 4 small candles/room = 16 small candles

And the number of medium candles is:
4 rooms * 5 medium candles/room = 20 medium candles

In total, they have:
16 (small candles) + 20 (medium candles) = 36 candles

So, when the lights go out, Brianna's family is using:

"John takes 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube. 

The second and third sides each take twice that long, so:
- Second side: 5 minutes * 2 = 10 minutes
- Third side: 5 minutes * 2 = 10 minutes

The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first side, so:
- Fourth side: 5 minutes / 2 = 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 5 minutes / 2 = 2.5 minutes

The sixth side is not specified, but since all 6 sides are needed to solve the Rubik's cube, we can assume it takes the same time as the first side, which is 5 minutes.

Adding all these times together:
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 5 = 35 minutes

The Rubik's cube takes 35 minutes."
"Given that there were 20 helmets, and Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets, we can calculate the number of robots as follows:

Number of robots = 20 / 2 = 10

Also, Dominick saw half as many helmets as footballs, so we can calculate the number of footballs as follows:

Number of footballs = 20 * 2 = 40

Now, to find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes Tim spends at work answering phones each day.
2. Determine how many calls he can handle in that time.
3. Multiply the number of calls he handles in one day by the number of workdays in a week.

Step 1: Convert the hours spent at work into minutes.
Tim spends 6 hours each day at work. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of calls he can handle in one day.
It takes him 15 minutes to deal with one call. So, the number of calls he can handle in one day is:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of calls he handles in a 5-day work week.

"To return home, Phineas Frog will need to cover a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and he has trained to be 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speaking speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. There are 10 pages, and each page has 450 words.

\[ \text{Total words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New speaking speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw on these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:

"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** 3 times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** 4 times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** Half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the number of kernels that popped during the cooking process:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[\frac{40}{4} = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

2. Orange candies: Twice the amount of red candies, so \(2 \times 54 = 108\)
3. Yellow candies: Half as many as red candies, so \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\)

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[54 + 108 + 27 = 189\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[232 - 189 = 43\]

So, the number of pink candies is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately, and then add them together.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost for one night at the hotel is $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

2. **Bus Travel Cost:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The cost of one bus trip is \(80 \times 0.10 = 8\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the bus trips is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for the hotel and bus travels is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus travel cost.
   - Total cost = Hotel cost + Bus travel cost = \(240 + 56 = 296\) dollars.

Therefore, Helen paid a total of **296 dollars** for the hotel and bus travels during that trip."
"Mazie originally had 52 marbles. Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, which means Dallas originally received \(21 + 4 = 25\) marbles from Mazie.

"To find the total cost, let's break it down step by step:

1. The cost of an adult ticket is $12. Since there are 2 parents, the total cost for the adult tickets is:
   \[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

2. The cost of a child ticket is $8. Since there is 1 child, the total cost for the child ticket is:
   \[ 1 \times 8 = 8 \]

3. The cost of 2 popcorns at $3 each is:
   \[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

4. Adding all these costs together gives the total amount they pay:
   \[ 24 + 8 + 6 = 38 \]

So, the total amount they pay is $38."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, the total weight of the children is 75 pounds * 2 = 150 pounds.

So, the total weight is:
1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + 150 pounds (children) = 1600 pounds.

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
1600 pounds * 0.01 = 16 pounds.

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."
"To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily feed consumption for one pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   Dexter has five pigs, so:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 280 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

4. **Determine the amount of feed left after a week:**
   Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so:

1. Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed:
   - John invited 20 people.
   - Each guest will eat 2 hot dogs.
   - Total hot dogs needed = 20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs.

2. Calculate the number of hot dogs he already has:
   - He has 4 hot dogs left over.

3. Calculate the number of additional hot dogs he needs to buy:
   - Additional hot dogs needed = Total hot dogs needed - Hot dogs already available
   - Additional hot dogs needed = 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

4. Calculate the number of packs of hot dogs he needs to buy:
   - Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
   - Number of packs needed = Additional hot dogs needed / Hot dogs per pack
   - Number of packs needed = 36 / 6 = 6 packs.

5. Calculate the total cost:
   - Each pack costs $2.
   - Total cost = Number of packs needed * Cost per pack
   - Total cost = 6 packs * $2/pack = $12.

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."
"First, let's calculate the total money Frances makes from selling cupcakes and cookies:

- She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so the total from cupcakes is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dollars.
- She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so the total from cookies is \(40 \times 1 = 40\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total money made is \(40 + 40 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the trays she buys:

- She buys five trays at $4 each, so the total cost is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many holes Nate can fill in one day. Since he fills 9 holes a day and the dog digs 6 holes a day, the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes for Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days into weeks:

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the average enrollment at Butler High School.
2. Subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

First, we know that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:

"Let's break down the information given:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} = 29 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 8 + 16 + 7 - x = 29 \]

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

First, we need to find out how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{\text{Distance Vanessa ran}}{2} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know Aaron's speed. Since Aaron completed 2 miles in 16 minutes, his speed is:

\[ \text{Speed of Aaron} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:

\[ \text{Speed of Vanessa} = 2 \times \text{Speed of Aaron} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we can calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:

\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}}} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 4 \text{ minutes/mile} = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line needed.
Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total amount of line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.
The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, so the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the weekly earnings, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. Number of reservations per night: 6
2. Meals per reservation: 2
3. Cost per meal: $5
4. Cost of wine per reservation: $5
5. Number of days the restaurant is open per week: 2

First, calculate the total cost per reservation:
- Cost of meals per reservation: 2 meals * $5 = $10
- Cost of wine per reservation: $5
- Total cost per reservation: $10 + $5 = $15

Next, calculate the total cost for all reservations per night:
- Total cost per night: 6 reservations * $15 = $90

Finally, calculate the total cost for the week:
- Total cost per week: $90 * 2 days = $180

So, the restaurant makes $180 a week if they are open 2 days a week."
"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost price per watermelon.
2. Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost price per watermelon.**

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.**

A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price. So, the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, then she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is currently 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

**8**"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

1. Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

2. Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

3. Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
   - The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

5 more oranges."
"To find out how much Mark paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor, then add these two amounts together.

1. Calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount:
   - Original cost of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80%
   - Discounted cost: $400 * (1 - 0.80) = $400 * 0.20 = $80

2. Calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor:
   - Labor rate: $50 per hour
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: $50 * 3 = $150

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of radiator + Labor cost
   - Total cost = $80 + $150 = $230

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230."
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. Each chicken has 2 legs.
2. Each cow has 4 legs.
3. The total number of animals is 20.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can set up the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm.

Final numerical answer:
5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices.
2. Divide the total number of slices by the number of people.

First, we calculate the total number of slices:
7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry and his 3 friends, so 4 people in total):
56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

Each person can have 14 slices."
