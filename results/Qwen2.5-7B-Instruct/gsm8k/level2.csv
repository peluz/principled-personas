"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Janet has each day, which is 16 eggs.

Next, we account for the eggs Janet uses:
- She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
- She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used each day is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we find out how many eggs are left to sell at the farmers' market:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Since Janet sells each egg for $2, the total amount of money she makes from selling the remaining eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is:
\[
\boxed{18}

"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we start by identifying the amount of each type of fiber required.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The amount of white fiber required is half the amount of blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

Next, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts needed:
\[
2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
\]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Purchase price} + \text{Repair cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

2. **Determine the new value of the house after the repairs:**
   The value of the house increased by 150%. To find the new value, we first calculate 150% of the total cost and then add it to the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{New value of the house} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Increase in value} = 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   Profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{New value of the house} - \text{Total cost} = 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000
   \]

Thus, Josh's profit is \(\boxed{195000}\)."
"To determine the total number of meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total distance James runs in one session.
2. Multiply that by the number of sessions he has in a week.

First, we know that James runs 3 sprints in each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the distance he runs in one session is:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, we know that James runs 3 times a week. So, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of meters James runs in a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily feed requirement for the flock:**
   - Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day.
   - Wendi has 20 chickens.
   - Therefore, the total daily feed requirement is:
     \[
     3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:**
   - In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
   - In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
   - The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
     \[
     15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:**
   - The total daily feed requirement is 60 cups.
   - The amount of feed already given is 40 cups.
   - Therefore, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
     \[
     60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
     \]

Thus, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the first glass} = \$5 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the second glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the second glass} = 0.60 \times \$5 = \$3 \]

This pattern continues, with every first glass costing $5 and every second glass costing $3. Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can break this down into 8 pairs of glasses.

The cost for one pair (one $5 glass and one $3 glass) is:
\[ \$5 + \$3 = \$8 \]

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times \$8 = \$64 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we start by defining the number of sheep each city has in terms of the number of sheep Seattle has.

1. Let the number of sheep Seattle has be denoted by \( S \).
   \[
   S = 20
   \]

2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, the number of sheep Charleston has, denoted by \( C \), is:
   \[
   C = 4 \times S = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, the number of sheep Toulouse has, denoted by \( T \), is:
   \[
   T = 2 \times C = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. To find the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we sum the number of sheep each city has:
   \[
   T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into several steps and calculate the time for each step.

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.4 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Add the time for the Windows update restart:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.6 \times 200 = 120 \text{ GB}\).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Sum up all the times:**

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then subtract the distance he has covered from the initial distance to his home.

1. **Initial Distance to Home:**
   John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   \[
   \text{Initial distance} = 3 \, \text{hours} \times 60 \, \text{mph} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Distance Traveled After Turning Around:**
   - **First 2 hours in standstill traffic:** No distance covered.
   - **Next 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph:**
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 0.5 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{mph} = 15 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - **Remaining time:**
     \[
     4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}
     \]
     - **Driving at 80 mph for 1.5 hours:**
       \[
       \text{Distance} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \times 80 \, \text{mph} = 120 \, \text{miles}
       \]

3. **Total Distance Traveled After Turning Around:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance to home: 180 miles
   - Distance traveled after turning around: 135 miles
   \[
   \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, at the end of those 4 hours, John is \(\boxed{45}\) miles from home."
"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours worked.

1. **Calculate the regular pay for the first 40 hours:**
   - Regular hourly rate: $10
   - Regular hours worked: 40
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. **Calculate the overtime pay for the additional hours:**
   - Overtime rate: 1.2 times the regular hourly rate
   - Overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12/hour
   - Overtime hours worked: 45 total hours - 40 regular hours = 5 hours
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. **Calculate the total earnings for the week:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are **$460**."
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we will calculate the downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The program had 60 downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the first month} = 60
   \]

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month. First, we calculate 30% of the second month's downloads:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of 180} = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   Then, we subtract this from the second month's downloads to find the third month's downloads:
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   We sum the downloads from all three months:
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[
\boxed{366}
\]"
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry separately and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen donuts is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times 68 \).

\[
3 \times 68 = 204
\]

2. **Cost of Mini Cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen mini cupcakes is $80.

\]

3. **Cost of Mini Cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen mini cheesecakes is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \( 6 \times 55 \).

\[
6 \times 55 = 330
\]

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Sum the costs of all the pastries.
   - Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes.

\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

Thus, the total cost is \(\boxed{694}\)."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost:**
   - The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.

2. **Annual Costs:**
   - The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

3. **Annual Revenue:**
   - Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons.
   - Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
   - Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

4. **Net Annual Profit:**
   - The net annual profit is the annual revenue minus the annual cost.
   - Net annual profit = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

5. **Break-Even Point:**
   - We need to find the number of years \(n\) such that the total net profit equals or exceeds the initial cost.
   - The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\).
   - We set up the equation: \(7.5n \geq 90\).

6. **Solve for \(n\):**
   \[
   7.5n \geq 90
   \]
   \[
   n \geq \frac{90}{7.5}
   \]
   \[
   n \geq 12
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos at least 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house.

2. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Vacuum cleaners sold to the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

4. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

5. **Vacuum cleaners left:**
   According to the problem, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

6. **Solve the equation:**
   First, eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's determine the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find out how many students are left after accounting for those who enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. So, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we determine how many students are left to enroll in hip-hop dance. This is the remaining number of students after accounting for those in contemporary and jazz dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Calculation:**
   - Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: \( 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125 \)

2. **Electronic Gadgets Calculation:**
   - Initial value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: \( 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096 \)

Now, we compare the final values:
- Final value of jewelry: $5125
- Final value of electronic gadgets: $8096

The electronic gadgets will yield a higher value at the end of the month. The profit from the electronic gadgets is the final value minus the initial value:
\[ 8096 - 8000 = 96 \]

Therefore, the profit from choosing the electronic gadgets is $96."

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to break down her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- There are 50 weeks in her working year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- There are 50 weeks in her working year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we add her annual earnings from both jobs to find her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Determine the number of days in 4 weeks.
3. Calculate the total number of eggs consumed in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

**Step 1: Number of eggs per day**
Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. So, she eats 3 eggs per day.

**Step 2: Number of days in 4 weeks**
There are 7 days in a week. Therefore, in 4 weeks, there are:
\[ 4 \times 7 = 28 \text{ days} \]

**Step 3: Total number of eggs in 4 weeks**
Since she eats 3 eggs each day, in 28 days, she will eat:
\[ 3 \times 28 = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

**Step 4: Convert eggs to dozens**
There are 12 eggs in a dozen. So, the number of dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks is:
\[ \frac{84}{12} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to hike the 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the time already spent hiking:**
   Marissa has already spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and another hour on the next 2 miles, so:
   \[
   \text{Time already spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining time to hike the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time already spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining distance to hike:**
   The total distance is 12 miles, and she has already hiked 6 miles, so:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of \(\boxed{6}\) miles per hour."

   - Total water = \(6 + 9 = 15\) liters.

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is \(\boxed{15}\) liters."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Samantha's age when Raymond was born:**
   - Samantha is currently 31 years old.
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
   - Therefore, when Raymond was born, Samantha was \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

2. **Determine Raymond's age when he had his son:**
   - Raymond had his son at the age of 23.

3. **Calculate the year Raymond had his son:**
   - Since we know Samantha was 25 when Raymond was born, and Raymond was 23 when he had his son, we need to find out how many years after Raymond was born this happened.
   - The difference in age between when Raymond was born and when he had his son is \(23 - 0 = 23\) years (since we are considering the age at which he had his son, not the age difference from birth).

4. **Determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born:**
   - Since Samantha is currently 31 and she was 25 when Raymond was born, the time from when Raymond was born to now is \(31 - 25 = 6\) years.
   - Adding the 23 years it took for Raymond to have his son, the total time from when Raymond was born to when his son was born is \(6 + 23 = 29\) years.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 29 years ago. 

**Final Answer:**

1. Calculate the total time the candle burns.
2. Determine how much the candle melts in that time.

First, let's find the total time the candle burns. The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The time difference between these two times is:
\[ 5:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. Therefore, in 4 hours, the candle will melt:
\[ 2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm} \]

So, the candle will be \(\boxed{8}\) centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price. This is because a 25% discount means Kyle paid 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price.

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can express this relationship with the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, we perform the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \(\boxed{26}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the boxes of pizza.

1. **Cost of the chicken meal:**
   \[
   1 \times 12 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the milk:**
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of the apples:**
   \[
   4 \times 1.50 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
\[
12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ dollars}
\]

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[
50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the total amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[
\frac{17}{8.50} = 2
\]

Thus, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza."
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
\[
\text{Total cost of shorts} = 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
\[
\text{Total cost of pants} = 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50
\]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
\[
\text{Total cost of shoes} = 3 \times 42 = 126
\]

Now, we sum the total costs of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of shorts} + \text{Total cost of pants} + \text{Total cost of shoes}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 49.50 + 67.50 + 126
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
49.50 + 67.50 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 126 = 243
\]

Thus, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is:
\[
\boxed{243}
\]"
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia eats in 60 days:**
   - Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night.
   - There are 60 days in the given period.
   \[
   \text{Total servings} = 1 \text{ serving/night} \times 60 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ servings}
   \]

2. **Determine how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia needs:**
   - Each carton contains 15 servings.
   \[
   \text{Number of cartons} = \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the ice cream:**
   - Each carton costs $4.00.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total distance of the trip: 60 miles.
2. Determine the distance traveled before the first stop: 20 miles.
3. Determine the distance remaining after the first stop: \(60 - 20 = 40\) miles.
4. Identify the distance of the second stop, which is 15 miles before the end of the trip: \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles from the start.
5. Calculate the distance traveled between the first and second stops by subtracting the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop: \(45 - 20 = 25\) miles.

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the cost of the other pair of high heels is twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[
33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars}
\]

The problem states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
99 = B - 5
\]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[
B = 99 + 5 = 104
\]

Thus, the cost of the boots is:
\[
\boxed{104}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell's and Allen's current ages. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age. Since Allen's age is \(11x\):

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the guesses from each friend.
2. Calculate the average of these guesses.

First, let's denote the guesses:
- The first friend's guess is 80.
- The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. So, we calculate half of 80 and then add 20:
  \[
  \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
  \]
- The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. So, we calculate 25% of 80 and then add it to 80:
  \[
  \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
  \]

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Calculate the daily time spent on each dog:
   Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.

2. Calculate the total daily time spent on all dogs:
   John has 10 dogs, so the total daily time is:
   \[
   10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. Calculate the weekly time spent on all dogs:
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly time is:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"Let's define the number of silver coins Gretchen has as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins, so we can express the number of gold coins as \( S + 30 \).

The total number of coins is the sum of the silver coins and the gold coins, which is given as 110. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( S \). We do this by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins, we calculate the number of gold coins as:
\[ S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of jewels Aaron has:**
   - Raymond has 40 jewels.
   - Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   - First, calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
     \[
     \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]
   - Then, add 5 to this amount to find the number of jewels Aaron has:
     \[
     20 + 5 = 25
     \]
   - Therefore, Aaron has 25 jewels.

2. **Determine the number of jewels Siobhan has:**
   - Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   - Subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
     \[
     25 - 2 = 23
     \]
   - Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"First, we determine how many points Mike scores in the second 20 minutes. We know he scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes than in the first 20 minutes. 

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. To find 25% more than 4 points, we calculate 25% of 4:
\[
0.25 \times 4 = 1
\]

Adding this to the original 4 points gives:
\[
4 + 1 = 5
\]

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 5 points.

Next, we add the points scored in both halves of the game to find the total points:
\[
4 + 5 = 9
\]

Thus, the total number of points Mike scored is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This can be calculated by dividing 60 by 4:

\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets at $15 each:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the money he has left equals the money he got from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by adding the cost of the video games and the remaining money:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \]

Since the money he got from selling the lego sets is $195, and he spent $165, we can check the remaining money:

\[ 195 - 165 = 30 \]

However, the problem states he has $5 left, which means there was no discrepancy in the initial calculation. The question asks how many lego sets he still has, but since he sold all 13 lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, John's running speed is \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours given the specified time allocations for running and walking.

1. **Determine the skipping speed and its relation to running speed:**
   - Dana's skipping speed is given as 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping speed is half the running speed.
   - Let \( R \) be the running speed.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{R}{2} = 3 \) miles per hour.
   - Solving for \( R \):
     \[
     R = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine the walking speed:**
   - Dana's walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed.
   - Let \( W \) be the walking speed.
   - Therefore, \( W = \frac{R}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \).

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time available is 6 hours.
   - She spends one-third of the time running:
     \[
     \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - She spends two-thirds of the time walking:
     \[
     \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running = Speed running \(\times\) Time running
   - Distance running = \( 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \)

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking = Speed walking \(\times\) Time walking
   - Distance walking = \( 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \)

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking
   - Total distance = \( 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \)

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]"

   - Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Determine the age of Brandon's iPhone:**
   - Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the throwing distance with the sapphire gemstone:**
   - Polly's normal throwing distance without the gemstone is 400 feet.
   - With the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.
   - Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
     \[
     400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the safe distance outside the dragon's reach:**
   - The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet.
   - To ensure the javelin hits the dragon, Polly must stand at least 1200 feet away from the dragon.
   - The safe distance outside the dragon's reach is the difference between the throwing distance and the dragon's reach:
     \[
     1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, Polly could stand \(\boxed{200}\) feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the initial number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of calories in the entire 300g bag of chips. Since the bag has 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day after you have already consumed 1800 calories out of your daily target of 2000 calories:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of the bag of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since the entire 300g bag contains 1250 calories, the number of grams you can eat per calorie is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat with 200 calories is:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:

"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

**Monday:**
Meredith wrote 5 articles.

**Tuesday:**
She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote:
\[ 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles} \]

**Wednesday:**
She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at the coffee shop.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before using any at work is the sum of the initial notes and the notes from the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes remaining is:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 \]

According to the problem, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:
\[
\boxed{800}

"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

The wire is 4 feet long, so in inches, it is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of units in the building:**
   - The building has 15 floors.
   - Each floor contains 8 units.
   - Therefore, the total number of units is:
     \[
     15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of occupied units:**
   - 3/4 of the building is occupied.
   - Therefore, the number of occupied units is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = \frac{3 \times 120}{4} = \frac{360}{4} = 90 \text{ units}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied units:**
   - The total number of units is 120.
   - The number of occupied units is 90.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied units is:

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. We subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many toys, each weighing \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, are required to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds. We do this by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys."

  0 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Total revenue on Friday:
  \[
  480 + 0 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. The higher revenue day is Thursday, with $520, and Friday, with $480.

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
\[
520 - 480 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the mechanic earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more on Thursday."

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the two different package options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
- Cost difference: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6.00}\) by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"First, we calculate the discount amount on the grooming service. The original cost is $100, and the discount is 30%.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 100 \times \frac{30}{100} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original cost to find the final cost.

\[ \text{Final cost} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

So, the final cost of the grooming is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"First, let's determine how much water each girl received. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:

\[
4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we account for the water the boy received, which is 6 liters. Adding this to the water the girls received, we get:

\[
8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

The total amount of water initially was 24 liters. To find out how much water is left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:

\[
24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the amount of water left is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"

So, 4 times Grace's weight is:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds} \]

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than this amount:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, their combined weights are:
\[ \boxed{623} \]"
"To find the total number of thorns, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses.
2. Calculate the total number of thorns based on the total number of roses.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses.**

Dan plants 3 rose bushes, and each rose bush has 25 roses. Therefore, the total number of roses is:
\[ 3 \text{ rose bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of thorns.**

Each rose has 8 thorns. Therefore, the total number of thorns is:
\[ 75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns} \]

So, the total number of thorns is:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the number of games the team won is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing.
2. Determine the number of vacation blocks he has per year.
3. Multiply the number of years by the number of vacation blocks per year to find the total number of blocks.

First, we calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing. He started vacationing at age 23 and is now 34. Therefore, the number of years he has been vacationing is:
\[ 34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years} \]

Next, we know that Gene goes on four vacations each year. So, the number of vacation blocks he has per year is 4. Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks is:
\[ 11 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ blocks/year} = 44 \text{ blocks} \]

Thus, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is:
\[
\boxed{44}

"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of rings for each of the three alarms and then sum them up.

1. **First Alarm:**
   - The first alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second Alarm:**
   - The second alarm rang for three times as long as the first alarm.
   - Since the first alarm rang 4 times, the second alarm rang \(3 \times 4 = 12\) times.

3. **Third Alarm:**
   - The third alarm rang for half as long as the second alarm.
   - Since the second alarm rang 12 times, the third alarm rang \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) times.

Now, we sum the number of rings from all three alarms:
\[
4 + 12 + 6 = 22
\]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

2. **Annual Salary Increase Policy**: The company increases the salary by 10% every year for employees who have stayed for five years.

3. **Salary After 5 Years**: Since Sylvie has just clocked 5 years in the company, her salary will be increased by 10% at the end of the fifth year. The new salary after 5 years is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = 600 \times (1 + 0.10) = 600 \times 1.10 = 660 \text{ per month}
   \]

4. **Salary After 8 Years (3 More Years)**: After the initial 5 years, her salary will be increased by 10% each year for the next 3 years. We need to calculate the salary for each of these years.

   - **After 6 Years**:
     \[
     \text{Salary} = 660 \times 1.10 = 726 \text{ per month}
     \]

   - **After 7 Years**:
     \[
     \text{Salary} = 726 \times 1.10 = 798.60 \text{ per month}
     \]

   - **After 8 Years**:
     \[
     \text{Salary} = 798.60 \times 1.10 = 878.46 \text{ per month}
     \]

5. **Annual Salary Calculation**: To find her annual salary after 8 years, we multiply her monthly salary by 12:
   \[
   \text{Annual Salary} = 878.46 \times 12 = 10,541.52
   \]

Thus, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is:
\[
\boxed{10541.52}

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald combined is 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold \(\boxed{8000}\) copies."
"First, let's determine how many guests are expected to actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, this means that 3/4 of the invited guests will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends. The number of guests expected to attend is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12
\]

Next, we need to calculate the number of gift bags required. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest. Therefore, the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[
0.75 \times 12 = 9
\]

Each gift bag costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the gift bags is:

"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adults and the children.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad that the adults will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
\text{Total for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ pounds/adult} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) pounds.
- There are 5 children.

\[
\text{Total for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ pounds/child} = 25 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we add the amounts for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad needed:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ pounds} + 25 \text{ pounds} = 225 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"To determine Jackson's age, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children step by step.

1. Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
   - Amy's age = \( A \)
   - Jackson's age = \( J \)
   - Corey's age = \( C \)
   - James's age = 10

2. According to the problem, James is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   C = 10 + 1 = 11
   \]

3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9
   \]

4. Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   A = J + 5
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( A \) we found:
   \[
   9 = J + 5
   \]
   Solving for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 9 - 5 = 4
   \]

Thus, Jackson is \(\boxed{4}\) years old."
"First, let's determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee now runs it in 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. If Gerald's speed improved by 10%, his new time will be 90% of his original time (since a 10% improvement means he is now running 90% as long as he used to).

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, which includes rabbits, dogs, and cats. Let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. **Identify the number of dogs:**
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 60
   \]

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   According to the problem, there are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   \[
   \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
   \]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[
\boxed{348}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

The total number of students is 200. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Since the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:
\[
200 - 80 = 120
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. The problem states that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[
120 - 80 = 40
\]

Thus, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[
\text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, Harry slept \(\boxed{3}\) more hours than James."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes before processing.

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before processing**: Since the sauce made is 32 ounces and it is half the volume of the tomatoes, the volume of the tomatoes before processing is:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes in 4 cans is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of tomatoes Freda used is:

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
- 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
- Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be calculated by adding the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes, and then subtracting the 5 cars that took an exit. This total should equal the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit.

So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has before giving any away. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she has initially is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary decides to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

After giving away these 40 plants, the number of potted plants she will have left is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Mary also received 18 new potted plants from her plant nursery. Adding these to the remaining plants gives:

\[ 40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell \(\frac{1}{4}\) times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all four friends:
\[20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."

\[
\text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Next, we use this rate to find the time to cover 42 miles:
\[
\text{Time to cover 42 miles} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[
42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 14 \times 10 = 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it will take the fog bank \(\boxed{140}\) minutes to cover the whole city."

2. Determine the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces.
3. Calculate the number of pieces Poppy's mom places.
4. Determine the number of pieces left after Poppy's mom places her pieces.

Let's start with the total number of pieces, which is 1000.

1. Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board:
   \[
   \text{Pieces Poppy places} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]
   So, the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces is:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

2. Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces:
   \[

     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Substituting the inner dimensions:
     \[
     V = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
     \[
     \text{Total inner volume} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

Thus, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\) cubic inches."
"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to account for the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week and subtract the known durations of the other shows.

First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on the other days:
- **Monday and Tuesday**: Each day, he watched a 1-hour episode.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Thursday**: He watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Friday**: He watched two 1-hour episodes.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour/episode} \times 2 \text{ episodes} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]

Next, we sum the hours from Monday, Thursday, and Friday:
\[
2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week. Therefore, the hours he watched on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the known hours from the total:
\[
7 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we need to find how many 30-minute episodes make up 1.5 hours:
\[
\frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes}
\]

Thus, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which is \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons at $0.20 per gallon:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final amount:

\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, after the cashback rewards, the gas will cost:

\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To determine the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the number of roll-ups each person had.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total number of roll-ups Beatrice had is calculated by multiplying the width by the length:
  \[
  2 \times 24 = 48
  \]

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total number of roll-ups Marcell had is calculated by multiplying the width by the length:
  \[
  3 \times 14 = 42
  \]

Next, we find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice by adding the individual totals:
\[
48 + 42 = 90
\]

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore:**
   - Julia is 64 seconds away from the shore.
   - It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - Therefore, the total distance is:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
     \[
     \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water taken on during the journey:**
   - Julia rows 80 feet to reach the shore.
   - The total amount of water taken on is:
     \[
     \text{Total water} = 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} = 16 \text{ liters}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is \(\boxed{16}\) liters."

     \]

Thus, the whiteboard is cleaned \(\boxed{24}\) times in a day."
"First, we calculate the total number of flowers Ryan plants over 15 days. Since he plants 2 flowers each day, we multiply 2 by 15:

\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

Next, we account for the fact that 5 of these flowers did not grow. We subtract 5 from the total number of flowers planted:

\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of flowers that actually grew is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. Let's break down the information given and solve it step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   \[
   \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   \[
   \text{Number of birds in Jamal's photograph} = \frac{300}{50} = 6
   \]

Thus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's determine the original cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

1. **Cost of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $10.
   - Sasha has 10 such boards.
   - Total original cost for 2x4x10 boards: \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100 \).

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $16.
   - Sasha has 5 such boards.
   - Total original cost for 4x4x10 boards: \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80 \).

3. **Total original cost:**
   - Total original cost for all boards: \( \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \).

Next, let's calculate the new prices after the 50% increase in lumber prices.

4. **New price of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Original price: $10.
   - Increase: \( 50\% \) of $10 = \( 0.50 \times \$10 = \$5 \).
   - New price: \( \$10 + \$5 = \$15 \).

5. **New price of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Original price: $16.
   - Increase: \( 50\% \) of $16 = \( 0.50 \times \$16 = \$8 \).
   - New price: \( \$16 + \$8 = \$24 \).

Now, let's calculate the total selling price of all the boards.

6. **Total selling price of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - New price: $15.
   - Sasha has 10 such boards.
   - Total selling price: \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150 \).

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total amount of sugar and water used. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total parts of the mixture are \(7 + 13 = 20\) parts.

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. This total corresponds to the 20 parts in the ratio. To find the value of one part, we divide the total amount by the total number of parts:

\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

Since the amount of sugar used corresponds to 7 parts of the ratio, we can find the total amount of sugar by multiplying the value of one part by 7:

\[
\text{Amount of sugar} = 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is \(\boxed{42}\)."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \):
     \[
     L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23
     \]

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Adrien's new salary:
     \[
     40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000
     \]

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her new salary:
     \[
     30,769.23 + 0.4 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92

"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday:**
   Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday each day.
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours per day}
   \]
   Therefore, for both Tuesday and Wednesday:
   \[
   6 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:**
   Sadie slept 1 hour more than the 6 hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   \[
   6 + 1 = 7 \text{ hours per day}
   \]
   Therefore, for the remaining 4 days:
   \[
   7 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total hours for the week:**
   Adding up all the hours:

"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts based on her running speeds.

1. **First 3 hours:**
   - Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in the first 3 hours = Speed × Time = \(10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}\).

2. **Remaining 4 hours:**
   - After the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour.
   - Time remaining = Total time - Time already used = \(7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours}\).
   - Distance covered in the remaining 4 hours = Speed × Time = \(5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}\).

3. **Total distance:**
   - Total distance covered in 7 hours = Distance covered in the first 3 hours + Distance covered in the remaining 4 hours = \(30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}\).

Thus, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is \(\boxed{50}\) miles."
"First, we need to determine how many letters Jennie stamped. She put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters that needed stamps. We calculate this as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

So, Jennie stamped 20 letters. These 20 letters are now in the pile of already-stamped letters. We know that after stamping these 20 letters, the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile is 30. Therefore, the number of letters that were already in the already-stamped pile before Jennie started stamping is:

\[
30 - 20 = 10

"Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

Initially, Julia bought a package of \( x \) spoons. Her husband then gave her a package of 5 spoons. So, the total number of spoons she had before using any was:
\[ x + 5 \]

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons left after sampling is:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 \]

According to the problem, after using 3 spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by isolating \( x \):
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is \(\boxed{10}\)."

"To determine how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost of car washes.
2. Multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year.

First, we know that Tom gets 4 car washes a month and each car wash costs $15. Therefore, the monthly cost is:
\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times \$15/\text{car wash} = \$60/\text{month} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he pays in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
\[ \$60/\text{month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$720/\text{year} \]

So, the total amount Tom pays in a year for car washes is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has right before the comparison is made. Brian originally has 20 video games but loses 5, so he has:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ video games} \]

Next, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has and then subtract 5:

\[ 3 \times 15 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \]

Therefore, Bobby has \(\boxed{40}\) video games."
"First, we need to determine how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Scottish unicorns are female. We know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, so we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the items before any additional fees or tips:

- The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\).
- The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\).
- The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\).

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items:
\[15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\]

Next, we need to add a 20% delivery fee to this total. The delivery fee is calculated as:
\[20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\]

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost of the items gives:
\[20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\]

Finally, Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip. Adding this tip to the total with the delivery fee gives:
\[24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00\]

Therefore, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:
\[
\boxed{29.00}
\]"
"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in each test and then find out how many were left uncompleted.

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test:
- The test consisted of 75 questions.
- Mark's rate is 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed in the first test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
- The test consisted of 100 questions.
- Mark's rate is 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed in the second test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Finally, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete from both tests is:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that the number of blue gumballs \( B \) is 12. Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars are available. We know the total number of cars and the number of automatic and manual cars.

1. Total number of cars = 20
2. Number of automatic cars = 12
3. Number of manual cars = 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of the total number of cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the number of each type of bee:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B = 2Q \) into the equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ W + B + Q = 4Q + 2Q + Q = 7Q = 700. \]

Solving for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400. \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. The milk and eggs are food items.

The cost of the non-food items is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

The total cost of the non-food items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the food items (milk and eggs):
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

The total cost of the food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the food items to the cost of the non-food items including tax to get the total cost:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of clients Kim will have. He currently has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so the total number of clients will be:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total expenses for the bleach and cloths. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle and the cost of cloths is $5 per pack. Therefore, the cost per client is:

\[ 2 \text{ bottles} \times \$2/\text{bottle} + 1 \text{ pack} \times \$5/\text{pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \]

Since Kim will have 8 clients, the total expenses will be:

\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times \$9/\text{client} = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare per year:**
   - John has 100 pineapples per hectare.
   - He can harvest every 3 months, which means there are 4 harvests in a year (since 12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

   Therefore, the number of pineapples per hectare per year is:
   \[
   100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pineapples for 10 hectares:**
   - John has 10 hectares of pineapple field.

   Therefore, the total number of pineapples for 10 hectares per year is:
   \[
   400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4000}

"To determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and then sum them up.

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set:
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. The third set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces of the first set:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Now, we sum the pieces from all three sets:
\[
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125
\]

Thus, the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up is:
\[
\boxed{2125}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: 30 bees.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15\) bees.

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: \(2 \times 30 = 60\) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: All the bees that left in the first 6 hours and the next 6 hours, minus those that had already returned in the previous 6 hours.
   - Bees that left in the first 6 hours and the next 6 hours: \(30 + 60 = 90\) bees.
   - Bees that had already returned in the previous 6 hours: 15 bees.

"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Steve is the winner, we need to find out how long he will wait for Tim:
- Difference in time: \(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will wait for the loser (Tim) for \(\boxed{4}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the number of tires Shawnda inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we sum the total number of tires inflated:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost in cents is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar):
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries in total.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's work backwards from the end to the beginning:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate their 9 fries, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate its 7 fries, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate his 14 fries, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
  - Each day, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
  - Total hours per day: \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
  - Total hours for 3 days: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
  - Each day, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.

Now, we add the hours from all the days in one week:
\[
9 \text{ hours (MWF)} + 8 \text{ hours (TTh)} = 17 \text{ hours per week}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours for the entire semester, which has 16 weeks:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

Next, we sum the total lengths in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we convert the total length from inches to feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches:
\[ 3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"

"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. The football field is 100 yards long, and Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Therefore, the distance Blake runs in one back and forth trip is:
\[ 100 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 200 \text{ yards} \]
Since Blake does this 15 times, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 200 \text{ yards} \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of:
\[ 40 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 80 \text{ yards} \]
Since Kelly does this 34 times, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 80 \text{ yards} \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."

"To determine the water depth in the tank on Wednesday, we need to follow the changes in depth step by step.

1. **Initial Depth on Monday:**
   The tank has a depth of 17 feet on Monday.

2. **Depth on Tuesday:**
   On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
   \[
   17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Depth on Wednesday:**
   On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{48}{3} \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}

"To determine the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Calculation**:
   - The price increases by 20% every two months. This means the price is multiplied by \(1 + \frac{20}{100} = 1.20\) every two months.
   - Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we need to apply the 20% increase 18 times.

3. **Final Price Calculation**:
   - The formula to find the final price after 18 two-month periods is:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

4. **Compute the Final Price**:
   - First, calculate \(1.20^{18}\):
     \[
     1.20^{18} \approx 10.0633
     \]
   - Then, multiply this result by the initial price:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 10.0633 \approx 201.266
     \]

5. **Rounding**:
   - Typically, prices are rounded to the nearest cent, so the final price is:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} \approx 201.27
     \]

Therefore, the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{201.27}\)."

   The problem states that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since one action figure costs $5, the cost of the doll is:
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - There are 5 red cars, each costing $4. Therefore, the total cost of the red cars is:
     \[
     5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - There are 3 action figures, each costing $5. Therefore, the total cost of the action figures is:
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The doll costs $15.

   Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of all the toys:
   \[
   20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total value of all the toys is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. **Calculate the lost income from doing taxes herself:**
   - Jackie loses $35 for each hour of freelance work she doesn't do.
   - She will be doing 3 fewer hours of freelance work.
   - Therefore, the lost income is:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 105 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of hiring the accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.

3. **Determine the net difference in money:**
   - The net difference is the lost income from doing taxes herself minus the cost of hiring the accountant.
   - Therefore, the net difference is:
     \[
     105 \text{ dollars} - 90 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have \(\boxed{15}\) dollars more."
"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she is purchasing and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Mouse: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, we sum up the costs of the items that are not included in the computer price:
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total additional cost:
\[ 157 + 74 + 102 = 333 \]

Next, we add this total to the cost of the computer:
\[ 1090 + 333 = 1423 \]

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
\[ 1500 - 1423 = 77 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[
\boxed{77}
\]"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, the total number of eggs needed is:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
   \[
   S = 2B
   \]
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   B + S + 4 = 28
   \]
   Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
   \[
   B + S = 24
   \]

Now we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
B + 2B = 24
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3B = 24
\]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[
B = 8
\]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[
S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

So, Seth is \(\boxed{16}\) years old."

So, Jimmy has \(\boxed{18}\) dollars."
"To determine how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to break down his walking schedule.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - Pancho walks 20 miles each day.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Total miles walked on weekdays: \( 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Pancho walks 10 miles each day.
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - Total miles walked on weekends: \( 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Total miles walked in a week:**
   - Sum of miles walked on weekdays and weekends: \( 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \).

Thus, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the hat:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the hat} = \$25
   \]

2. **Cost of the jacket:**
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times \$25 = \$75
   \]

3. **Cost of the pants:**
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket.
   \[
   \text{Average cost} = \frac{\text{Cost of the hat} + \text{Cost of the jacket}}{2} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = \$50
   \]

4. **Total cost of the uniform:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the hat} + \text{Cost of the jacket} + \text{Cost of the pants} = 25 + 75 + 50 = \$150
   \]

Thus, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[
\boxed{150}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of each bird and then find their total age.

1. **Sally Thirtytwo's age:**
   Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

2. **Sally Four's age:**
   Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

3. **Granny Red's age:**
   Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Therefore, Granny Red's age is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Sally Two's age:**
   Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Therefore, Sally Two's age is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19 \text{ years old}
   \]

5. **Total age of the four birds:**
   Now, we sum the ages of all four birds:

The total age of the four birds is \(\boxed{49}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make for all her debts. This is the sum of the minimum payments for her student loans, credit card, and mortgage:

\[
300 \text{ (student loans)} + 200 \text{ (credit card)} + 500 \text{ (mortgage)} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% of the minimum payment, we calculate:

\[
0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding this to the minimum payment gives:

\[
1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
\]

This is the total amount Jessica pays each month. To find the total amount she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time spent on peeling and cutting each potato and then multiply by the number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to find the total time for peeling and cutting all of them.

### Peeling Time Calculation
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes: \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \)

### Cutting Time Calculation
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes: \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \)

Convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \)

### Total Time Calculation
- Total time for peeling: 90 minutes
- Total time for cutting: 5 minutes
- Total prep time: \( 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \)

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[
\boxed{95 \text{ minutes}}

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost of lemons and sugar.
   - The profit is given by the total revenue minus the total cost: \( \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - C \).
   - Therefore, \( 25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C \).

2. **Express the total revenue in terms of the number of glasses sold:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of glasses sold.
   - Each glass is sold for $0.50, so the total revenue is \( 0.50x \).

3. **Express the total cost in terms of the number of gallons made:**
   - Let \( g \) be the number of gallons made.
   - Each gallon costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is \( 5g \).

4. **Relate the number of glasses sold to the number of gallons made:**
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon, so \( x = 20g \).

5. **Substitute \( x \) and \( C \) into the profit equation:**
   - Substitute \( x = 20g \) and \( C = 5g \) into the profit equation:
     \[
     25 = 0.50(20g) - 5g
     \]

6. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     25 = 10g - 5g
     \]
     \[
     25 = 5g
     \]

7. **Solve for \( g \):**
   - Divide both sides by 5:
     \[
     g = 5
     \]

8. **Calculate the total cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost of lemons is \( 3g \):
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15
     \]

Thus, the amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of Chinese participants:**

   - Therefore, the number of Chinese participants is:
     \[
     240 - 80 = 160
     \]

2. **Determine the number of girls on the Chinese team:**
   - We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60.
   - Let \( G \) represent the number of girls on the Chinese team.
   - The total number of Chinese participants is the sum of the number of boys and girls:
     \[
     60 + G = 160
     \]
   - Solving for \( G \):
     \[
     G = 160 - 60 = 100
     \]

Thus, the number of girls on the Chinese team is \(\boxed{100}\)."

"To determine the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of crabs Bo has.
2. Use Bo's number of crabs to find out how many crabs Monic has.
3. Use Monic's number of crabs to find out how many crabs Rani has.
4. Sum the number of crabs each person has.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as \( B \). So, \( B = 40 \).

Next, we need to find out how many crabs Monic has. According to the problem, Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Let's denote the number of crabs Monic has as \( M \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ M = B - 4 \]
Substituting the value of \( B \):
\[ M = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many crabs Rani has. The problem states that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Let's denote the number of crabs Rani has as \( R \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ R = M + 10 \]
Substituting the value of \( M \):
\[ R = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Finally, we need to find the total number of crabs the three have together. We do this by summing the number of crabs each person has:
\[ \text{Total} = B + M + R \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Total} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is \(\boxed{122}\)."
"To determine how much Lloyd earned over the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate his earnings for the first week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the first week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours worked} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate his earnings for the second week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the second week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours worked} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both weeks to find the total earnings:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings for the first week} + \text{Earnings for the second week} = 50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of \(\boxed{130}\) dollars for the first two weeks."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we start by calculating the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes. Given that the total number of students who voted is 80, we can find the number of votes the winner received by calculating:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{4} = \frac{240}{4} = 60
\]

So, the winner received 60 votes. Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to establish the relationship between the quantities of different flowers ordered by Sandra.

1. Let \( w \) represent the number of white carnations ordered.
2. According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses ordered is \( 4w \).
3. Sandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   5w = 200
   \]
4. Solving for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
   \]
5. Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses ordered:
   \[
   4w = 4 \times 40 = 160
   \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{160}\) red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Let's denote the current ages of Jean and Mark as \( J \) and \( M \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark:
\[ J = M + 2 \]

2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. Since Jan is currently 30 years old, two years ago Jan was 28 years old. Therefore, two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \), and half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \). So, we can write the equation:
\[ M - 2 = 14 + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = 19 \]
\[ M = 21 \]

Now that we know Mark's current age is 21, we can find Jean's current age using the first equation:
\[ J = M + 2 \]
\[ J = 21 + 2 \]
\[ J = 23 \]

So, Jean is \(\boxed{23}\) years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four runners, the total time for the faster team is:
\[
4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Slower Team:**
The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Therefore, the times for the four runners are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds
- Third runner: \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds
- Fourth runner: \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds

The total time for the slower team is the sum of these times:
\[
60 + 57 + 54 + 51
\]

We can add these step-by-step:
\[
60 + 57 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 54 = 171
\]
\[
171 + 51 = 222
\]

So, the total time for the slower team is 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
To find out how many seconds the faster team wins by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:
\[
222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then find the difference between these probabilities, expressed as a percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number greater than 3}) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in probabilities

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]

### Step 4: Convert the difference to a percentage

To express the difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{25\%}

"To determine the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother, we start by identifying the number of apples each person picked.

1. Jenna's mother picked 20 apples.
2. Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. Therefore, we calculate the number of apples Jenna picked as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

Next, we add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother to find the total number of apples picked:
\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} + \text{Number of apples her mother picked} = 10 + 20 = 30
\]

Thus, the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage. Let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits is 20.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed among all the small rodents is 160.
   - Subtract the pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total:
     \[
     160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces (hamsters)} - 20 \text{ pieces (rabbits)} = 90 \text{ pieces}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of rats and the number of pieces of straw each rat receives:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats.
   - The total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is:
     \[
     6r = 90
     \]
   - Solve for \( r \):
     \[
     r = \frac{90}{6} = 15
     \]

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - The total number of rats is 15, so:
     \[
     3n = 15
     \]
   - Solve for \( n \):
     \[
     n = \frac{15}{3} = 5

"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued each month and add it to the principal amount.

1. **Initial Principal**: $100
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02

**Month 1:**
- Interest for the first month: \(100 \times 0.02 = 2\)
- Total amount after the first month: \(100 + 2 = 102\)

**Month 2:**
- Interest for the second month: \(102 \times 0.02 = 2.04\)
- Total amount after the second month: \(102 + 2.04 = 104.04\)

**Month 3:**
- Interest for the third month: \(104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808\)
- Total amount after the third month: \(104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208\)

"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost to buy each bag is $20, and the cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The total profit from selling \( x \) bags is given as $400. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 8:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the number of bags the trader sold is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"

First, we know that John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total number of minutes as follows:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly requirement of insects for the flock.
2. Convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for a flock of ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly requirement by 7:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in the number of trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Number of trees left**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

So, the number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the final number of pink and white flamingos in Sue's front yard.

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are:
     \[
     18 - 6 = 12
     \]
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is:
     \[
     12 + 18 = 30
     \]
   - The total number of white flamingos is the 6 that were painted white:
     \[
     6
     \]

4. **Finding the Difference:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is:
     \[
     30 - 6 = 24

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each cup. Let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Let the cost of one cup be \( x \).
   - Twenty dozen cups mean \( 20 \times 12 = 240 \) cups.
   - The total cost for 240 cups is \( 240x \).

3. **Set up the relationship between the cost of cups and plates:**
   - According to the problem, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     240x = 6000 - 1200
     \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   240x = 4800
   \]

Thus, the cost of each cup is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and the shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how much money Sara will earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn. Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her earnings from babysitting are:
\[4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars}\]

Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn. She earns $4 each time, so her earnings from mowing the lawn are:
\[4x \text{ dollars}\]

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, her total savings before she starts mowing the lawn is:
\[10 + 20 = 30 \text{ dollars}\]

To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we set up the equation for her total savings to be at least $70:
\[30 + 4x = 70\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[4x = 70 - 30\]
\[4x = 40\]
\[x = \frac{40}{4}\]
\[x = 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn \(\boxed{10}\) times before she can afford the jacket and shoes."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. The number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The eggs produced by the red chickens and the white chickens can be expressed as:
- Red chickens produce \( 3r \) eggs a day.
- White chickens produce \( 5w \) eggs a day.

Since the total number of eggs collected each day is 42, we can write the equation:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, the number of red chickens is \( r = 4 \).

To verify, if \( r = 4 \), then \( w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \). The total number of eggs produced would be:
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]
This matches the given total of 42 eggs per day.

Therefore, the number of red chickens is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the perimeter of the park:**
   The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
   \]
   Substituting the given dimensions:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the time spent walking:**
   Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a constant speed \( v \) is given by:
   \[
   t = \frac{d}{v}
   \]
   Here, the distance \( d \) is the perimeter of the park, which is 15 miles, and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour. Therefore:
   \[
   t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers counted on the first day.
2. Calculate the number of customers counted on the second day.
3. Use the total number of customers over the three days to find the number of customers on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

Next, on the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Let the number of customers on the third day be \( x \). According to the problem, the total number of customers over the three days is 500. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 250 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons and in the small pool as \( S \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that currently, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

So, Lori will have to work \(\boxed{44}\) hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 each month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of roses in the vase.
2. Calculate the number of dahlias in the vase.
3. Add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers.

Step 1: Identify the number of roses.
The problem states that there are 4 roses in the vase.

Step 2: Calculate the number of dahlias.
The problem also states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Therefore, the number of dahlias is:
\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Step 3: Add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers.
The total number of flowers is:
\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

Next, we need to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years old}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years will be:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years old}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years will be:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years old}
  \]

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine how many points Jojo scored, we need to first calculate the points scored by each of the other three students: Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. We know the total points scored by all four students is 251.

1. **Naomi's Points:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Points:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. First, we calculate half of Naomi's points:
   \[
   \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   Then, we add 10 to this value:
   \[
   34 + 10 = 44
   \]
   So, Yuri scored 44 points.

3. **Brianna's Points:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Therefore:
   \[
   68 + 17 = 85
   \]
   So, Brianna scored 85 points.

4. **Jojo's Points:**
   To find Jojo's points, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
   \[
   251 - (68 + 44 + 85)
   \]
   First, we calculate the sum of the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 = 197
   \]
   Then, we subtract this sum from the total points:
   \[
   251 - 197 = 54
   \]

Thus, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent solving puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on Sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one Sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 Sudoku puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on Sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial amount of water in the tank:**
   \[
   120 \text{ liters}
   \]

2. **Water used by Celine:**
   \[
   90 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. **Water left in the tank after Celine used some:**
   \[
   120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]

4. **Rainwater collected:**
   The rainwater collected is twice the amount of water left in the tank.
   \[
   2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]

5. **Total water in the tank after collecting rainwater:**

"First, let's determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, to find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"First, we need to determine how much the company spends on advertising in the second year. The problem states that the company spends a third of the first year's advertising budget on the second year. The first year's budget is $15000.

To find a third of $15000, we perform the following calculation:
\[
\frac{15000}{3} = 5000
\]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising in the second year.

Next, we add the amounts spent in both years to find the total expenditure:
\[
15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is:

- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.

The cost for Benji is:
\[
18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs for both Carlos and Benji:
\[
90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is:

"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of card after the changes:

- **Fire type**: 30 (unchanged)
- **Grass type**: 20 + 14 = 34
- **Water type**: 40 - 8 = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of cards James has after these changes:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \text{ cards} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. This is calculated by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:
\[ 33 \]

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:

"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate their combined rate:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = \text{Kalinda's rate} + \text{Mom's rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360. To find the time it takes for them to complete the puzzle, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months.
2. Determine the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the first batch.
3. Calculate how many of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.
4. Determine the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months.**

30% of 120 watermelons were ready for harvest:
\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were taken home by Ashlyn.

**Step 2: Determine the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the first batch.**

Subtract the number of watermelons taken by Ashlyn from the total:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

So, 84 watermelons remained.

**Step 3: Calculate how many of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.**

3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

So, 63 watermelons were harvested after two weeks.

**Step 4: Determine the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.**

Subtract the number of watermelons harvested after two weeks from the remaining watermelons:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine the total amount Mark pays for the fleet of cars, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars:**
   Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**
   The tax rate is 10%, so the tax on the cars is:
   \[
   \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total registration fee:**
   The registration fee for each car is $1,000, and there are 12 cars.
   \[
   \text{Total registration fee} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   The total amount paid is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000

"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we need to follow the process step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new pens.
3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 5 pens he made from the first cycle, giving him a total of 10 pens. From these 10 pens, he can make \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \) new pens.
4. **Third Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 2 new pens plus the 2 pens he made from the second cycle, giving him a total of 4 pens. From these 4 pens, he can make \( \frac{4}{5} = 0 \) new pens (since 4 is less than 5).

So, the total number of pens he can have is the sum of the pens he initially bought and the pens he made in each cycle:
\[ 25 + 5 + 2 = 32 \]

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Determine the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Determine the number of students who went out through exit C by subtracting the students who went out through exits A and B from the total number of students.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit A} = 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. **Determine the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike still has after he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals and he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he now has:

\[5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals}\]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is:

\[3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages}\]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages in a week. The total number of pages Mike writes in a week is:

\[30 \text{ pages (replies)} + 30 \text{ pages (original letters)} = 60 \text{ pages}\]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing in a week is:

\[60 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 360 \text{ minutes}\]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[360 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 6 \text{ hours}\]

So, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[\boxed{6}\]"
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day over 30 days:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of minutes Jason has left is:

\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries Griffin had at each stage and how many fries Ginger gave him.

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries.
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 24 - 5 = 19
   \]

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 19 - 10 = 9
   \]

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \(x\) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   9 + x \text{ fries}
   \]

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x
   \]

6. **Final number of fries Griffin had:**
   We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries.
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]

7. **Solving for \(x\):**
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin \(\boxed{20}\) fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 28 = 4f \]

To find \( f \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To determine how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours required:**
   - The makeup artist works 6 hours each day.
   - She needs it done 4 times a week.
   - The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 6 \, \text{hours/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 120 \, \text{hours} \times 250 \, \text{\$/hour} = 30000 \, \text{\$}

   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 30000 \, \text{\$} \times 0.10 = 3000 \, \text{\$}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**

   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 30000 \, \text{\$} - 3000 \, \text{\$} = 27000 \, \text{\$}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Jean paid is:

\[
\boxed{27000}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of cookies Sue and her sister ate each day and then calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Finally, we will find the difference in calories consumed.

First, let's determine the number of cookies Sue and her sister ate on Monday:
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

Next, let's determine the number of cookies Sue and her sister ate on Tuesday:
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days:
- Sue's sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.
- Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies in total.

Next, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:
\[9200 - 3600 = 5600\]

So, Sue consumed \(\boxed{5600}\) more calories than her sister."

"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of animals killed last night:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Determine the number of animals killed today:**
   - Let \( C \) be the number of cougars killed today.
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3C \).
   - Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. Therefore, \( C = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

3. **Calculate the number of wolves killed today:**
   - Since \( C = 12 \), the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

4. **Summarize the total number of animals killed:**
   - Wolves killed last night: 10
   - Cougars killed last night: 15
   - Wolves killed today: 36

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

To find 30% of Mitchel's slides:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, which means:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Anne went down the slide 21 times.

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times, we calculate:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide \(\boxed{84}\) times."
"First, let's determine the initial number of cows in the ten stalls. Since each of the ten stalls has 20 cows, the total number of cows is:

"Let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( A_a \) be the number of apples Andrea has.
2. Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
3. Let \( A_b \) be the number of bananas Andrea has.
4. Let \( J_b \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.

From the problem, we know:
- Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \).
- Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \).
- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
- Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_a = 52 \).

First, substitute \( A_a = 52 \) into the equation \( A_a = J_a + 8 \):
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( J_a = 44 \) into the equation \( J_b = J_a + 4 \):
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Next, substitute \( J_b = 48 \) into the equation \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \):
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Now, we can find the total number of fruits:
- Andrea's total fruits: \( A_a + A_b = 52 + 24 = 76 \)
- Jamal's total fruits: \( J_a + J_b = 44 + 48 = 92 \)

The total number of fruits is:
\[ 76 + 92 = 168 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days and then find out how much flour is required for that total number of cookies.

1. Calculate the total number of cookies:
   \[
   36 \text{ cookies today} + 30 \text{ cookies tomorrow} = 66 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. Determine how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can set up the following proportion:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
   \]
   Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups}
   \]

Therefore, Carla will need \(\boxed{11}\) cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of pennies in the stack.
2. Convert the number of pennies to dollars.

First, we calculate the number of pennies in the stack. The stack contains two-thirds of the 9,300 pennies in the cup. We can find this by multiplying 9,300 by \(\frac{2}{3}\):

\[
9300 \times \frac{2}{3} = 9300 \times 0.6667 = 6200
\]

So, the stack contains 6,200 pennies.

Next, we convert the number of pennies to dollars. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we divide 6,200 by 100:

\[
6200 \div 100 = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is \(\boxed{62}\)."

   \]
3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
   \[
   \text{Daisy's money} = 125 + 50 = 175
   \]

Next, we add the amounts of money each girl has to find the total combined amount:
\[
\text{Total combined amount} = 100 + 125 + 175
\]

Now, let's perform the addition:
\[
100 + 125 = 225
\]
\[
225 + 175 = 400
\]

Thus, the total amount of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined is:
\[
\boxed{400}

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500
   \]

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total price of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = \$409,500
   \]

4. **Determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} = 409,500 - 400,000 = \$9,500
   \]

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the selling price, the transfer fees, the brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total additional costs:**
   The total additional costs are the sum of the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.
   \[
   \text{Total additional costs} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   The net proceeds are the selling price minus the total additional costs and the remaining loan amount.
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000
   \]

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are \(\boxed{118000}\)."

     20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - The time taken to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time taken to heat the oil from room temperature to 400 degrees.
   - Time to cook the chicken is:
     \[
     28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total time:**
   - Summing up all the times:
     \[
     20 \text{ minutes} + 28 \text{ minutes} + 23 \text{ minutes} = 71 \text{ minutes}

\text{Cost of newspaper ads} = 50 \text{ ads} \times 5 \text{ dollars/ad} = 250 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- The agent bought 15 television ads.

\[
\text{Cost of television ads} = 15 \text{ ads} \times 75 \text{ dollars/ad} = 1125 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 250 \text{ dollars} + 1125 \text{ dollars} = 1375 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the real estate agent spent a total of \(\boxed{1375}\) dollars on buying all the ads."

"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary bought, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag contains 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag:
   \[
   300 + 12 = 312
   \]
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]

Now, we add the number of M&Ms from all three bags:
\[
300 + 312 + 150 = 762
\]

Thus, the total number of M&Ms Mary bought is:
\[
\boxed{762}

"To determine the total number of windows between the houses, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.

   Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house is:
   \[
   3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows per bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}
   \]

   Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses is:
   \[
   6 \text{ windows per house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of additional windows in each house:**
   - Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms.

   Therefore, the total number of additional windows for both houses is:
   \[
   4 \text{ windows per house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of windows:**
   - Add the number of windows in the bedrooms to the number of additional windows.

   \[
   12 \text{ windows in bedrooms} + 8 \text{ additional windows} = 20 \text{ windows}
   \]

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine the change the mother receives, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased. The items and their respective costs are:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

We add these amounts together to find the total cost:

\[
4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35
\]

First, add the cost of the cocoa and the laundry:

\[
4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65
\]

Next, add the cost of the pasta to the result:

\[
13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00
\]

The total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[
20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00
\]

Thus, the change the cashier gives back is:

\[
\boxed{5.00}

"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we need to break down the total number of stitches and allocate them according to the given information.

1. **Total number of stitches for the sweater:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches} = 1800
   \]

2. **Stitches for the body of the sweater:**
   \[
   \text{Body stitches} = 900
   \]

3. **Stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body.
   \[
   \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

4. **Stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

5. **Stitches for the sleeves:**
   The total number of stitches for the sleeves can be found by subtracting the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches.
   \[
   \text{Sleeves stitches} = 1800 - (900 + 90 + 180)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sleeves stitches} = 1800 - 1170 = 630
   \]

6. **Stitches per sleeve:**
   Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of sleeve stitches by 2.
   \[
   \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

Thus, each sleeve takes \(\boxed{315}\) stitches."

"First, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the small holes. Since it takes him 3 minutes to dig one small hole, for 30 small holes, the time spent is:
\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the large holes. Since it takes him 10 minutes to dig one large hole, for 15 large holes, the time spent is:
\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both small and large holes to get the total time in minutes:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( S \):
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides to solve for \( 3S \):
\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3 to find \( S \):
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently \(\boxed{6}\) years old."

1. Calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week.
2. Sum the total number of stories written by each person over the two weeks.

First, let's find out how many stories each person wrote in the second week. According to the problem, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week.

- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. In the second week, she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week. In the second week, he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week. In the second week, she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Next, we calculate the total number of stories each person wrote over the two weeks.

- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the 76-star flag, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of stars (76) to find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows.
3. Divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows.

Let's start with the first step:

The three rows of 8 stars contain:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

The two rows of 6 stars contain:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

Next, we subtract this number from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Now, we divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows:

"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The formula to calculate time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane travels at 30 miles per hour and covers the same distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the slow lane car to travel this distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate the number of medals Izzy has as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we find the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals of Ali and Izzy} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Let's denote the total number of medals given out for counting as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

   There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 bars are to be shared equally among them.
   \[
   \frac{16 \text{ bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bars/child}
   \]

Thus, each child will get \(\boxed{2}\) chocolate bars."
"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Susan works:**
   - Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.
   - She pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is \(3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Convert the working time into minutes:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, \(2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes}\).

3. **Determine how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:**
   - \(150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals}\).

"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

1. **Mike's points**: Mike has 21 points.
2. **Jim's points**: Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so:
   \[
   \text{Jim's points} = 21 - 3 = 18
   \]
3. **Tony's points**: Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so:
   \[
   \text{Tony's points} = 2 \times 21 = 42
   \]

Next, we need to check if each player has over 20 points to determine if they get an extra point in the fourth round:

1. **Mike's points**: Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.
2. **Jim's points**: Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point.
3. **Tony's points**: Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to the points each player has:

1. **Mike's total points**: 
   \[
   21 + 1 = 22
   \]
2. **Jim's total points**: 
   \[
   18 + 0 = 18
   \]
3. **Tony's total points**: 
   \[
   42 + 1 = 43
   \]

Finally, we sum up the total points of all three players:

"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges each son washes. The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges. The youngest son is 4 years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

Now, we calculate the total number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will originally bought 15 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is \(\boxed{3}\)."

- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, we sum the activities for each type over the two days:

**Total pushups:**
\[ 100 + 120 = 220 \]

**Total squats:**
\[ 50 + 40 = 90 \]

**Total dumbbell presses:**
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Finally, we sum all the activities together:
\[ 220 + 90 + 60 = 370 \]

Thus, the total count of the activities he has done in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{370}

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily rice consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - Each person eats rice at lunch and dinner, so each person consumes \(0.2 \, \text{kg} \times 2 = 0.4 \, \text{kg}\) per day.
   - For 5 members, the total daily consumption is \(0.4 \, \text{kg} \times 5 = 2 \, \text{kg}\).

2. **Calculate the total weekly rice consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly consumption is \(2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{kg}\).

3. **Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - The total amount of rice is 42 kg.
   - The weekly consumption is 14 kg.
   - The number of weeks the rice will last is \(\frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}\).

Thus, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Monday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Tuesday: 15 crates.
- Wednesday: 12 crates.
- Thursday: 18 crates.
- Friday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Saturday: 20 crates.
- Sunday: 20 crates.

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Sunday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 + 20 = 85 \]

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 85 = 35 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by \(\boxed{35}\) crates from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. Let's break down the process step by step.

1. **Initial Bid:**
   - Carmen starts with the opening bid of $200.

2. **Bids by Other Participants:**
   - There are 3 other people who each bid once. Since the bids rise by $50 each time, the bids by the other participants are:
     - First other participant: $200 + $50 = $250
     - Second other participant: $250 + $50 = $300
     - Third other participant: $300 + $50 = $350

3. **Carmen's Bids:**
   - Carmen bids after each of the 3 other participants. Therefore, her bids are:
     - After the first other participant: $350 + $50 = $400
     - After the second other participant: $400 + $50 = $450
     - After the third other participant: $450 + $50 = $500

4. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost of the desk is the sum of all the bids Carmen makes, including the opening bid:
     \[
     200 + 400 + 450 + 500
     \]

5. **Calculation:**
   - Adding these amounts together:
     \[
     200 + 400 = 600
     \]
     \[
     600 + 450 = 1050
     \]
     \[
     1050 + 500 = 1550
     \]

Thus, the total cost of the desk is \(\boxed{1550}\) dollars."
"To determine how much John pays annually for the driving service, we need to break down the costs into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the daily distance traveled:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, and he has to go there and back each day.
   - Daily distance = \(30 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 60 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Calculate the weekly distance traveled:**
   - John goes to work 5 days a week.
   - Weekly distance = \(60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ miles/week}\).

3. **Calculate the annual distance traveled:**
   - John works 50 weeks a year.
   - Annual distance = \(300 \text{ miles/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year}\).

4. **Calculate the cost per mile:**
   - John is charged $2 per mile.
   - Annual cost for miles = \(15000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars/year}\).

5. **Calculate the monthly bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month.
   - Annual bonus = \(150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year}\).

6. **Calculate the total annual cost:**
   - Total annual cost = Annual cost for miles + Annual bonus
   - Total annual cost = \(30000 \text{ dollars/year} + 1800 \text{ dollars/year} = 31800 \text{ dollars/year}\).

Therefore, the total amount John pays annually for the driving service is:
\[
\boxed{31800}

"First, we need to determine the total amount of time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. According to the problem, on Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes and on Monday he exercised for 16 minutes. Therefore, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday is:

\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how long Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday. The problem states that on Tuesday, he wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time from Monday and Sunday by 2:

\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal is:

\[
\boxed{78}

"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding and printing process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, can print four pages: the left back, the left front, the right front, and the right back.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the number of pages per piece of paper**: When a piece of paper is folded in half, it can print 4 pages. Specifically, the pages are arranged as follows:
   - Left back (page 1)
   - Left front (page 2)
   - Right front (page 32)
   - Right back (page 31)

2. **Calculate the number of pieces of paper needed**: Since 4 pages are printed on each piece of paper, we divide the total number of pages by 4.
   \[
   \frac{32}{4} = 8
   \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which amounts to:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the amount left after spending on rides is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount of money Annika has left is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of books initially**: 250
2. **Number of unsold books currently**: 50
3. **Number of books sold so far**: \(250 - 50 = 200\)
4. **Books sold this year**: 45
5. **Books sold in the first year**: \(2 \times 45 = 90\)

Now, we can find out how many books were sold in the second year:
\[ \text{Books sold in the second year} = 200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65 \]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[ 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

Thus, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"
"First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage. Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of:

\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ hours/week} \]

At a rate of $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

\[ 50 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of weeks in April. April typically has 4 weeks. Therefore, Watson's total earnings for April are:

\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$3200 \]

So, the total amount of money Watson made in April is:

\[
\boxed{3200}

"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40
\]

Next, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales.

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning sales} = 60 - 40 = 20
\]

Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of the remaining 20 loaves.

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds per week. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks) is:

\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the savings from buying the ice cream and the milk separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
\[ 4 \times 0.5 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount saved is:

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Calculate the number of extra arms:**
   - Arms grow every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times a person will grow an extra arm is:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Calculate the number of extra legs:**
   - Legs grow every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times a person will grow an extra leg is:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Calculate the total number of new limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ (arms)} + 3 \text{ (legs)} = 8 \text{ (limbs)}
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of \(\boxed{8}\) new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each:
\[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the suitcases. Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each:
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times the cost of a business suit is:
\[ 5 \times 100 = 500 \]
Adding $700 to this amount gives the cost of the flight ticket:
\[ 500 + 700 = 1200 \]

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the total amount he can spend on the suits, suitcases, and gifts is:
\[ 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \]

Now, we sum the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket to find out how much he has already spent:
\[ 600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950 \]

To find out how much Theo has left to spend on gifts, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount he can spend:
\[ 4000 - 1950 = 2050 \]

Thus, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Identify the number of people and their egg consumption:**
   - There are 5 people in the family.
   - Three people eat 3 eggs each day.
   - The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

2. **Calculate the daily egg consumption:**
   - The three people who eat 3 eggs each day will consume:
     \[
     3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - The two people who eat 2 eggs each day will consume:
     \[
     2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed by the family each day is:
     \[
     9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the weekly egg consumption:**
   - Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week (7 days) is:
     \[
     13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}
     \]

Thus, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"To determine Trent's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know Quinn's age is 30.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Therefore, we can calculate Trent's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Thus, Trent is \(\boxed{32}\) years old."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile. Let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Determine Cera's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - Therefore, Noah was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old six years ago.

3. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Six years have passed since Noah was 20 years old.
   - Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(P = 2 \times 60000 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot 3D + 2 \cdot \frac{D}{2} = 2 \cdot 105 \]
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is:
\[12 + 12 = 24\]

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. According to the problem, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of those 8 people had previous commitments. So, we calculate 1/4 of 8:
\[\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\]

This means that 2 people couldn't come due to previous commitments. Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\]

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited to find out how many people actually showed up:
\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is:
\[\boxed{14}\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marbles Solomon has after buying from Johanna and receiving additional marbles from his father.

1. Solomon initially bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. The store already had 50 marbles.
3. The total number of marbles Solomon had before receiving more from his father is:
   \[
   20 + 50 = 70
   \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as Solomon bought from Johanna.

4. The number of marbles Solomon's father gave him is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{40}{5} = 8
   \]

5. Adding these 8 marbles to the 70 marbles Solomon already had:
   \[
   70 + 8 = 78
   \]

Now, we need to find the total weight of these 78 marbles. Each marble weighs 2 kilograms.

6. The total weight of the marbles is:

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Determine the cost to fill the pool based on the volume and the cost per cubic foot.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Determine the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost to fill the pool is given as $0.10 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. **Number of Girls:**
   The classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

2. **Number of Nongendered Children:**
   The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

3. **Total Number of Children:**
   To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children.
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Thus, the total number of children in the classroom is \(\boxed{123}\)."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion:
   \[
   \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion:
   \[
   \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
6. Solving for \( P \):
   \[
   P = \frac{45}{3} = 15
   \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \)."
"First, let's determine the total number of people at the beginning of the party. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people is:
\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many people left after an hour. Since \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the total number of people left, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]
So, 10 people left the party.

Now, we need to determine how many people stayed at the party. Since 10 people left, the number of people who stayed is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's denote the number of women who stayed as \( w \). The total number of people who stayed is the sum of the men and women who stayed:
\[ 22 + w = 30 \]
Solving for \( w \):
\[ w = 30 - 22 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[
\frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs:

\[
2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = 26 \]

Since the number of loose pencils is 2, we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

To find the number of pencils in the boxes, we subtract 2 from 26:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

So, Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils.

Next, we know that Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together, we add the number of pencils Jam has to the number of pencils Meg has:

\[ \text{Total number of pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold the same number of pencils as the 24 pencils in Jam's boxes, each box can hold 24 pencils. To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee becomes, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the weakening effect of the added cream.

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   - The number of ice cubes used is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the total weakening effect is:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

3. **Weakening Effect of Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - The cream further weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the trade ratio and the total number of new records they received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If the 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Number of old records} = 2 \times \text{Number of new records} \]
\[ \text{Number of old records} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records. 

**Final Answer:**
14"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers, their respective monthly salaries, and then calculate the total monthly payment to all programmers.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees.
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is the remaining employees after accounting for the junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

3. **Determine the monthly salary of senior programmers:**
   - Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Monthly salary of senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
   \]

4. **Calculate the total monthly payment to junior programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
   \]

5. **Calculate the total monthly payment to senior programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
   \]

6. **Calculate the total monthly payment to all programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many lollipops Oscar has at the end.

1. **Initial number of lollipops:**
   Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

2. **Lollipops eaten on the way to school:**
   Oscar eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]

3. **Lollipops given to friends:**
   Oscar gives 14 lollipops to his friends.
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]

4. **Lollipops bought on the way home:**
   Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. He gave 14 lollipops to his friends, so he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
   Adding these to the remaining lollipops:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]

5. **Lollipops eaten later:**
   Oscar eats 3 more lollipops that night and 2 more in the morning. So, he eats:
   \[
   3 + 2 = 5
   \]
   Subtracting these from the total:
   \[
   36 - 5 = 31
   \]

Thus, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is:

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to find out how many percentage points of charge are required. The phone needs to go from 60% to 100%, which is a difference of:

\[ 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

Next, we know that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to find out how many minutes it will take to recharge 40 percentage points, we multiply the number of percentage points by the time it takes to recharge one percentage point:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take \(\boxed{2}\) hours to fully charge the phone."
"First, we start with the number of lollipops Erin initially has, which is 7. Her mother gives her an additional 10 lollipops. To find the total number of lollipops Erin has after receiving more from her mother, we add these two quantities together:

\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \]

Next, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract the 3 lollipops she gave away from the total she had:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of lollipops Erin has left is:

\[
\boxed{14}

"First, let's determine the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[
\text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used the $4 reward. The coupon applied twice the amount of the reward, so the coupon value is:

\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total discount applied to the $43 purchase:

\[
\text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtract the total discount from the $43 spent:

\[
43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the customer paid:

\[
\boxed{31}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

**Job B:**
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs to determine which job pays more and by how much.

**Net pay comparison:**
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B)."

"First, let's calculate the value of each share after the first year. Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. Therefore, the new price per share after the first year is:

\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of all 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the second year is:

\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of all 8 shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"First, let's determine how many hot dogs each person ate.

1. Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
2. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. Therefore, Thomas ate:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Since the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the larger groups, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students in the class is 200, and the students are split into three groups. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows Farmer Brown has, and then calculate the total number of legs.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) be the number of cows.
   - Let \( H \) be the number of chickens.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60:
     \[
     C + H = 60
     \]
   - Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows:
     \[
     H = 2C
     \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( H = 2C \) into the first equation:
     \[
     C + 2C = 60
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     3C = 60
     \]
   - Solve for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
     \]
   - Now, find \( H \):
     \[
     H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Legs:**
   - Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs.
   - Total legs from cows:
     \[
     20 \text{ cows} \times 4 \text{ legs per cow} = 80 \text{ legs}

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. **Pink Frog**: 50 pounds
2. **Blue Beetle**: The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. **Green Toad**: The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. **Yellow Snake**: The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Therefore, the yellow snake weighs:
   \[
   50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]
5. **Red Bird**: The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. Therefore, the red bird weighs:
   \[
   50 - 20 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself. The total weight is the sum of the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, red bird, and the container.

\[
50 \text{ (pink frog)} + 50 \text{ (blue beetle)} + 50 \text{ (green toad)} + 60 \text{ (yellow snake)} + 30 \text{ (red bird)} + 20 \text{ (container)} = 260 \text{ pounds}

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:

\[
10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day}
\]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:

\[
5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day}
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in daily revenue between selling silos and tractors:

\[
\$1100 - \$1000 = \$100
\]

To find the percentage increase in daily revenue, we use the formula for percentage increase:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\%

   - Duration: 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes)

4. **Museum tour on Thursday:**
   - Duration: Half the duration of the cooking class
   - Calculation: \( \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \)

5. **Errands on Friday:**
   - Duration: 2 hours

Now, we sum up all the durations:

\[
1 \text{ hour} + 3 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours}
\]

Adding these together:

\[
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Peyton’s after-work activities will take is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. The school asked for twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies. Since they asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies, the number of plant pots needed for the roses is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots required:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:
\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine how much Andrea saved, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total amount of money Andrea had initially.
2. Subtract the amount she spent on the sweater.
3. Subtract the amount she gave to her brother.
4. The result will be the amount she saved.

Let's go through the calculations step by step:

1. Andrea initially had $36.
2. She spent $11 on a sweater. So, the remaining amount after buying the sweater is:
   \[
   36 - 11 = 25
   \]
3. She then gave her brother $4. So, the remaining amount after giving her brother money is:
   \[
   25 - 4 = 21
   \]

Therefore, the amount Andrea saved is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"First, let's break down the time John spent on each activity:

1. **Boating**: John spends 6 hours boating.
2. **Swimming**: He spends half the time he spends boating swimming, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.
3. **Watching Shows**: He watches 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so he spends \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours watching shows.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
\[
6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours}
\]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time he spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[
0.30T = 15
\]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[
T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours}
\]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[
0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the time John spent sightseeing is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we add the money she already has in her savings, the money she earned from her first job, and the money she earned from her second job:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The cost of the phone is $400. To find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount of money she currently has from the cost of the phone:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the height of the shortest tree.
2. Calculate the height of the second tree.
3. Find the combined height of the shortest and second trees.
4. Determine the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees.

Let's start with the height of the shortest tree:
The shortest tree is 6 feet tall.

Next, we calculate the height of the second tree:
The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we find the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

Finally, we determine the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[
\boxed{34}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars, with each car costing $2, is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 5 teddy bears, with each teddy bear costing $1, is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items Dean bought:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean started with $28. After buying the toys, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities and then see how many friends can be accommodated within her $90 budget.

1. **Cost of Mini-Golf:**
   - Morgan and her friends each need to play one round of mini-golf.
   - The cost for one round of mini-golf is $5.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of friends Morgan can invite. Including Morgan, the total number of people is \( n + 1 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for mini-golf is \( 5 \times (n + 1) \).

2. **Cost of Arcade Tokens:**
   - Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens.
   - This cost is fixed at $5.

3. **Cost of Go-Karts:**
   - Morgan and her friends each want to ride the go-karts twice.
   - The cost for one ride is $10.
   - Therefore, the cost for one person to ride the go-karts twice is \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) dollars.
   - The total cost for go-karts for \( n + 1 \) people is \( 20 \times (n + 1) \).

4. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for the party is the sum of the costs for mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts.
   - Total cost = \( 5 \times (n + 1) + 5 + 20 \times (n + 1) \).

5. **Simplify the Total Cost:**
   - Combine like terms: \( 5 \times (n + 1) + 20 \times (n + 1) + 5 = 25 \times (n + 1) + 5 \).

6. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Morgan's budget is $90.
   - Therefore, \( 25 \times (n + 1) + 5 \leq 90 \).

7. **Solve for \( n \):**
   - Subtract 5 from both sides: \( 25 \times (n + 1) \leq 85 \).
   - Divide both sides by 25: \( n + 1 \leq \frac{85}{25} \).
   - Simplify the fraction: \( n + 1 \leq 3.4 \).
   - Subtract 1 from both sides: \( n \leq 2.4 \).

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, the maximum number of friends Morgan can invite is 2.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. Therefore, the total cost of lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa has left after buying the lollipops each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the amount she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} - 1 \text{ dollar/day} = 4 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she will save:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after 5 days is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pounds of candy Billy bought. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the gumballs:**
   Billy bought 40 gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of gumballs} = 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of money Billy had before buying the gumballs:**
   Since he spent $2 on gumballs, the amount of money he had before buying the gumballs is the remaining money after buying the candy and before buying the gumballs. Let's denote the amount of money he had after buying the candy as \( x \). Therefore, before buying the gumballs, he had \( x \) dollars, and after buying the gumballs, he had \( x - 2 \) dollars. Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the change he had before buying the gumballs is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars. So, \( x = 4 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the amount of money Billy spent on candy:**
   Since he had $10 initially and $4 left after buying the candy, the amount of money he spent on candy is:
   \[
   10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. Therefore, the number of pounds of candy he bought is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's denote the age of Carver's son as \( x \) years.

According to the problem, Carver just turned 45 years old, and this age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[
45 = 2x - 5
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation step by step.

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[
45 + 5 = 2x
\]
\[
50 = 2x
\]

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{50}{2}
\]
\[
x = 25
\]

Therefore, Carver's son is \(\boxed{25}\) years old."
"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance for one trip:**
   - Distance from the first city to the second city: \(75\) miles
   - Distance from the second city to the third city: \(100\) miles
   - Distance from the third city to the first city: \(50\) miles less than the combined distance of the first two segments

   First, find the combined distance of the first two segments:
   \[
   75 + 100 = 175 \text{ miles}
   \]

   Then, subtract \(50\) miles to find the distance from the third city to the first city:
   \[
   175 - 50 = 125 \text{ miles}
   \]

   Now, add all three segments to find the total distance for one trip:
   \[
   75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance for one day:**
   The train makes this trip 3 times a day:
   \[
   300 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips/day} = 900 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of days between services:**
   The train needs service every \(18,000\) miles. To find out how many days it takes to reach \(18,000\) miles, divide \(18,000\) miles by the daily distance:
   \[
   \frac{18,000 \text{ miles}}{900 \text{ miles/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, the train goes between services every \(\boxed{20}\) days."
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. According to the problem, a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:
\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing required:
\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the current points of Sara and Erin.
2. Determine Erin's points before the recent score.

First, we know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Sara currently has 8 points. Therefore, Erin's current points can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin's current points are 24 and she just scored 14 points, we can find out how many points she had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her current points:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of points Erin had before is:

"To determine how much milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Identify the number of sheep that produce 1 kg of milk and the number that produce 2 kg of milk.
   - Mary has 30 sheep in total.
   - Half of the sheep produce 1 kg of milk, so \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep produce 1 kg of milk each day.
   - The other half of the sheep produce 2 kg of milk, so \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep produce 2 kg of milk each day.

2. Calculate the total milk produced by the sheep that produce 1 kg of milk.
   - Each of the 15 sheep produces 1 kg of milk, so the total milk from these sheep is \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg.

3. Calculate the total milk produced by the sheep that produce 2 kg of milk.
   - Each of the 15 sheep produces 2 kg of milk, so the total milk from these sheep is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg.

4. Add the milk produced by both groups of sheep to find the total daily milk collection.

   - Apples picked on Monday: 14
   - Apples picked on Tuesday: 12
   - Apples picked on Wednesday: 24
   - Total number of apples picked:
     \[
     14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \text{ apples}
     \]

Thus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of socks Lindsay has washed. Since she washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair consists of 2 socks, the number of socks from the pairs is:

\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is:

\[ 20 \text{ socks} + 15 \text{ socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:

\[ 50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks} \]

Thus, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of cookies Rachel had after Janet gave her some cookies. Rachel initially bought 23 cookies and Janet gave her 42 cookies. So, we add these two amounts together:

\[ 23 + 42 = 65 \]

Next, we need to account for the cookies that Rachel's brother ate. Her brother ate 44 cookies, so we subtract this number from the total number of cookies Rachel had:

\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies left for Rachel is:

\[
\boxed{21}
\]"
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, we calculate the total interest on the loan:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
Here, the principal is $3,650, the rate is 10% (or 0.10), and the time is 5/12 years (since the loan is for 5 months).

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 = 152.0833 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after 5 months is the principal plus the interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 152.0833 = 3802.0833 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she has to pay per month. We divide the total amount by 5:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.0833}{5} = 760.41666 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's hiking speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

\[
\text{Distance Cho hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's hiking speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

\[
\text{Distance Chloe hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance Cho hiked} - \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km}
\]

Thus, Cho hiked \(\boxed{67}\) kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the amount of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has:
- 50 silver pesos
- 80 gold pesos

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the overall total:
\[ 150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Thus, the total number of pesos they have together is:

"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the total cost. Millie spends $18 on supplies. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups. This is calculated as:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how much land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.
2. According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.
3. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
   \]
5. Now, perform the multiplication:
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
   \]

So, Mr. Ruther originally had \(\boxed{32}\) hectares of land."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26
\]

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

So, the number of girls who can perform is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who can perform} = 26 - 13 = 13
\]

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his five test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, we sum these scores:
\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Let's add them step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400.

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost of 6 erasers is \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) dollars.

Next, calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- Therefore, the cost of 8 pencils is \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \) dollars.

Now, add the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of erasers + cost of pencils
- Total cost = \( 12 + 24 = 36 \) dollars.

Thus, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. According to the problem, he delivers \( \frac{1}{3} \) as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. Since he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson, we calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu as follows:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

Thus, the total number of messages James delivers is:

\[
\boxed{88}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet.

The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives him 9 rides. So, the cost for David is:
\[ \text{Cost for David} = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride.

Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, the cost per ride is:
\[ 2 \text{ tickets/ride} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4 \text{ per ride} \]

Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36 \]

Now, let's find the total cost for both David and Dasha.

The total cost for Dasha is $36, and the total cost for David is $30. Therefore, the combined cost for both is:
\[ \$36 + \$30 = \$66 \]

To find out how much money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying individual tickets, we need to compare the cost of buying individual tickets for both of them to the cost of buying the ride bracelet for David and tickets for Dasha.

The cost if they both bought individual tickets would be:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} \times 2 = \$72 \]

The cost with David buying the bracelet and Dasha buying tickets is:
\[ \$30 + \$36 = \$66 \]

The amount David saves is the difference between the two costs:
\[ \$72 - \$66 = \$6 \]

Therefore, the amount of money David saves is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of gifts Monica is wrapping. She has:

- 6 gifts for her family,
- 4 gifts for her friends, and
- 2 gifts for her teachers.

Adding these together gives the total number of gifts:

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for the bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use \(\boxed{12}\) inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, and the total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

First, let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles can be expressed as:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Therefore, Sam has \(\boxed{15}\) more popsicles than Betty."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount.

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling these services. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original cost. Therefore, the cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.80 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable subscription, which is $60 per month. The amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription and getting the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]"
"First, let's break down the time Carol spends on each activity:

1. **Writing the song**: 4 hours
2. **Recording the song**: Half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. **Editing**: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

Next, we calculate the total work time by summing up the time spent on each activity:
\[
4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we need to find what percentage of the total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total work time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[
\left( \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{1.5}{7.5} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

Now, convert the fraction to a percentage:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100\% = 20\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:
\[
\boxed{20\%}

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Next, we need to find out how many books Wendy wants to place. According to the problem, she wants to place 20 more than double the number of books that can fit in the system. So, we first calculate double the number of books that can fit:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]

Then, we add 20 to this number to find the total number of books Wendy wants to place:

\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, the number of books Wendy will need to carry is:

\[
\boxed{92}

"First, let's determine the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

1. Erica made 20 cards.
2. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with each box containing 15 cards. Therefore, the total number of pre-made cards is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]

Adding the cards Erica made to the pre-made cards:
\[
20 + 30 = 50
\]

Next, we account for the cards Erica passed out and received:

1. Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
2. She passed out 5 cards to her family.
3. She received 17 cards from family and friends.

The total number of cards Erica passed out is:
\[
24 + 5 = 29
\]

Now, we calculate the net number of cards Erica has after passing out and receiving cards:
\[
50 - 29 + 17
\]

First, subtract the cards passed out from the total:
\[
50 - 29 = 21
\]

\]

Next, Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. Again, since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices}
\]

Now, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices}
\]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices Jenny eats from the total number of slices:
\[
12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices}
\]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:

\]

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The problem states that the number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Since there are 30 millipedes, the number of stink bugs is:
\[
2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
\]

Now, we sum the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs:
\[
90 + 30 + 48 = 168
\]

Thus, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:
\[

"First, let's determine the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours a day, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = \frac{7200}{1000} \, \text{kW} = 7.2 \, \text{kW} \]

Next, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = \frac{2700}{1000} \, \text{kW} = 2.7 \, \text{kW} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kW} - 2.7 \, \text{kW} = 4.5 \, \text{kW} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kW/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kW} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy saved in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"

   \[
   \text{Cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
   \[
   \text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of meat} + \text{Cost of cheese} = 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial number of corns in Allan's house.
2. Calculate the new number of cannolis after Allan bought more.
3. Calculate the new number of corns after Allan bought more.
4. Find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis.

**Step 1: Determine the initial number of corns.**

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis initially. Therefore, the initial number of corns is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the new number of cannolis.**

Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new number of cannolis is:
\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the new number of corns.**

Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 more cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]
So, the new number of corns is:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \]

**Step 4: Find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis.**

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is:
\[ 100 + 100 = 200 \]

Thus, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total steps Elliott has already taken:**
   - He finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school.
   - He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
   - After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

2. **Determine the number of steps taken before the jog:**
   - Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, the number of steps he had taken before the jog is:
     \[
     10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
     \]

3. **Calculate the steps taken during the jog:**
   - The steps taken before the jog include the steps to and from school and the short walk with his friend.
   - He took half of his 10,000 steps to and from school, which is:
     \[
     \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
     \]
   - He also took 1,000 steps for the short walk with his friend.
   - Therefore, the total steps taken before the jog is:
     \[
     5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
     \]

4. **Find the number of steps taken during the jog:**
   - The steps taken during the jog can be found by subtracting the steps taken before the jog from the total steps taken before the jog:
     \[
     8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
     \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is \(\boxed{2000}\)."
"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and then compare it to the time he has before he needs to leave.

First, calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words per page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, determine how long it takes Toby to read 9000 words at a rate of 300 words per minute:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words per minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to read the book. After reading, it takes him an additional 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time from the start of reading until he reaches the airport is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, the time he will be early is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment per employee in May: \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars
   - Total payment for all employees in May: \( 600 \times 40 = 24000 \) dollars

2. **Calculate the number of employees remaining after June:**
   - Number of employees who left in June: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment per employee in June: \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars
   - Total payment for all employees in June: \( 600 \times 30 = 18000 \) dollars

4. **Calculate the total payment for both months:**
   - Total payment for May: $24000
   - Total payment for June: $18000
   - Total payment for both months: \( 24000 + 18000 = 42000 \) dollars

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \(\boxed{42000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means that for 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since the second pound is half off).

The cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Since she bought 4 magnets, the total cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Adding the cost of the seashells and the magnets gives:
\[ 1.50 + 1.00 = 2.50 \]

Now, we add up all the expenses:
\[ 4.50 + 2.50 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the final amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the second pack of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice that amount:
\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the two packs of fireworks before the discount:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:
\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks to find the discounted price:
\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Adding this to the discounted price of the fireworks gives:
\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:
\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days:**
   Shannon eats 2 cookies each night. Over 30 days, the total number of cookies she eats is:
   \[
   2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Convert the total number of cookies into dozens:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we convert 60 cookies into dozens by dividing by 12:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of madeleine cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it states that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles are expected to explode.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%

First, calculate the number of candles that are expected to explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Next, calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since the problem does not specify any interaction between the two events (smelling like wet dog and exploding), we assume that the events are independent. Therefore, the probability that a candle both smells like wet dog and explodes is the product of the individual probabilities.

\[ \text{Probability that a candle smells like wet dog and explodes} = \left(\frac{5}{100}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{100}\right) = 0.05 \times 0.01 = 0.0005 \]

Now, calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode} = 0.0005 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, we need to determine the discount price of each blouse. The blouses are on a 30% off rack, so the discount is 30% of the regular price of $20.

To find 30% of $20, we calculate:
\[ 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \]

This means each blouse is discounted by $6. Therefore, the price of each discounted blouse is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the 4 blouses is:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Thus, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the number of apples Joanne gathered from each type of tree:
- From the tallest trees, Joanne gathered 30 apples.
- From the shortest trees, Joanne gathered half of 30 apples, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Let the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees be \( x \).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathered is:
\[ 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \]

Next, we determine the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from each type of tree:
- From the tallest trees, her sister gathered twice as many as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- From the shortest trees, her sister gathered three times as many as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Her sister did not gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathered is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total number of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ (45 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 150 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides, we get:
\[
d = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled over the next two days, which was 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances traveled over the two weeks:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Thus, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the size of Zack's locker:**
   - We know that Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker.
   - Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
   - Therefore, Zack's locker is \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cubic inches.

2. **Determine the size of Timothy's locker:**
   - We know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
   - Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.
   - Therefore, Timothy's locker is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cubic inches.

The size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"First, we determine the elevation of Stanley's comb after it fell 4,000 feet from his initial elevation of 10,000 feet. 

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

So, Stanley's comb is now at an elevation of 6,000 feet.

Next, we need to find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach this elevation. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

To find the difference in elevation between Oliver's current position and the comb's position, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:

\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from the two banks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the amount of money given by the first bank.
2. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
3. Add the amounts from the banks to his initial capital.

First, the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue's total capital now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cats**: There were 50 cats on the rock.

2. **Cats carried away by boats**: Four boats each carried away 5 cats.
   \[
   4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cats}
   \]
   So, the number of cats left after the boats carried some away is:
   \[
   50 - 20 = 30 \text{ cats}
   \]

3. **Cats that ran after a mouse**: Three-fifths of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats}
   \]
   So, the number of cats left on the rock is:
   \[
   30 - 18 = 12 \text{ cats}
   \]

The final number of cats left on the rock is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing structure.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months) at $14 per month:**
   \[
   10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs from each period:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$140 = \$284
\]

Thus, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{284}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Let's denote the savings from the tattered jeans as \( S_t \) and the savings from the jogger jeans as \( S_j \). According to the problem, Cole saved \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Therefore, we can write:
\[ S_j = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_t = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price. Let the original price of the tattered jeans be \( P_t \). The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and the savings from the tattered jeans is $4, so:
\[ P_t - 28 = 4 \]
\[ P_t = 32 \]

Similarly, the savings from the jogger jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price. Let the original price of the jogger jeans be \( P_j \). The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and the savings from the jogger jeans is $2, so:
\[ P_j - 22 = 2 \]
\[ P_j = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:
\[ P_j - P_t = 24 - 32 = -8 \]

Since the problem asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, and the result is negative, it means the tattered jeans originally cost more. The absolute value of the difference is:
\[ 32 - 24 = 8 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6

"To determine how many birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bird feeders:**
   Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others.
   \[
   3 + 3 = 6 \text{ bird feeders}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:**
   - Store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each.
   - Lillian's homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones.
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30 \text{ birds per homemade feeder}
   \]

3. **Assume the distribution of feeders:**
   Since the problem does not specify the exact number of each type of feeder, we assume an equal distribution for simplicity. Therefore, there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders.

4. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:**
   \[
   3 \text{ feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:**
   \[
   3 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds}
   \]

6. **Sum the total number of birds attracted by all feeders:**
   \[
   60 \text{ birds} + 90 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds}
   \]

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see \(\boxed{150}\) birds in her garden each day."
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel:**
   The bagel costs $4.

2. **Cost of the soup:**
   The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. First, we calculate 25% of the bagel's cost:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5
   \]

3. **Cost of the cake:**
   The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, we calculate half of the bagel's cost:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

4. **Total cost of the dinner:**
   Now, we sum the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake:
   \[
   4 + 5 + 2 = 11
   \]

Thus, the total amount Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the ticket:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the ticket} = \$100
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of money Kenny has after buying the ticket:**
   \[
   \text{Money left after buying the ticket} = \$50
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny made from selling the cards:**
   \[
   \text{Total money made} = \text{Cost of the ticket} + \text{Money left} = \$100 + \$50 = \$150
   \]

4. **Determine the price per card:**
   \[
   \text{Price per card} = \$1.5
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of cards Kenny sold:**
   \[
   \text{Total cards sold} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Price per card}} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100
   \]

6. **Understand that Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and sells the rest:**
   \[
   \text{Cards kept} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total cards}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cards sold} = \text{Total cards} - \text{Cards kept} = \text{Total cards} - \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total cards} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total cards}
   \]

7. **Set up the equation using the number of cards sold:**
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total cards} = 100
   \]

8. **Solve for the total number of cards:**
   \[
   \text{Total cards} = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of hotdogs initially prepared:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - These 18 guests would each get 2 hotdogs, so they would consume \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so they would consume \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Determine the number of hotdogs needed with 40 guests:**
   - With 40 guests, half of them (20 guests) would want a second hotdog.
   - These 20 guests would each get 2 hotdogs, so they would consume \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 20 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so they would consume \( 20 \times 1 = 20 \) hotdogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) hotdogs.

3. **Calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, but 60 hotdogs are needed.
   - The shortfall in hotdogs is \( 60 - 54 = 6 \) hotdogs.
   - Since each additional hotdog is for a second hotdog, 6 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. According to the problem, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. We start by calculating half of the letters in Indras' name:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Then, we add 4 to this result to find the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. We add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

Thus, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[
\boxed{13}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[
120 + 20 + 25 = 165
\]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[
165 \times 0.80 = 132
\]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[
\boxed{132}
\]"

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs to buy the items:

Amount needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Amount needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
\]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
\]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of money George had left after buying the chips:**
   - George spent $5 in total.
   - He spent 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each.
   - The cost of 3 bags of chips is \(3 \times 0.40 = 1.20\) dollars.
   - After buying the chips, he had 1% of his money left.
   - 1% of $5 is \(0.01 \times 5 = 0.05\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the amount of money he had left after buying the chips is $0.05.

2. **Calculate the amount of money George spent on candy bars:**
   - The total amount of money George had initially is $5.
   - After buying the chips, he had $0.05 left.
   - Therefore, the amount of money he spent on candy bars is \(5 - 1.20 - 0.05 = 3.75\) dollars.

3. **Determine the number of candy bars George bought:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75.

"First, we need to determine the weight of each piece of cake. Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces, the weight of each piece is:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece}
\]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so they together have:

\[
2.5 \text{ ounces} + 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces}
\]

The total weight of the cake initially was 20 ounces. After Rory and her mom each take a piece, the remaining weight of the cake is:

\[
20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the weight of the remaining cake is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The cost of the onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for the onions is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the length from yards to feet:**
   Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
   \[
   3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the width of the room:**
   The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
   \]
   We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. So, we can solve for the width:
   \[
   360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width}
   \]
   \[
   \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the room:**
   The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet}

"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then use the formula for average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, calculate the distance traveled at each speed:
- For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours:
  \[ \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

- For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
  \[ \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, add the distances to find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, add the times to find the total time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, calculate the average speed:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

The car's average speed during the trip is \(50\) mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she will have:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of her 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

- Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats \(4 \times 30 = 120\) apples.
- Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats \(4 \times 30 = 120\) apples.

Next, add the number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:
- The total number of apples eaten by both in 30 days is \(120 + 120 = 240\).

Thus, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of one raised bed:**
   Each raised bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:
   \[
   V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height}
   \]
   Substituting the given dimensions:
   \[
   V = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total volume of all 10 raised beds:**
   Since there are 10 raised beds, the total volume \( V_{\text{total}} \) is:
   \[
   V_{\text{total}} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of bags of potting soil needed:**

These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there, so the total number of fairies became:
\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \text{ fairies} \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is:
\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \text{ fairies} \]

So, the final number of fairies remaining is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of puppies.
2. Calculate the total number of puppies that have spots.
3. Determine the percentage of puppies that have spots.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of puppies.**

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. Therefore, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of puppies that have spots.**

Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. Therefore, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

**Step 3: Determine the percentage of puppies that have spots.**

The percentage of puppies that have spots is calculated by dividing the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies, and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay: \( 42 \times 75 = 3150 \) pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats: \( 20 \times 65 = 1300 \) pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots: \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - The farmer buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes: \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
\[
3150 \text{ (hay)} + 1300 \text{ (oats)} + 48 \text{ (carrots)} + 2 \text{ (sugar cubes)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."

"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. **Starting Position:** Finley started in 1st place.
2. **First Change:** She fell back 5 spots.
   - \(1 - 5 = -4\)
   - Since positions are positive, this means she is now in 6th place (since she fell back 5 spots from 1st, which is the same as being 5 spots behind the 1st place, i.e., 6th place).

3. **Second Change:** She moved ahead 2 spots.
   - \(6 + 2 = 8\)
   - So, she is now in 8th place.

4. **Third Change:** She fell behind 3 spots.
   - \(8 - 3 = 5\)
   - So, she is now in 5th place.

5. **Fourth Change:** She jumped ahead 1 spot.

"First, we need to calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has. Since she has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck, we can find the total number of basketball cards by multiplying the number of decks by the number of cards per deck:

\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards. She has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box, so we multiply the number of boxes by the number of cards per box:

\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

Now, we find the total number of cards by adding the basketball cards and the baseball cards together:

\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract the number of cards she keeps from the total number of cards to find out how many cards she gives to her students:

\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \]

If each student receives 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the number of cards given to the students by the number of cards each student receives:

\[ 300 \div 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of students Miss Maria has is:

\[
\boxed{30}

Therefore, Kelly paid \(\boxed{1}\) dollar more than Becky."
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to first calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforter per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets. Since each room has 2 sheets, the number of pillow cases is \(2 \times 2 = 4\).
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases. Since each room has 4 pillow cases, the number of towels is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

Now, we sum up all the laundry items per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total laundry items per room = \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\).

Since there are 80 rooms, the total number of laundry items is:

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed by the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{2} + 2
\]

We know that Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{2} = 3
\]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):
\[
x = 6

Thus, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"First, let's convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet since the shark's length is given in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long.

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find what percentage the combined length of the remoras is of the shark's body length, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. 

Final answer:

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (the number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (the number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (the number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides.

Thus, the total number of people going on the tour is \(\boxed{621}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel stay. The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it is a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. We need to find 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 1500 = 0.20 \times 1500 = 300 \]

So, the cost of the hotel per day during the busy weekend is:

\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:

\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each plane ticket costs $5000, and since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to find the total cost of the trip:

"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each currently has from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel. We subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for one horse:**
   Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day.
   \[
   5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for all four horses:**
   There are four horses, so we multiply the daily consumption of one horse by 4.
   \[
   10 \text{ pounds/day/horse} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total oats consumption for five days:**
   We multiply the daily consumption by 5.
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}

"First, we need to determine how much more money the child needs to save to buy the toy car. The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining $8 if he saves $2 each day. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child \(\boxed{4}\) days to save the remaining amount of money."
"To determine how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the trays, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total capacity of the trays.
2. Subtract the total number of eggs from the total capacity of the trays to find out how many eggs won't be placed.

First, we calculate the total capacity of the trays. Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays:
\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we subtract the total number of eggs from the total capacity of the trays to find out how many eggs won't be placed:
\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the trays is:

"To determine how much Sally spends in total, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the cost of the small pizza.
2. Calculate the cost of the family-size pizza.
3. Add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

First, the cost of the small pizza is given as $8.

Next, the cost of the family-size pizza is 3 times the cost of the small pizza. Therefore, we calculate the cost of the family-size pizza as follows:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:
\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

So, the total amount Sally spends is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"To determine the cost per razor after the discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - The original cost of one pack of razors is $4.00.
   - The current sale is ""buy one get one free."" So, if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.
   - Converting this to cents, $0.25 = 25 cents.

Thus, the cost per individual razor after the discount is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, who is 60 inches tall. This cheerleader will be at the top of the human pyramid.

Next, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid has four layers with the following heights for each layer:

1. **Bottom layer (4 cheerleaders):** Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, we assume the 4 cheerleaders at the bottom are among these 9. Therefore, the total height for the bottom layer is:
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer (3 cheerleaders):** These cheerleaders are also among the 9 who are 64 inches tall. Therefore, the total height for the second layer is:
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer (2 cheerleaders):** These cheerleaders are also among the 9 who are 64 inches tall. Therefore, the total height for the third layer is:
   \[
   2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top layer (1 cheerleader):** This cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

Now, we sum the heights of all the layers to find the total height of the human pyramid:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches}\):
\[
\frac{636 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is:
\[
\boxed{53}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many minutes Charisma walks each hour. She walks for 5 minutes every hour.

Next, we calculate the total number of hours she works in one day:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since she walks for 5 minutes every hour, the total walking time per day is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/hour} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes she walks over 5 days. We multiply the daily walking time by the number of days:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To determine Angela's current age, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

1. Let \( A \) represent Angela's current age.
2. Brett's current age is 14 years.
3. In four years, Brett's age will be \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) years.
4. According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Therefore, in four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \).

We can set up the equation based on the information that in four years, Angela's age will be three times Brett's current age:
\[ A + 4 = 3 \times 14 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

So, Angela is currently \(\boxed{38}\) years old."
"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the cost for both the morning and afternoon rides and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning each day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives for 14 days.

\[
\text{Total cost for morning rides} = 14 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ dollars/day} = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon each day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives for 14 days.

\[
\text{Total cost for afternoon rides} = 14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ dollars/day} = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the total costs for both morning and afternoon rides:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 84 \text{ dollars} + 28 \text{ dollars} = 112 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:

\[
\boxed{112}

"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box. Therefore, the total number of oranges Ashley brought is:
\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. Therefore, the total number of oranges Brianne brought is:
\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne to find the total number of oranges they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges required for one pie. Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( x \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the number of guests, \( x \), for which the total costs are equal:
\[
200 + 5x = 25x
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[
200 = 25x - 5x
\]
\[
200 = 20x
\]

Next, divide both sides by 20:
\[
x = \frac{200}{20}
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's define the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4D + 7 = 43
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):
\[
4D = 36
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( D \):
\[
D = 9
\]

Now, we know David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David:
\[
Lily = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]

Thus, the number of insects Lily found is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"To determine the total number of yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used, we need to calculate the amount each used and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
\[ \text{Yarn used by Mariah} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of a skein} \]
Since there are 364 yards in a skein, the amount of yarn Mariah used is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
\[ \text{Yarn used by grandma} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ of a skein} \]
The amount of yarn her grandma used is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[ \text{Total yarn used} = 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Thus, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:

"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry and the other two being grape and green apple. The cost of each pack of grape gum is $2, and the cost of the green apple gum is half of that, which is $1.

The total cost of the gum can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ 2x + 4 + 1 = 7 \]
\[ 2x + 5 = 7 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 2 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ x = 1 \]

So, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is \(\boxed{1}\) dollar."
"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood. The 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks, while the 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood}
\]
If he buys 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood, he will get:
\[
6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces of 2 x 8 wood}
\]
If he buys 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he will get:
\[
4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Comparing the two options, buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood gives him more sticks (1600 sticks) than buying 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood (1200 sticks).

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:
\[
\boxed{1600}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of legs among Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[
\boxed{144}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$4.40 \text{ per day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$4.40 \text{ per day} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Next, we compare this cost to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20. The savings from buying the weekly bus pass is:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to find out how many cows the zoo has. According to the information, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheep the farm has. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the total number of animals on the farm is:
\[ 30 + 10 = 40 \]

The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so the total number of animals in the zoo is:
\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Adding the total number of animals from both the farm and the zoo, we get:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals the farm and zoo have combined is:

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, using the relationship \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

1. **Tony**: Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
2. **Bobby**: Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony. Therefore, Bobby can pick:
   \[
   6 - 1 = 5 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]
3. **Kathy**: Kathy can pick twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby. Therefore, Kathy can pick:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]
4. **Ricky**: Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy. Therefore, Ricky can pick:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]

Next, we sum the number of quarts each person can pick per hour to find the total:

\[
6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29 \text{ quarts per hour}

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days for half a house means 10 days for a whole house).

Next, we need to find out the rate for 5 people working together. Since one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, 5 people working together can paint a whole house in \(\frac{10}{5} = 2\) days.

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem.

1. Let \( O_s \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has.
2. Let \( O_c \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has.
3. Let \( J_s \) be the number of sofas Jenna has.
4. Let \( J_c \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( O_s = 20 \).
- Ophelia and Jenna each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( O_s = O_c - 2 \) and \( J_s = J_c - 2 \).
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( J_c = 3 \times O_c \).

First, we can find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[ O_s = O_c - 2 \]
\[ 20 = O_c - 2 \]
\[ O_c = 22 \]

Next, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ J_c = 3 \times O_c \]
\[ J_c = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ J_c = 66 \]

Now, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has:
\[ J_s = J_c - 2 \]
\[ J_s = 66 - 2 \]
\[ J_s = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have:
- Total sofas: \( O_s + J_s = 20 + 64 = 84 \)
- Total chairs: \( O_c + J_c = 22 + 66 = 88 \)
- Total number of sofas and chairs: \( 84 + 88 = 172 \)

The total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is \(\boxed{172}\)."

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[ 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 \]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin:
\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, calculate the cost of the printer:
\[
\text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700
\]

Next, let the cost of one monitor be \( x \). Therefore, the cost of 2 monitors is:
\[
2x
\]

The total cost equation is:
\[
\text{Cost of the computer} + \text{Cost of 2 monitors} + \text{Cost of the printer} = 2400
\]

Substitute the known values into the equation:
\[
1100 + 2x + 700 = 2400
\]

Combine the constants:
\[
1800 + 2x = 2400
\]

Isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 1800 from both sides:
\[
2x = 2400 - 1800
\]
\[
2x = 600
\]

Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[
x = \frac{600}{2} = 300
\]

Thus, the cost of one monitor is:
\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many seashells each girl brought back from the scavenger hunt.

First, we know that the total number of kids is 20, and they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. Therefore, there are:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ girls and 10 boys} \]

Next, we are given that each boy brought back 60 seashells. So, the number of seashells each boy brought is:
\[ 60 \text{ seashells} \]

The problem states that each girl brought back an amount of seashells equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Let's denote the number of seashells each girl brought as \( G \). According to the problem:
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]

Now, we calculate \( 4 \times 60 \):
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \]

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is:
   \[
   50 \text{ mm} - 5 \text{ mm} = 45 \text{ mm}
   \]
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \text{ mm} = 62 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm} = 188 \text{ mm}
\]

Thus, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we start by noting that April has 30 days. The first half of April consists of the first 15 days, and the second half consists of the next 15 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April. Therefore, in the first half of April, he saves \( 15x \) dollars.

In the second half of April, he saves twice as much each day as he does in the first half, so he saves \( 2x \) dollars each day. Thus, in the second half of April, he saves \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \) dollars.

Elvis's total savings for the month of April is the sum of his savings in the first half and the second half, which is given as $1125. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
15x + 30x = 1125
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
45x = 1125
\]
To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:
\[
x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
\]
So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Since he saves twice as much each day in the second half, he saves:
\[
2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
\]
Thus, the amount Elvis has to save each day in the second half of the month is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit Verna bought.

1. **Cost of apples:**
   \[
   3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50 \text{ per apple} = 3 \times 1.50 = \$4.50
   \]

2. **Cost of oranges:**
   \[
   5 \text{ oranges} \times \$0.80 \text{ per orange} = 5 \times 0.80 = \$4.00
   \]

3. **Cost of peaches:**
   \[
   6 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.75 \text{ per peach} = 6 \times 0.75 = \$4.50
   \]

Next, we sum the costs of all the fruits to find the total amount spent:
\[
\$4.50 \text{ (apples)} + \$4.00 \text{ (oranges)} + \$4.50 \text{ (peaches)} = 4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave the cashier $20. To find the change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

\]

Thus, Jairus will get \(\boxed{6}\) dollars more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money they are dividing is 100 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as follows:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"To determine Mark's initial weight, we need to account for the weight he lost over the 3 months he was unwell. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Calculate the total weight loss over the 3 months:
   \[
   \text{Total weight loss} = \text{Weight loss per month} \times \text{Number of months} = 10 \, \text{pounds/month} \times 3 \, \text{months} = 30 \, \text{pounds}
   \]

2. Determine Mark's initial weight by adding the total weight loss to his final weight:
   \[
   \text{Initial weight} = \text{Final weight} + \text{Total weight loss} = 70 \, \text{pounds} + 30 \, \text{pounds} = 100 \, \text{pounds}
   \]

Thus, Mark's initial weight was \(\boxed{100}\) pounds."
"To determine how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of toys in James's play set:**
   James's play set has 80 toys.

2. **Calculate the total number of toys needed for Jonathan's play set:**
   Jonathan's play set needs to be five times larger than James's play set.
   \[
   5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
   \]

3. **Set up the equation for the number of toys Jonathan currently has:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have 400 toys.
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]
   Subtract 2 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 400 - 2
   \]
   \[
   x = 398
   \]

Therefore, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The cost of five notebooks: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\) dollars
- The cost of two pens: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\) dollars
- The cost of one calculator: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) dollars
- The cost of one geometry set: \(1 \times 10 = 10\) dollars

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 29.50\] dollars

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount means Daniel pays 90% of the total cost. So, we calculate 90% of $29.50:
\[29.50 \times 0.90 = 26.55\] dollars

Therefore, the amount Daniel has to spend on all the items he wants to buy is:
\[
\boxed{26.55}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item Carly ordered:

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned from her sales, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the commission from the first $1000 in sales and the commission from the sales over $1000.

1. **Calculate the commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission amount = $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

2. **Calculate the commission for the sales over $1000:**
   - Sales over $1000 = $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
   - Commission rate for sales over $1000 is 10%.
   - Commission amount = $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

3. **Calculate the total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from the first $1000 + Commission from the sales over $1000.
   - Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, the amount of money Antonella earned is **$450**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of water bottles Bill already has. He has 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. Therefore, the total number of bottles he initially has is:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles per case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of water bottles required for his 70 guests, with each guest getting 2 bottles. So, the total number of bottles needed is:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles per guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy. We subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles required:

\[ 140 \text{ bottles needed} - 48 \text{ bottles he has} = 92 \text{ additional bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy is:

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water. Since it takes him 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, we can calculate the time it takes in warm water as follows:

\[ 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:

\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

John wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him to save this amount, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take John \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save $80."

Thus, the total cost for lunch today is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"To determine the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break the problem into smaller steps.

1. Identify the number of buttons with two holes and the number of buttons with four holes.
   - There are 7 buttons with two holes.
   - The rest of the buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total, the number of buttons with four holes is \(21 - 7 = 14\).

2. Calculate the total number of holes contributed by the buttons with two holes.
   - Each of the 7 buttons has 2 holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

3. Calculate the total number of holes contributed by the buttons with four holes.
   - Each of the 14 buttons has 4 holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is \(14 \times 4 = 56\).

4. Add the holes from both groups of buttons to get the total number of holes.
   - The total number of holes is \(14 + 56 = 70\).

"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily. The daily recommended amount is 4 cups. Since Octavia drinks half of the recommended amount, she drinks:

\[
\frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we calculate how many cups of coffee Juan drinks daily. Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so he drinks:

\[
10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

\[
20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups}

"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Therefore, Susan's weight is:
   \[
   150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Therefore, Bob's weight is:
   \[
   2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends (which is 3):

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle from the ground to the sun after it has moved 10 hours, given that it moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour from the tip of the pyramid.

1. **Initial Angle**: The initial angle from the ground to the sun is the same as the angle of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees.

2. **Rate of Movement**: The sun moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward.

3. **Total Movement**: Over 10 hours, the sun will move:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **Final Angle**: The final angle from the ground to the sun will be the initial angle plus the total movement:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is \(\boxed{82}\) degrees."
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. Therefore, the age of the younger son is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs one candle per year, the total number of candles required is:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so the number of packs required is:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

"First, let's determine how many minutes Judy read each night in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night.

There are 7 nights in a week, so in the first week, she read:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the reading rate in pages per minute:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{1.5} \text{ pages/minute} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 105 \times 1.3333 = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \). According to the problem, Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so we have:
\[ S = 44 \]

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be:
\[ S + 7 = 44 + 7 = 51 \]

At that time, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, in 7 years, his nephew's age will be:
\[ N + 7 \]

We can set up the following equation based on the information given:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently \(\boxed{10}\) years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00.
   - Therefore, for three teeth, the total amount is:
     \[
     3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Since the previous three teeth each received $1.00, half of that amount is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, for two teeth, the total amount is:
     \[
     2 \times 0.50 = 1 \text{ dollar}
     \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Peter spends from Sunday through Wednesday.
2. Determine how much money Peter has left after Wednesday.
3. Calculate how many plastic action figures Peter can buy with the remaining money from Thursday through Saturday.
4. Sum the total number of action figures bought.

First, let's find out how much money Peter spends from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday), we can calculate the daily spending as follows:

\[ \text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

So, the total spending from Sunday through Wednesday is:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we determine how much money Peter has left after Wednesday:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate how many plastic action figures Peter can buy with the remaining $30. Since each plastic action figure costs $2, the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter buys wooden action figures. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

Adding the number of wooden and plastic action figures together, we get the total number of action figures:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"To determine the total cost associated with the kitten, we need to add up the costs of spaying the kitten, the vaccines, and the broken vases.

2. Determine the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
3. Calculate the difference between the number of roses Ford grows in a month and the number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

First, let's find out how many roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses supplied per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we need to find out how many roses Ford grows in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total number of roses Ford grows in a month is:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of roses Ford needs to supply to the flower shops in a month:

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw and then divide that by the number of days.

1. **Total number of birds seen:**
   - Days one and two: 50 birds
   - Day three: 0 birds
   - Days four and five: 120 birds
   - Day six: 20 birds
   - Day seven: 90 birds

   Adding these together:
   \[
   50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280
   \]

2. **Number of days:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

3. **Average number of birds per day:**
   - To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:

"Let's denote the starting value of the number train as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 20 \).

The steps given in the problem can be broken down as follows:

1. Take the starting value \( x \) and add half of it.
2. Divide the result by 5.
3. Multiply the result by the starting value minus 12.

Let's go through these steps one by one.

1. Calculate half of the starting value:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

2. Add this value to the starting value:
   \[
   x + \frac{x}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

3. Divide the result by 5:
   \[
   \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

4. Multiply this result by the starting value minus 12:
   \[
   6 \times (x - 12) = 6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48
   \]

Therefore, the final value of the number train is \(\boxed{48}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct setting for a 520-degree recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting. The actual temperature is 468 when Maggie sets it to 450. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is then:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means Maggie's oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct setting for a 520-degree recipe, we need to determine what temperature, when increased by 4%, results in 520 degrees. Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Then:

\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then sum them up.

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
   - 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes is \(60 + 30 = 90\) minutes.

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
   - 2 hours is equal to \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes is \(120 + 5 = 125\) minutes.

3. Adding the durations of both movies:
   \[
   90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is \(\boxed{215}\) minutes."
"To determine the value of Juan's house and the combined value of both houses, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the value of Herb's house.
2. Calculate the value of Juan's house, which is 30% less expensive than Herb's house.
3. Add the values of both houses to find the combined value.

First, we know that Herb's house is worth $76,000. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, we need to find 30% of $76,000 and subtract it from $76,000.

Calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

Now, subtract this amount from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200. To find the combined value of both houses, we add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

Therefore, the combined value of the two houses is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cups Judy bought:**
   - Judy bought a dozen cups.
   - A dozen is 12.
   - Therefore, Judy bought \( 12 \) cups.

2. **Determine the number of dishes Judy bought:**
   - Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups.
   - Since she bought 12 cups, the number of dishes is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \).

3. **Determine the number of cups and dishes brought by Judy's friend:**
   - Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
   - Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy.
   - Judy brought 24 dishes, so her friend brought \( 24 + 20 = 44 \) dishes.

4. **Calculate the total number of cups brought by both:**
   - Judy brought 12 cups.
   - Her friend brought 40 cups.
   - Total cups: \( 12 + 40 = 52 \).

5. **Calculate the total number of dishes brought by both:**
   - Judy brought 24 dishes.
   - Her friend brought 44 dishes.
   - Total dishes: \( 24 + 44 = 68 \).

6. **Calculate the total number of utensils (cups + dishes) brought by both:**
   - Total utensils: \( 52 + 68 = 120 \).

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the 10% discount. The original price of one box is $100.00, and it is currently 10% off.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times \frac{10}{100} = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Thus, the cost per contact when buying 2 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

**Jill's Work:**
- Saturday: 2 hours
- Sunday: 1 hour
- Total hours for Jill: \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours

**John's Work:**
- Saturday: Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours
- Sunday: Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
- Total hours for John: \(4 + 3 = 7\) hours

Next, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John.

**Jill's Earnings:**
- Rate: $10 per hour
- Total earnings: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars}\)

**John's Earnings:**
- Rate: $10 per hour
- Total earnings: \(7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars}\)

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

**Difference in Earnings:**
- John's earnings: $70
- Jill's earnings: $30
- Difference: \(70 - 30 = 40 \text{ dollars}\)

Thus, John earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories}\)

Next, we add the calories burned from both activities to find the total calories burned:
\[1000 \text{ calories} + 600 \text{ calories} = 1600 \text{ calories}\]

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we set up the following proportion:
\[
\frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{160000 \text{ ml} \cdot \text{calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = 800 \text{ ml}
\]

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink \(\boxed{800}\) ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, we can express the number of red and green jelly beans in terms of \( B \) as follows:

- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[
3B = 4500
\]

Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:

\[
B = 1500
\]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

\[
1515 - 1485 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of green jelly beans is 30 more than the number of red jelly beans. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{30}

"First, let's identify the three measurements of Jared's typing speed:
1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: \(52 + 5 = 57\) WPM

Next, we calculate the average of these three measurements. The formula for the average of three numbers is:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of the numbers}}{\text{Number of measurements}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

First, we find the sum of the numbers:
\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Now, we divide the sum by the number of measurements (3):
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

Thus, the average of the three measurements is:
\[
\boxed{52}

"To determine the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each scenario and then find the difference between these changes.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is:
  \[
  1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is:
  \[
  1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in weight change between the two scenarios:
- The difference in weight change is:
  \[
  8.75 \, \text{pounds} - (-6.25 \, \text{pounds}) = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} + 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 15 \, \text{pounds}

"To determine the total number of seats Alex needs, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. **Email Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people via email.
   - Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people invited by email is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Phone Invitations:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people from phone invitations is \(8\) (since the 8 friends are already counted in the 100 people invited via email).

3. **Total Number of People:**
   - People invited via email: 100
   - Additional people invited by email: 200
   - People invited by phone: 10 (friends) + 8 (spouses) = 18

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, we start with the initial height and the growth pattern. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles in height every day. We need to find the smallest number of days \( n \) such that the height of the beanstalk is greater than 20 feet.

The height of the beanstalk after \( n \) days can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Height} = 4 \times 2^n \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that:
\[ 4 \times 2^n > 20 \]

First, simplify the inequality:
\[ 2^n > \frac{20}{4} \]
\[ 2^n > 5 \]

Now, we need to find the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies this inequality. We can do this by testing successive values of \( n \):

- For \( n = 2 \):
  \[ 2^2 = 4 \]
  \[ 4 \not> 5 \]

- For \( n = 3 \):
  \[ 2^3 = 8 \]
  \[ 8 > 5 \]

Since \( 2^3 = 8 \) is the first value that satisfies the inequality, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can break the problem down into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - A cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, the protein content per gram of mushrooms is:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}
     \]

2. **Determine the daily protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - The protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms is:
     \[
     200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the weekly protein intake:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total protein intake per week is:
     \[
     6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{42}

"Let's denote the smallest angle in the triangle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the measures of the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's convert all of Colby's coins into their equivalent value in nickels, since each gumball costs a nickel.

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is equal to 5 nickels, 8 quarters are equal to \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime is equal to 2 nickels, 6 dimes are equal to \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which are already in nickels, so that's \(14\) nickels.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since 1 nickel is equal to 5 pennies, 15 pennies are equal to \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels.

Now, let's add up all the nickels Colby has:
\[40 \text{ (from quarters)} + 12 \text{ (from dimes)} + 14 \text{ (from nickels)} + 3 \text{ (from pennies)} = 69 \text{ nickels}\]

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Ruiz in one hour} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we first find out how many pounds Marissa makes in two hours:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Marissa in two hours} = 120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds Marissa makes in one hour by dividing 90 by 2:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Marissa in one hour} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours. Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Ruiz in 12 hours} = 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Marissa in 12 hours} = 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts together gives the total amount of chocolates made by both Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total chocolates made} = 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"To determine how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate his total expenditure over the three days and subtract that from his original amount of $100.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on Monday:**
   Howard spends $8 on Monday.

2. **Calculate the amount spent on Tuesday:**
   On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount spent on Wednesday:**
   On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday.
   \[
   4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount spent over the three days:**
   \[
   8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount of money:**
   Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the remaining amount is:

"First, let's calculate the earnings from the first four hours. Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.

The earnings for the first four hours can be calculated as:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50 \text{ per cup} = 15 \times 4 \times 0.50 = 60 \times 0.50 = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours. Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.

The earnings for the next two hours can be calculated as:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60 \text{ per cup} = 10 \times 2 \times 0.60 = 20 \times 0.60 = \$12.00 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings over the 6 hours:
\[ \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day.

1. **Initial amount of gum:**
   Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum chewed at school:**
   Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours per piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, Jim chews 4 pieces of gum during the school day.

3. **Gum chewed on the way home and after dinner:**
   Jim chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}

"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each day for the remaining four days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
     \[
     6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}

"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more Adam needs to grow to reach the required height of 4 feet:

\[ \text{Height needed to grow} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the height he needs to grow into inches:

\[ \text{Height needed to grow in inches} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches, given that he grows 2 inches per year:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the number of years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster is:

"First, we need to determine how many of the 100 riders can stay upright on the wave. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so the remaining 40% must be men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{40}{100} \times 25 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   \[
   \text{Initial cost} = \$150,000
   \]

2. **Monthly Hanger Rental Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly hanger rental} = \$5000
   \]

3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly fuel cost} = 2 \times \text{Monthly hanger rental} = 2 \times \$5000 = \$10,000
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Maintenance Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly maintenance} = \text{Monthly hanger rental} + \text{Monthly fuel cost} = \$5000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000
   \]

5. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for the first year} = \text{Initial cost} + (\text{Total monthly maintenance} \times 12)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for the first year} = \$150,000 + (\$15,000 \times 12)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for the first year} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{330000}

"To determine the total cooking time for all the food, we need to calculate the individual cooking times for rice, beans, and pork, and then sum them up.

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - Given: It took 30 minutes to cook rice.
   \[
   \text{Time for rice} = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.
   \[
   \text{Time for pork} = \text{Time for rice} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - First, calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
   \[
   \text{Combined time for pork and rice} = \text{Time for pork} + \text{Time for rice} = 50 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   - Then, calculate the cooking time for beans:
   \[
   \text{Time for beans} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Combined time for pork and rice} = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - Sum the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork:
   \[
   \text{Total cooking time} = \text{Time for rice} + \text{Time for beans} + \text{Time for pork} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is:
\[
\boxed{120}

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts compared to a mixture of \( \frac{1}{5} \) pound almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture:
- The cost of \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- The cost of \( \frac{1}{5} \) pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

Thus, the mixture of \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts costs \( \boxed{3} \) dollars more than the mixture of \( \frac{1}{5} \) pound almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts."
"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( s \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( g \) be the number of geese.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Since each sheep and each goose has one head, we can write the first equation as:
\[ s + g = 20 \]

Since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, we can write the second equation as:
\[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 2:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( s + g = 20 \)
2. \( 2s + g = 35 \)

To eliminate \( g \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2s + g - s - g = 15 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( s = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + g = 20 \]
\[ g = 20 - 15 \]
\[ g = 5 \]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the increased cost, we calculate 20% of $5:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 5 = 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:

\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Therefore, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for the week. The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:

\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Additionally, Roger buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost for the coffee and the donut is:

\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{44}

   \[
   \$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00
   \]

5. Subtract the total cost of the chips, fried chicken, and soda from the total amount Gus spent to find the cost of the apple pie:
   \[
   \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
   \]

Thus, the cost of the apple pie is:
\[
\boxed{7.00}

\[ 600 - 407 = 193 \]

So, the number of newspapers delivered to District B is:
\[ \boxed{193} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the cooking class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. Therefore, the weekly class time is:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

The class lasts for 6 weeks, so the total class time is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total class time by the time it takes to learn one recipe:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Thus, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150
\]

Now, we know the amounts of money each person has:
- Rayna: $150
- Kassidy: $90
- Aurelia: $120

To find the total amount of money they have together, we add these amounts:

\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360
\]

If they decide to share the money equally, we divide the total amount by 3:

\[
\text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120
\]

Thus, if they share the money equally, each person would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."

Next, add the additional five minutes that were played due to the tie in the last quarter:

\[ 48 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the entire game lasted:

\[ \boxed{53} \]"
"First, we calculate the number of employees who are management. Since 20% of the 50 employees are management, we perform the following calculation:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. We know that 30% of the management employees oversee the company. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

So, the number of employees who oversee the company is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients Svetlana needs for 16 muffins, we first calculate the amount of each ingredient required for one muffin and then multiply by 16.

1. **Flour:**
   - For one muffin: 5 tablespoons

"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the total number of toys James needs.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - Therefore, James needs to buy \(12 - 4 = 8\) more toys.
   - After buying these toys, James has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.

2. **Second Visit:**
   - When James returns, the number of dogs has doubled from the last count.
   - The number of dogs is now \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - Therefore, James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys.
   - After buying these toys, James has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.

3. **Third Visit:**
   - When James returns again, 3 dogs have left the shelter.

"First, calculate the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack.

Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 \, \text{kg} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Including Jack, the total number of people is 9. Since Jack is also an adult, his weight is also 80 kg. Adding Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults gives:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight exceeds the maximum load by:
\[ \boxed{20 \, \text{kg}} \]"
"Let's define the number of cookies each person has in terms of variables and equations based on the information given.

1. Let \( K \) be the number of cookies Katarina has.
2. Let \( M \) be the number of cookies Max has.
3. Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
4. Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we know:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: \( K = M - 5 \).
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: \( M = C + 12 \).
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: \( S = M + 23 \).
- Katarina has 68 cookies: \( K = 68 \).

First, substitute \( K = 68 \) into the equation \( K = M - 5 \):
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Next, substitute \( M = 73 \) into the equation \( M = C + 12 \):
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Then, substitute \( M = 73 \) into the equation \( S = M + 23 \):
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: \( K = 68 \)
- Max: \( M = 73 \)
- Cookie Monster: \( C = 61 \)
- Summer: \( S = 96 \)

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these values:
\[ K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Calculate the sum step by step:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Thus, the total number of cookies they have is:

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length. This means the length of the dress after the extension is \( x + 0.5x = 1.5x \).

Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the final length of the dress is \( 1.5x + 20 \) cm.

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{80}

John and Jack have a total of 30 minutes to walk to school. If they have already spent 19 minutes walking, the time they have left to get to school is:

\[30 - 19 = 11 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the time John and Jack have left to get to school without being late is:

\[
\boxed{11}
\]"
"To determine the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit separately and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples.
   - The price per kilo of apples is $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of apples is:
     \[
     1 \text{ kilo} \times 4 \text{ dollars/kilo} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas.
   - The price per kilo of bananas is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost of bananas is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times 2 \text{ dollars/kilo} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges.
   - The price per kilo of oranges is $3.
   - Therefore, the cost of oranges is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kilo} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total cost:**
   - Sum the costs of apples, bananas, and oranges:
     \[
     4 \text{ dollars} + 4 \text{ dollars} + 6 \text{ dollars} = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Catherine pays is \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda baked. Since Celinda baked twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta baked 30 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

After baking, the pair ate 10 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left to be put in the box is:

\[ \text{Cookies left} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

So, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of this twin would be \( x + 7 \).

The other triplet is \( x \) years old, and the other twin is also \( x + 7 \) years old. The combined ages of the four individuals are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
x + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[
4x + 14 = 44
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

\[
4x + 14 - 14 = 44 - 14
\]

\[
4x = 30
\]

\[
x = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]

So, the younger triplet is 7.5 years old. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the triplet, is:

\[
x + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5
\]

Thus, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{14.5}\)."
"First, let's convert the total time John has before he has to eat dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend on his homework. He has three subjects to work on:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Adding these times together gives:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, to find out how many minutes John has left for his nap, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 80 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John has 100 minutes to nap. 

**Final Answer:**
\[ 100 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40.

The cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

The cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong, we calculate the additional coins Neil saves as follows:

\[
\text{Additional coins Neil saves} = 20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 8
\]

So, Neil saves:

\[
20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person saves over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months in ten years is:

\[
10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
\]

Now, we calculate the total number of coins Rong saves in 120 months:

\[
20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins}
\]

Similarly, we calculate the total number of coins Neil saves in 120 months:

\[
28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins}
\]

Finally, we add the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil to find the combined total:

\[
2400 + 3360 = 5760
\]

Thus, the total number of coins they have ten years after they started their savings is:

\[
\boxed{5760}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the cost of the heartworm check be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. If the total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, we can express the total bill as:
\[ 40 + x \]

Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can write:
\[ x = 0.6 \times (40 + x) \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 0.6 \times (40 + x) \]
\[ x = 24 + 0.6x \]
\[ x - 0.6x = 24 \]
\[ 0.4x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, the cost of the heartworm check is $60. Now, we can find the total bill:
\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of one banana. We know that one apple costs $0.50 and one banana costs twice as much as one apple. Therefore, the cost of one banana is:
\[ 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange. We know that one orange costs three times as much as one banana. Therefore, the cost of one orange is:
\[ 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the total cost of the bananas in the crate. Since there are 5 bananas in the crate, the total cost of the bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1.00 = 5.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we find the total cost of the apples in the crate. Since there are 12 apples in the crate, the total cost of the apples is:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we find the total cost of the oranges in the crate. Since there are 7 oranges in the crate, the total cost of the oranges is:
\[ 7 \times 3.00 = 21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the bananas, apples, and oranges to find the total cost of the crate:
\[ 5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \boxed{32.00} \]"
"To determine the total number of square feet in Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Number of red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Number of blue squares} = \text{Number of red squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Number of green squares} = \text{Number of blue squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Number of white squares} = \text{Number of green squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Next, we sum the number of all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[
\text{Total number of squares} = \text{Number of red squares} + \text{Number of blue squares} + \text{Number of green squares} + \text{Number of white squares}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares:
\[
\text{Total area} = 68 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter is:
\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. According to the problem, the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[
\text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant:

\[
\text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48
\]

Now, we need to determine the total number of chairs required for the function. The function will have 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of people attending is:

\[
\text{Total number of people} = 42 + 15 = 57
\]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of people attending:

\[
\text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total number of people} - \text{Total current chairs} = 57 - 48 = 9
\]

Thus, Mia needs to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"First, we need to determine the number of bucks in the field. Since 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, we calculate:

\[ 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]

So, there are 25 bucks in the field.

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. We know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]

So, the number of 8 point bucks is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of points each student has collected.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Betty's Points (Recheck):**
   We already calculated Betty's points as 65, so this is consistent.

5. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Next, we sum up the points collected by all students:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points}
\]
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the number of points the class is missing is:
\[
\text{Points needed} = 400 - 255 = 145
\]

Thus, the class is missing \(\boxed{145}\) points to go on the trip."
"To determine the number of great grand-babies at the family reunion, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of children Great Grandma Jones has:**
   Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.

2. **Determine the number of grandchildren each child has:**
   Each of her 3 children has 3 children of their own (grandchildren). Therefore, the total number of grandchildren is:
   \[
   3 \text{ children} \times 3 \text{ grandchildren per child} = 9 \text{ grandchildren}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of great-grandchildren each grandchild has:**

"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She contributes 50% of her $2400 paycheck to her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she spends on her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her paycheck for this:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she spends $480 on her car payment.

Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after these deductions. We start with her total paycheck and subtract the amounts she put into her retirement account and her car payment:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is:

\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"First, determine the number of pencils currently in the box. Since the box has space for 20 pencils and 4 pencils are missing, the number of pencils in the box is:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city. The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. Therefore, the total number of fireworks from the city is:

\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

Hannah's house is at an angle where she can see 40% of the city's fireworks. So, the number of fireworks Hannah can see from the city is:

\[ 300 \times 0.40 = 120 \]

Next, we calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. Hannah sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each. Therefore, the total number of fireworks from Hannah's backyard is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah sees, we add the fireworks she sees from the city to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard:

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat holds one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy 20 drinks and 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

The cost of each drink is $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of each snack is $2, so the total cost for the snacks is:
\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the drinks and the snacks together, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the group has spent a total of:

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Substituting the known values for Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, we get:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Simplifying the left side, we find:

\[ 8800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

To find Gary's truck capacity, we subtract 8800 from 11600:

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 - 8800 = 2800 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of gravel that Gary's truck can carry is:

1. Identify the number of dumplings each female ate.
2. Determine the number of dumplings each male ate.
3. Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females.
4. Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males.
5. Sum the dumplings eaten by the females and the males to get the total number of dumplings cooked.

Let's start with the given information:
- Each female ate 3 dumplings.
- Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.
- There are 8 males and 6 females.

Now, we calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females:
\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings per female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males:
\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings per male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

Finally, we sum the dumplings eaten by the females and the males to get the total number of dumplings cooked:
\[ 18 \text{ dumplings} + 32 \text{ dumplings} = 50 \text{ dumplings} \]

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received based on the ratio 3:2. The total parts of the ratio are \(3 + 2 = 5\).

The total amount of money is $100. To find out how much each part of the ratio represents, we divide $100 by 5:
\[
\frac{100}{5} = 20
\]

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts of the ratio, we multiply 20 by 3:
\[
3 \times 20 = 60
\]

So, Gerald received $60. If Gerald spent $10 on a book, we subtract $10 from his initial amount:
\[
60 - 10 = 50
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Gerald has left is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second. Therefore, the speed of the turtle can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Speed of the turtle} = \frac{\text{Speed of the cat}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula for distance, which is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the speed of the turtle and the time into the formula, we get:

\[
\text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl \(\boxed{120}\) feet in 40 seconds."
"To determine how many additional hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to calculate the remaining amount they need to raise. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. Therefore, the remaining amount is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining $4200, assuming they raise the same amount per hour as they did in the first 3 hours. In the first 3 hours, they raised $2100, so the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise $4200 at a rate of $700 per hour. This is calculated as:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Since they have already fundraised for 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then sum the amounts produced in the given time.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for both types of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream:
  \[
  50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
  \]
- For vanilla ice cream:
  \[
  12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Finally, we sum the total production of both types of ice cream:
\[
2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is:
\[
\boxed{3000}

Next, we sum up the costs of all the items:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount on his total purchase. To find the discount amount:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times 50 = \$5.00

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Next, we need to determine how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, the total number of scoops Erin can get is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy each eat in two weeks.

Two weeks consist of 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Initially, both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, the amount of candy each has left is:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Ginger} \]
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Amy} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount of candy Amy has:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after two weeks, Amy has \(\boxed{14}\) more pieces of candy than Ginger."
"To determine the number of mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the area to be covered:**
   Mr. Boarden wants to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom.
   \[
   \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2 \times 36}{3} = \frac{72}{3} = 24 \text{ sq ft}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of tiles needed per square foot:**
   Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot.

3. **Calculate the total number of tiles needed:**

   \]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need \(\boxed{576}\) mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom."
"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Calculate the total cost of picking blueberries:**
   - The initial cost to go picking is $20.
   - The cost per pound is $1.5.
   - James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.
   - The cost for the blueberries themselves is \( 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost of picking the blueberries is \( \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \).

2. **Calculate the total cost of buying blueberries at the store:**
   - The cost per pound at the store is $2.5.
   - James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.
   - The total cost at the store is \( 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \).

3. **Calculate the savings:**
   - The savings is the difference between the cost of buying at the store and the cost of picking.
   - Savings = Cost at the store - Cost of picking = \( \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \).

- The difference is \(8 - 4 = 4\).

So, Castle bought \(\boxed{4}\) more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps per minute for each foot:
- When her arms are down, her right foot taps at 300 taps per minute and her left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
- When her arms are raised, her right foot taps at 200 taps per minute and her left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.

Next, we need to determine the total time for each condition:
- Helga dances with her arms down for \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes.
- Helga dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes.

Now, we calculate the total taps for each foot during the time her arms are down:
- Right foot: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)

Next, we calculate the total taps for each foot during the time her arms are raised:
- Right foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)

Now, we sum the taps for each foot:
- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150\)

Finally, we sum the taps for both feet:
\[1300 + 1150 = 2450\]

Thus, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of having the city council fix it and the total cost of Ron fixing it himself, then find the difference between these two amounts.

1. **Calculate the cost if the city council fixes the pothole:**
   - The pothole will do $450 worth of damage to Ron's car if it is not fixed.
   - Therefore, the cost if the city council fixes it is $450.

2. **Calculate the cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself:**

First, let's find out how many normal chairs are left:
- Initially, there are 170 normal chairs.
- 20 normal chairs were sent for repair.
- Therefore, the number of normal chairs left is \(170 - 20 = 150\).

Next, let's find out how many baby chairs are left:
- Initially, there are 23 baby chairs.
- 13 baby chairs were sent for repair.
- Therefore, the number of baby chairs left is \(23 - 13 = 10\).

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to get the total number of chairs left:
- The total number of chairs left is \(150 + 10 = 160\).

Thus, the number of chairs the restaurant has left is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:
\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
Since three people ate 8 slices each, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends. Each of these two people ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
Since two people ate 9 slices each, the total number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages, and the dog can do this in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the cat's time.

Calculate the time for the dog:
\[
\text{Time for the dog} = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the times together and then dividing by 2.

Calculate the average time:
\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for the cat} + \text{Time for the dog}}{2} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes from feet and inches to just inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes by \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these 16 cars is:
\[
16 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these 24 cars is:
\[
24 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars:
\[
64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[
\boxed{112}

   \]

2. Calculate the number of blue spools:
   \[
   15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} = 60 \text{ blue spools}
   \]

3. Determine the percentage of blue spools out of the total number of spools:
   \[
   \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
   \]

So, the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue is \(\boxed{40}\)."

1. Determine the number of people who voted by midday.
2. Calculate the number of people remaining after midday.
3. Determine the number of people who voted by 16:00 from the remaining people.
4. Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Number of people who voted by midday:**
   By midday, \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the 5000 people had voted.
   \[
   \text{Number of people who voted by midday} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
   \]

2. **Number of people remaining after midday:**
   The number of people remaining after 2000 people had voted is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining people} = 5000 - 2000 = 3000
   \]

3. **Number of people who voted by 16:00 from the remaining people:**
   By 16:00, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining 3000 people had voted.
   \[
   \text{Number of people who voted by 16:00} = \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
   \]

4. **Number of people who had not voted by 16:00:**
   The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the remaining people after 2000 more had voted.
   \[
   \text{Number of people who had not voted by 16:00} = 3000 - 2000 = 1000
   \]

Thus, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is \(\boxed{1000}\)."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the number of pieces per pack.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days. Since he chews 4 pieces of gum a day, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum are required. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces needed by the number of pieces per pack:

     \]
   - **Adults:** 6 adults each want 1 smore.
     \[
     6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores}
     \]
   - **Total smores needed:**
     \[
     18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores}
     \]

2. **Determine how many smores can be made from one box of graham crackers:**
   - Each sleeve makes 8 smores.
   - There are 3 sleeves in a box.
     \[
     3 \text{ sleeves per box} \times 8 \text{ smores per sleeve} = 24 \text{ smores per box}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**
   - Since one box can make 24 smores and we need 24 smores:
     \[

     \]

Thus, the number of boxes of graham crackers needed is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We do this by adding their individual ages together:

\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

Now, we divide the total amount of money by the total number of people:
\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, each of them gets \(\boxed{5}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the weight of each book:

- Cindy's math books weigh 2 pounds each. Since the problem does not specify the number of math books, we'll assume she has 1 math book for simplicity, making the weight of the math books \(2\) pounds.
- Her science books also weigh 2 pounds each, and again, assuming 1 science book, the weight is \(2\) pounds.
- Her French book weighs \(4\) pounds.
- Her English book weighs \(3\) pounds.
- Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all the books together:

\[
2 \text{ (math)} + 2 \text{ (science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is \(\boxed{17}\) pounds."
"First, let's determine how many votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we calculate:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{50% of candidate A's votes} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Thus, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we calculate Beck's apples as follows:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of ice cube.

1. **Giant Cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) ounces.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \( 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \) ounces.

Next, we sum the total water used for all the ice cubes:
\[ 12 \text{ ounces (giant cubes)} + 14 \text{ ounces (medium cubes)} + 4 \text{ ounces (small cubes)} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of books each person has and then find the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has.

1. **Determine the number of books Steven has:**
   - Clara has two times as many books as Steven.
   - Clara has 20 books.
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.
   - Therefore, \( 2S = 20 \).
   - Solving for \( S \):
     \[
     S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
     \]
   - Steven has 10 books.

2. **Determine the number of books Alice has:**
   - Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
   - Steven has 10 books.
   - Let \( A \) represent the number of books Alice has.
   - Therefore, \( A = 10 + 6 \).
   - Solving for \( A \):
     \[
     A = 16
     \]
   - Alice has 16 books.

3. **Determine how many more books Clara has than Alice:**
   - Clara has 20 books.
   - Alice has 16 books.
   - The difference in the number of books is:
     \[
     20 - 16 = 4
     \]

Thus, Clara has \(\boxed{4}\) more books than Alice."
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[
\text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. The cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[
10 \times 5 = 50
\]

The cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[

"First, we need to determine how many birds Jeremy scared away. He initially saw 12 birds, and he scared away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of them. We calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 12 as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

So, 4 birds were scared away. This means the number of birds remaining after the stone was thrown is:

\[
12 - 4 = 8
\]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:

\[
8 + 20 = 28

"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students in each class:**
   Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of girls in each class:**
   We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, we calculate 40% of 40:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of boys in each class:**
   Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the number of boys in each class is:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24

"First, let's determine how many marbles Cal has. We know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Cal has:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Carl has. We know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Total marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

"First, we determine how many students are in each of the six groups when fifty-four students are divided equally among them. This is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{54}{6} = 9
\]

So, each of the six groups has 9 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for each of the 12 groups if the activity requires 12 groups. Let \( x \) be the number of students per group in the 12 groups. Since the total number of students remains the same (54), we have:

\[
12 \times x = 54
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5
\]

This means each of the 12 groups would need 4.5 students. However, since the number of students per group must be a whole number, and we are only asked how many more groups are needed, we focus on the number of groups.

Currently, there are 6 groups. To find out how many more groups are needed to make a total of 12 groups, we subtract the number of existing groups from the required number of groups:

\[
12 - 6 = 6
\]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single week:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

So, the number of chairs rented during the weekdays in one week is:
\[ 60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ chairs} \]

And the number of chairs rented during the weekend in one week is:
\[ 100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ chairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of chairs rented in one week is:
\[ 300 \text{ chairs} + 200 \text{ chairs} = 500 \text{ chairs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are rented in two 4-week months. Since there are 8 weeks in two 4-week months, we multiply the weekly total by 8:
\[ 500 \text{ chairs/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 4000 \text{ chairs} \]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bananas Gunther has in the end.

1. **Initial number of bananas:**
   Gunther starts with 48 bananas.
   \[
   \text{Initial bananas} = 48
   \]

2. **Arnold steals half of the bananas:**
   Arnold steals half of the 48 bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, the number of bananas left with Gunther is:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24
   \]

3. **Gunther adds 25 more bananas:**
   Gunther adds 25 bananas to the remaining 24 bananas.
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49
   \]

4. **Arnold steals 12 more bananas:**
   Arnold steals 12 bananas from the 49 bananas.
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37
   \]

5. **Gunther adds 6 more bananas:**
   Gunther adds 6 more bananas to the 37 bananas.

"To determine how much each of Jenna's roommates will pay per year for electricity, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the monthly share for each roommate:**
   The total monthly electricity bill is $100. Since there are 5 people (Jenna and her 4 roommates) sharing the bill equally, we divide the total bill by the number of people:
   \[
   \text{Monthly share per person} = \frac{100}{5} = 20
   \]

2. **Calculate the annual share for each roommate:**
   There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the monthly share by 12 to find the annual share:
   \[
   \text{Annual share per person} = 20 \times 12 = 240
   \]

Thus, each roommate will pay \(\boxed{240}\) dollars per year for electricity."
"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent for the event.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. Since one dozen equals 12, we can calculate the total number of glasses and plates as follows:

\[
8 \text{ dozen glasses} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
\]
\[
4 \text{ dozen plates} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates}
\]

Next, we need to account for the items that were broken. According to the problem, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. Therefore, we subtract these broken items from the initial totals:

\[
\text{Remaining glasses} = 96 - 10 = 86
\]
\[
\text{Remaining plates} = 48 - 6 = 42
\]

Finally, we add the remaining glasses and plates to find the total number of items Jeff has now:

\[
86 \text{ glasses} + 42 \text{ plates} = 128 \text{ items}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{128}

"To solve the problem, we need to follow the trades step by step and calculate the number of buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = \(\frac{27}{3} = 9\) large buttons.
   - After trading, she has \(40 + 9 = 49\) large buttons and \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers.
   - 50% of 49 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 49 = 24.5\). Since the number of stickers must be an integer, we assume she trades 24 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, so 24 large stickers = \(24 \times 3 = 72\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 72 small stickers = 72 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 72 small buttons = \(\frac{72}{3} = 24\) large buttons.
   - After trading, she has \(49 - 24 = 25\) large buttons and \(3 + 72 = 75\) small stickers.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 25 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, so 25 large stickers = \(25 \times 3 = 75\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 75 small stickers = 75 small buttons.
   - After trading, she has \(75 + 75 = 150\) small buttons.

5. **Final Count of Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 150 small buttons.

Thus, the final number of buttons Lorraine has is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day.

1. On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
2. On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
3. On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we sum the matches played on each day:
\[
2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7
\]

Thus, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is given as 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into this expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order.

1. **Extra-Small Shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of small shirts = \(2 \times 11 = 22\).

3. **Medium Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = \(22 - 4 = 18\).

4. **Large Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).

5. **Extra-Large Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed:
\[
11 \text{ (extra-small)} + 22 \text{ (small)} + 18 \text{ (medium)} + 9 \text{ (large)} + 15 \text{ (extra-large)} = 75

"To find out how much you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 bag, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of the discount.
2. Subtract the discount from the original price.

**Step 1: Calculate the discount amount.**

The discount is 5% of $140. To find 5% of $140, multiply $140 by 0.05 (since 5% = 5/100 = 0.05).

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \]

**Step 2: Subtract the discount from the original price.**

Subtract the discount amount from the original price of $140.

\[ \text{Final price} = 140 - 7 = 133 \]

So, the final amount you will pay after the discount is \(\boxed{133}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

"First, let's determine how many people think horse #2 will win the race. Since 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. This means the remaining number of people is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. Since 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. This means the number of people who think horse #12 will win is the remaining people after accounting for those who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

So, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

\]

Next, we add the money Jayden originally had to the money Ava gave him to find out how much money Jayden has in total:

\[
70 + 45 = 115
\]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more money Jayden needs to buy the camera, we subtract the total amount of money Jayden has from the cost of the camera:

\[
200 - 115 = 85
\]

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house, which is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need \(\boxed{142.86}\) cases of shingles."

"To determine how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold.
2. Calculate the total number of fruity scents sold.
3. Find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold.

First, we calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold:
- They sell 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents.
- Therefore, the total number of vanilla scents sold is \(5 \times 4 = 20\).

Next, we calculate the total number of fruity scents sold:
- They sell 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents.
- Therefore, the total number of fruity scents sold is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).

Now, we find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:
- The difference is \(20 - 16 = 4\).

Thus, the number of vanilla scents sold is 4 more than the number of fruity scents sold. 

The final answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Bennet makes from selling 20 eggplants at $3 each.

\[ 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3/\text{eggplant} = \$60 \]

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more money he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the money he has already made from the total amount he wants to make.

\[ \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount of money he needs to make from the corn by the number of ears of corn.

\[ \$75 \div 25 \text{ ears} = \$3/\text{ear} \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has available over the weekend:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that she spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time is:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Tatiana plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining 9 hours:

"To determine the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked separately, and then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance hiked. The family hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. The driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so half of this speed is:
\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour}
\]
Thus, the hiking speed is:
\[
25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour}
\]
The distance hiked is:
\[
1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles per hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance driven. The total time spent traveling (driving and hiking) is 6 hours, and they hiked for 1.5 hours, so the time spent driving is:
\[
6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours}
\]
The driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so the distance driven is:
\[
4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles per hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
\]

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[
225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance to the vacation spot is:
\[
\boxed{255}

"To determine the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we need to break down the scoring system and the given information step by step.

1. **Points for Enemies:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
   - Points for each enemy = 10 points.
   - Let \( E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
   - Then, Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
   - Points from enemies for Emma = \( 10E \).
   - Points from enemies for Ava = \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \).

2. **Points for Berries:**
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
   - Points for each berry = 5 points.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
   - Then, Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Points from berries for Emma = \( 5B \).
   - Points from berries for Ava = \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \).

3. **Points for Time:**
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.
   - Points for each second left on the timer = 30 points.
   - Let \( T \) be the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes.
   - Then, Ava has \( T + 4 \) seconds left.
   - Points from time for Emma = \( 30T \).
   - Points from time for Ava = \( 30(T + 4) = 30T + 120 \).

4. **Total Scores:**
   - Total score for Emma = \( 10E + 5B + 30T \).
   - Total score for Ava = \( 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T + 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T + 155 \).

5. **Difference in Scores:**
   - Difference = Total score for Ava - Total score for Emma
   - Difference = \( (10E + 5B + 30T + 155) - (10E + 5B + 30T) \)
   - Simplifying, the terms \( 10E + 5B + 30T \) cancel out.
   - Difference = \( 155 \).

Thus, the difference between their two scores is \(\boxed{155}\)."

   - Number of rides on usual days = \(3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}\).

2. **Calculate the number of rides on the special days:**
   - On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual time, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) rides per day.
   - Number of rides on special days = \(6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}\).

3. **Calculate the total number of rides in a week:**
   - Total rides = Rides on usual days + Rides on special days = \(15 + 12 = 27\).

Thus, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

We also know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we have:
\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method. First, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( W \):
\[ 2O + 2W = 34 \]

Now we have:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( 2O + 2W = 34 \)

Adding these two equations together eliminates \( W \):
\[ (O - 2W) + (2O + 2W) = 5 + 34 \]
\[ 3O = 39 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

Now that we have \( O = 13 \), we can substitute this value back into the second original equation to find \( W \):
\[ O + W = 17 \]
\[ 13 + W = 17 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"To determine how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money needed for the trip.
2. Determine how much the school will contribute.
3. Calculate how much John still needs to raise after accounting for the school's contribution.

First, the total cost of the trip is $300. The school will cover half of this cost:
\[
\text{School's contribution} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
\]

Next, we need to find out how much John still needs to raise after the school's contribution. John has already $50, so we need to subtract the school's contribution and John's current amount from the total cost:
\[
\text{Amount John needs to raise} = 300 - 150 - 50 = 100
\]

Therefore, the amount of money John is missing is:

"First, we need to determine the temperature during the night. If it is 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Therefore, we need to find out how many degrees the temperature needs to be raised from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. This can be calculated as:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood burns and raises the temperature by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees is:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Thus, the number of logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month.
2. Determine the total value of these bottle caps.

First, we know that Damien finds 10 bottle caps each day. Over a 30-day month, the total number of bottle caps he finds is:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps} \]

Next, we know that each bottle cap is worth $0.25. Therefore, the total value of 300 bottle caps is:
\[ 300 \text{ bottle caps} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/bottle cap} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month is:
\[
\boxed{75}

"First, let's determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and the special hourly rate for additional hours.

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

The special hourly rate for additional hours is 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find this, we calculate:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 20 = 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Jamie was paid for her 11 hours of work on Tuesday. Since she worked 8 hours at her regular rate and 3 hours at the special rate, we can break it down as follows:

1. Calculate the pay for the first 8 hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars per hour} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

2. Calculate the pay for the additional 3 hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars per hour} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Add the two amounts together to find the total pay for the day:
\[ 160 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Jamie was paid for her work on Tuesday is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of female lions.
2. Calculate the number of male lions.
3. Identify the number of lion cubs.
4. Sum the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs.

First, we know there are 12 female lions.

Next, we calculate the number of male lions. The problem states that there are half as many male lions as female lions. Therefore, the number of male lions is:
\[
\frac{12}{2} = 6
\]

We are also given that there are 14 lion cubs.

Now, we sum the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs:
\[
12 + 6 + 14 = 32
\]

Thus, the total number of lions in the enclosure is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised at 25% off.

To find the discount amount:
\[
\text{Discount} = 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[
\text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30
\]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price from the amount he paid:
\[
\text{Change} = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Mike will have left over is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.
2. Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
3. Compute the total monthly salary for all employees.
4. Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months to get the total amount paid over three months.

**Step 1: Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.**

The initial number of employees is 200. After hiring 60 new employees, the total number of employees is:
\[ 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 3: Compute the total monthly salary for all employees.**

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary for 260 employees is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months to get the total amount paid over three months.**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ \boxed{3120000} \]"
"To determine the total time Carrie's choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the time for each song and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total time for singing ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long.
- The choir will sing it twice.

\[
150 \text{ seconds/song} \times 2 \text{ songs} = 300 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, we calculate the time for singing ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.
- The choir will sing it once.

\[
240 \text{ seconds/song} \times 1 \text{ song} = 240 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we add the total time for both songs to find the overall caroling time:

\[
300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time the choir will be caroling is:

\[
\boxed{540}

"First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at different points in time:

1. **Billy's starting hourly wage:**
   \[
   \text{Starting wage} = \$10 \text{ per hour}
   \]

2. **After 2 months, Billy's wage is increased by $0.50:**
   \[
   \text{Wage after 2 months} = 10 + 0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
   \]

3. **On his first anniversary, Billy's wage is increased by $1.00:**
   \[
   \text{Wage on first anniversary} = 10.50 + 1.00 = \$11.50 \text{ per hour}
   \]

Next, we calculate Sally's starting hourly wage, which is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage:
\[
\text{Sally's starting wage} = 10 + 0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
\]

Now, we calculate the earnings for both Billy and Sally over 20 hours of work:

1. **Billy's earnings:**
   \[
   \text{Billy's earnings} = 11.50 \times 20 = \$230
   \]

2. **Sally's earnings:**
   \[
   \text{Sally's earnings} = 10.50 \times 20 = \$210
   \]

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
\[
\text{Difference} = 230 - 210 = \$20
\]

Thus, Billy earns \(\boxed{20}\) dollars more than Sally."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 3 loaves of bread. Each loaf costs $2, so:

\[ 3 \text{ loaves} \times \$2/\text{loaf} = \$6 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of 2 bagels. Each bagel costs $1, so:

\[ 2 \text{ bagels} \times \$1/\text{bagel} = \$2 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the 3 loaves of bread cost compared to the 2 bagels. We do this by subtracting the total cost of the bagels from the total cost of the bread:

\[ \$6 - \$2 = \$4 \]

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine how many points Nikita scored. According to the problem, Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. Pierson scored 278 points.

To find half of Pierson's points:
\[
\frac{278}{2} = 139
\]

Next, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's points:
\[
139 + 11 = 150
\]

Now, we need to find the total points scored by both Pierson and Nikita. We add Pierson's points to Nikita's points:
\[
278 + 150 = 428
\]

Thus, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[
\boxed{428}
\]"
"To determine the total number of trees planted at the end of the reforestation campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- Each class has 25 students.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(25 \times 40 = 1000\).
- Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is 1000.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \(3 \times 40 = 120\).
- Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is \(120 \times 2 = 240\).

Now, we sum the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers:
- The total number of trees planted is \(1000 + 240 = 1240\).

Thus, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is \(\boxed{1240}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Adding these together gives:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by \( 14 + x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Distribute the 0.30 on the right side:
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy \(\boxed{6}\) stuffed goats."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks (14 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the first 2 weeks} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours she plays in the second part of her schedule. She plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week (7 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the second week} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we add the hours from both parts of her schedule to find the total hours she has played so far.

\[ \text{Total hours played} = 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours.

\[ \text{Hours still needed} = 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: \(60\) miles per hour
   - Time: \(2\) hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: \(70\) miles per hour
   - Time: \(2\) hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Determine the separation between the two cars:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: \(140\) miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: \(120\) miles
   - Separation = Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car
   \[
   \text{Separation} = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, the number of miles that will separate the two cars after 2 hours is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the materials before the premium is added. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. Adding these together gives:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original total cost of the materials to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final amount James paid is:

\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then find the pass rate as a percentage.

First, let's determine the number of students who passed in each grade:

1. **Third Graders:**
   - Number of third-graders: 500
   - Number of third-graders who passed: 340

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - Number of fourth-graders: 100
   - Number of fourth-graders who passed: 40

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - Number of fifth-graders: 400
   - Pass rate for fifth graders: Twice the fourth graders' pass rate
   - Fourth graders' pass rate: \(\frac{40}{100} = 0.4\) or 40%
   - Fifth graders' pass rate: \(2 \times 0.4 = 0.8\) or 80%
   - Number of fifth-graders who passed: \(0.8 \times 400 = 320\)

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total number of students who passed:
  \[
  340 \text{ (third-graders)} + 40 \text{ (fourth-graders)} + 320 \text{ (fifth-graders)} = 680
  \]

- Total number of students:
  \[
  500 \text{ (third-graders)} + 100 \text{ (fourth-graders)} + 400 \text{ (fifth-graders)} = 1000
  \]

Now, we find the overall pass rate:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \left( \frac{680}{1000} \right) \times 100\% = 68\%
\]

Thus, the school's overall pass rate is \(\boxed{68\%}\)."

"Dale initially planned to sell 100 butterscotch candies. He ended up selling 150 candies and then ordered 100 more. To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of candies Dale has after his second order:
   \[
   150 \text{ (sold)} + 100 \text{ (ordered)} = 250 \text{ candies}
   \]

2. Since Dale initially only planned to sell 100 candies, the number of candies he still needs to sell is:
   \[

   \]

Therefore, the number of candies Dale still needs to sell is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern of the student population. The number of students doubles at the end of every month. Let's break down the growth month by month starting from the beginning of the year.

1. **Beginning of the year (January 1st):** There are 10 students.
2. **End of January:** The number of students doubles, so there are \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students.
3. **End of February:** The number of students doubles again, so there are \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students.
4. **End of March:** The number of students doubles again, so there are \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students.
5. **End of April:** The number of students doubles again, so there are \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students.
6. **End of May:** The number of students doubles again, so there are \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students.

Now, we need to find out how many additional students have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year. The number of students at the beginning of the year is 10, and by the end of May, there are 320 students. The additional number of students is:

"To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of branches climbed during the week:**
   - Felix charges $0.25 per branch.
   - He made $105 during the week.
   - Therefore, the total number of branches climbed is:
     \[
     \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Charge per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
     \]

2. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{105}{0.25} = 105 \div 0.25 = 105 \times 4 = 420
   \]
   So, Felix climbed 420 branches during the week.

3. **Calculate the average number of branches climbed per day:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the average number of branches climbed per day is:
     \[
     \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7}
     \]

4. **Perform the division:**

Thus, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

1. **First batch of flowers:**
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. **Second batch of flowers:**
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. **Third batch of flowers:**
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. **Fourth batch of flowers:**
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Next, we sum these totals to find the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

Rose drops 1 flower from each batch. We need to determine the number of petals on these dropped flowers:
- 1 flower from the first batch: 5 petals
- 1 flower from the second batch: 6 petals
- 1 flower from the third batch: 4 petals
- 1 flower from the fourth batch: 7 petals

Summing the petals of the dropped flowers:
\[
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they use:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we need to account for the 3 marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows that are no longer available is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Initially, there were 35 marshmallows in the bag. After using 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Therefore, each kid can have \(\boxed{7}\) S'mores."
"To determine how much money Jack and his friends use, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then convert that into the number of quarters used.

First, let's break down the time each person can play:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
- Two of Jack's friends can play for half as long as Jack, so each of them can play for \(20 / 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
- One of Jack's friends can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so this friend can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

Next, we calculate the total time each person plays in 4 hours (which is 240 minutes):
- Jack plays for 240 minutes.
- Each of the two friends who play for 10 minutes per quarter plays for 240 minutes, so each of them plays \(240 / 10 = 24\) quarters.
- The friend who plays for 30 minutes per quarter plays for 240 minutes, so this friend plays \(240 / 30 = 8\) quarters.

Now, we calculate the total number of quarters used:
- Jack plays for 240 minutes, so he uses \(240 / 20 = 12\) quarters.
- The two friends who play for 10 minutes each use 24 quarters each, so together they use \(24 + 24 = 48\) quarters.
- The friend who plays for 30 minutes uses 8 quarters.

Adding these together, the total number of quarters used is:
\[12 + 48 + 8 = 68\]

Thus, the total amount of money used is \(\boxed{68}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil in ounces.
- According to the problem, the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so \( o = 2s \).
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so \( s = 2z \).

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients, which is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ o + z + z + s + s = 10 \]
Substituting \( o = 2s \) and \( s = 2z \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 2s + z + z + s + s = 10 \]
\[ 2(2z) + z + z + 2z + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 4z + z + z + 2z + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]
Now that we know \( z = 1 \), we can find \( s \) and \( o \):
\[ s = 2z = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]
\[ o = 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]
So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{4}\) ounces."
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.

\[
\text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \times 500 = 1500
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.

\[
\text{Total cost of cows} = 2 \times 1500 = 3000
\]

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:

\[

"To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we start by calculating the total number of cupcakes he already has. Paul has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. Adding these together gives:

\[ 8 + 40 = 48 \]

Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. To find out how many more cupcakes he needs to buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes required:

\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

Therefore, Paul should buy \(\boxed{15}\) more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. According to the problem, Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate 20% of 40:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving away the cars. Initially, Joe had 40 cars. After selling 8 cars and giving away 16 cars, the number of cars he has left is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money came from the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they collectively raised $125,000. So, the amount raised by each student is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day.
2. Add the time walked on both days to get the total time.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the time walked on both days to find the total time:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we convert the total time from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total hours by 60:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"

\]

Therefore, Kimberly bought \(\boxed{52}\) more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we isolate \( P \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Then, we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, the number of cards Becca has is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"

1. **Green Eggs:**
   Cindy had 5 green eggs.

2. **Blue Eggs:**
   Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green ones. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Pink Eggs:**
   Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9
   \]

4. **Yellow Eggs:**
   Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

Thus, the total number of eggs Cindy had is:
\[

   \]
   Converting minutes to hours:
   \[
   90 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours/week}
   \]
   For four weeks:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Time spent recording videos:**
   Britany records 18 4-minute videos each week.

"First, let's break down the costs based on the information provided:

1. The base installation cost includes:
   - Hanging 4 mirrors
   - 2 shelves
   - 1 chandelier
   - 10 pictures

2. The base installation cost is $129.00.

3. Additional items cost $15.00 per item.

Now, let's calculate the additional items Angela needs installed:

- Angela needs 6 mirrors, but the base installation already includes 4 mirrors. Therefore, she needs an additional 2 mirrors.
- Angela needs 2 chandeliers, and the base installation includes 1 chandelier. Therefore, she needs an additional 1 chandelier.
- Angela needs 20 pictures, and the base installation includes 10 pictures. Therefore, she needs an additional 10 pictures.

Next, we calculate the cost for the additional items:

- Cost for 2 additional mirrors: \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars
- Cost for 1 additional chandelier: \(1 \times 15 = 15\) dollars
- Cost for 10 additional pictures: \(10 \times 15 = 150\) dollars

Now, we add the additional costs to the base installation cost:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway, given their speed relative to that of the kangaroos.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, the total distance \(D\) can be expressed as:
\[ D = 3 \times \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 18 \]
Let the speed of one kangaroo be \(v\). Then the distance \(D\) is:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Next, we need to determine the speed of the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance \(D = 54v\). Let \(t\) be the time it takes for the four turtles to travel this distance. The distance traveled by the four turtles is:
\[ D = 4 \times \text{speed of one turtle} \times t = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} \times t = 2vt \]
Since the distance \(D\) is the same, we can set the two expressions for \(D\) equal to each other:
\[ 54v = 2vt \]
Solving for \(t\), we get:
\[ t = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \]

Therefore, it will take the four turtles \(\boxed{27}\) hours to travel across the highway."
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we start by defining the number of dishes each person makes based on the information given.

   \text{Kora's dishes} = 20
   \]

2. **Rory's Dishes:**
   Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora.
   \[
   \text{Rory's dishes} = \text{Kora's dishes} + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Jada's Dishes:**
   Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory.
   \[
   \text{Jada's dishes} = 2 \times \text{Rory's dishes} = 2 \times 40 = 80

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the reduced price of the laptop after the trade-in.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom.
3. Use the information that she still needs $50 to find out how much she already has.

First, the reduced price of the laptop after the trade-in is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). According to the problem, the total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom, is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

We know that after adding this total amount to the $50 she still needs, she will have enough to buy the laptop. Therefore, the total amount of money she has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

"First, let's determine the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces with his 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, with 3 cows, the total milk production is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk he needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the desired production:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many more cows are required to produce the additional 10 liters of milk:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( J_s \) be the number of socks Jack has.
- Let \( J_d \) be the number of dishes Jack has.
- Let \( P_s \) be the number of socks Peter has.
- Let \( P_d \) be the number of dishes Peter has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jack collected 60 dishes, so \( J_d = 60 \).
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so \( J_d = 2J_s \). Since \( J_d = 60 \), we can substitute to find \( J_s \):
   \[
   60 = 2J_s \implies J_s = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]
   So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so \( P_s = 2J_s = 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so \( P_d = \frac{J_d}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \).

Now, we need to find the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Total socks = \( J_s + P_s = 30 + 60 = 90 \)
- Total dishes = \( J_d + P_d = 60 + 30 = 90 \)

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:
\[
90 + 90 = 180
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{180}
\]"
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the given information and categorize the students accordingly.

1. **Students good at math only**: 5 students
2. **Students good at English only**: 8 students
3. **Students good at both math and English**: Let's denote this number as \( x \).

The total number of students in the class is 20. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students:

\[
5 \text{ (math only)} + 8 \text{ (English only)} + x \text{ (both)} = 20
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
5 + 8 + x = 20
\]

\[
13 + x = 20
\]

\[
x = 20 - 13
\]

\[
x = 7
\]

So, there are 7 students who are good at both math and English.

To find the total number of students who are good at math (including those who are good at both math and English), we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

\[
5 \text{ (math only)} + 7 \text{ (both)} = 12
\]

Thus, the number of students who are good at math is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such groups can fit into the 2-hour concert duration, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group takes:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. We need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Available time for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Now, we can determine how many groups can perform in the available time:
- Number of groups = Available time for groups / Time per group = 110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years with a simple interest scheme, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the principal amount (P), the interest rate (r), and the time period (t).
2. Use the simple interest formula: \( \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \).
3. Calculate the total amount after 3 years using the formula: \( \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Simple Interest} \).

Given:
- Principal amount (P) = $300
- Annual interest rate (r) = three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \) or 2.25 in decimal form.
- Time period (t) = 3 years

First, calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 = 300 \times 6.75 = 2025 \]

Next, calculate the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 = 2325 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{2325} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons, and then find the difference between these two quantities.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars:
- The total number of white shirts is 40.
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

Next, let's find the number of floral shirts with no buttons:
- The total number of floral shirts is 50.
- 20 of the floral shirts have buttons, so the number of floral shirts with no buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:
- The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30.
- The number of white shirts with no collars is 20.
- The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Thus, there are \(\boxed{10}\) more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars."
"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer will use to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the farmer will earn \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs of shoes to find the average cost per pair.

First, we know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs of shoes:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

1. **Calculate the cost of the green food:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
   - Total cost for green food = \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the red food with the discount:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
   - Each basket of red food has a $2 discount.
   - Discount per basket of red food = $2.
   - Total discount for 3 baskets of red food = \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for red food after discount = \( 3 \times 18 - 6 = 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost for green food = $75.
   - Total cost for red food = $48.
   - Total cost for all baskets = \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is:
\[
\boxed{123}

"To determine how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned:**
   \[
   \text{Number of rooms to be cleaned} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
   \]

2. **Determine the time required to clean one room:**
   \[
   \text{Time to clean one room} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time required to clean 45 rooms:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we will calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. **First Year:**
   The town will build 12 homes.

2. **Second Year:**
   The town will build three times the number of homes built in the first year.
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ homes}
   \]

3. **Third Year:**
   The town will build double the total number of homes built in the first two years.
   First, we calculate the total number of homes built in the first two years:
   \[
   12 + 36 = 48 \text{ homes}
   \]
   Then, we double this total:
   \[
   2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ homes}
   \]

4. **Total Number of Homes Built Over Three Years:**
   We sum the homes built each year:

Thus, the total number of homes the town will have built over the next three years is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals mentioned in the problem:
- Let \( I \) be your age.
- Let \( B \) be your brother's age.
- Let \( S \) be your sister's age.
- Let \( M \) be your mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( I = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( I = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( I + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) and \( M \) in terms of \( I \):
- From \( I = B - 3 \), we get \( B = I + 3 \).
- From \( I = S + 2 \), we get \( S = I - 2 \).
- Substitute \( B = I + 3 \) into \( M = 3B - 1 \): \( M = 3(I + 3) - 1 = 3I + 9 - 1 = 3I + 8 \).

Now substitute \( B \), \( S \), and \( M \) into the sum of their ages:
\[ I + (I + 3) + (I - 2) + (3I + 8) = 87. \]
Combine like terms:
\[ I + I + 3 + I - 2 + 3I + 8 = 87, \]
\[ 6I + 9 = 87. \]
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6I = 78. \]
Divide by 6:
\[ I = 13. \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for the class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate the total number of glue sticks as follows:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure he has enough glue sticks for all the students and has some extra glue sticks left over.

Therefore, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[
\boxed{7}

"To solve the problem, we need to follow the changes in the amount of water passing through the river step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After the First Day:**
   After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles.
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After the Third Day:**
   On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons.
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern of the infection. Each infected person infects six others each day.

Let's break it down day by day:

**Day 0:**
- Initially, 10 people are infected.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections on Day 1 = \(10 \times 6 = 60\).
- Total infected after Day 1 = \(10 + 60 = 70\).

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections on Day 2 = \(70 \times 6 = 420\).
- Total infected after Day 2 = \(70 + 420 = 490\).

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections on Day 3 = \(490 \times 6 = 2940\).
- Total infected after Day 3 = \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[
40 \times 20 = 800
\]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[
0.10 \times 800 = 80
\]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total:

\[
800 - 80 = 720
\]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals:

\[
800 + 720 = 1520
\]

Thus, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

\[
\boxed{1520}

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is \(12 - 9 = 3\).

**Jennifer remained with 3 oranges.**"
"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. Therefore, in a year (which has 12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge. Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Thus, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the number of banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, the total number of loaves is:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of gold coins and the relationship between the number of gold and silver coins.
2. Calculate the number of silver coins.
3. Sum the number of gold and silver coins to find the total number of coins.

Given:
- Gretchen has 70 gold coins.
- There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \).

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can write the equation:
\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find the number of silver coins, we solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, we know Gretchen has 70 gold coins and 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold and silver coins together:
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 \]
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 110 \]

Thus, the total number of coins Gretchen has is:
\[
\boxed{110}

   \[
   500 \text{ burritos (students)} + 20 \text{ burritos (Mr. George)} = 520 \text{ burritos}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of leftover burritos:**
   - George ordered 600 burritos.
   - Total burritos consumed is 520.
   \[
   600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos}

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The electronics seller gives the seller $4000. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the $4000:
\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

Therefore, the seller will give back \(\boxed{500}\) dollars in change."
"First, we need to determine how much Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the total cost. We calculate Keenan's share as follows:

\[ 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400 and there are 4 weeks in the month, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. We do this by dividing Keenan's monthly cost by 4:

\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

So, the amount Keenan spends per week is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the first day:**
   Tobias ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces.
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
   \]
   So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

2. **Calculate the number of pieces remaining after the first day:**
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36
   \]
   So, 36 pieces remain after the first day.

3. **Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the second day:**
   Tobias ate 10 pieces on the second day.
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26
   \]
   So, 26 pieces remain after the second day.

4. **Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the third day:**
   Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces.

   - Seven bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of soda is:
     \[
     \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \text{ dollars per bottle}
     \]

2. **Cost per bottle of water:**
   - Four bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of water is:
     \[
     \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \text{ dollars per bottle}
     \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

3. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda:**
   - Each bottle of soda costs $3.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 3 bottles is:
     \[
     3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total cost for 2 bottles of water:**
   - Each bottle of water costs $2.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 bottles is:
     \[
     2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

5. **Total cost:**
   \[
   9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is:
\[
\boxed{13.00}

"To determine how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Next, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from David's initial amount of money. David starts with $12.48, so:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money David has left after buying the bolts is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"To determine how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking, we first need to find out her hourly rate of earning.

1. Calculate the hourly rate:
   \[
   \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Total hours}} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

2. Use the hourly rate to find out how much she would earn in 12 hours:
   \[
   \text{Earnings for 12 hours} = \text{Hourly rate} \times 12 = 11 \times 12 = 132
   \]

Therefore, Ella would earn \(\boxed{132}\) dollars after 12 hours."
"First, we need to determine the total number of marbles Paul has after his friend gave him 28 marbles. Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. After receiving 28 more marbles, the total number of marbles Paul has is:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul loses \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he loses, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

So, Paul loses 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract the 20 marbles he lost from his total of 80 marbles:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Paul has left is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:**
   Isaias plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
   \]

2. **Determine the total revenue from selling the chickens:**
   Isaias sells each chicken for $50.
   \[
   180 \text{ chickens} \times 50 \text{ dollars per chicken} = 9000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit Isaias makes:**
   Isaias makes a profit of $2000.
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} - \text{Cost of chickens} = \text{Profit}
   \]
   Let \( C \) be the total cost of the chickens.
   \[
   9000 - C = 2000
   \]

4. **Solve for the cost of the chickens:**
   \[
   C = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Isaias bought the chickens for is \(\boxed{7000}\)."
"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah and Mitchell sold in total. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sales were 32 glasses, the boys together sold:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \text{ glasses} \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses equally between the two:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ glasses each} \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold \(\boxed{5}\) more glasses than Micah."
"First, let's determine how much Iris spent on each service.

1. **Hair Treatment Cost:**
   Iris spent $400 on her hair treatment.

2. **Manicure Cost:**
   Iris spent \(\frac{1}{4}\) as much on a manicure as she did on her hair treatment. Therefore, the cost of the manicure is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Pedicure Cost:**
   Iris spent \(\frac{3}{4}\) as much on a pedicure as she did on a manicure. Therefore, the cost of the pedicure is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we sum up the costs of all the services to find the total amount spent at the spa:
\[
400 \text{ (hair)} + 100 \text{ (manicure)} + 75 \text{ (pedicure)} = 575 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will earn from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and she can sell it for $2 per meter.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{\$/meter} = 40 \, \text{\$} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and we assume Sarah buys a rope of the same length (20 meters).

\[ \text{Cost of new rope} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{\$/meter} = 30 \, \text{\$} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from Sarah's total earnings to find out how much money she will have left over.

\[ \text{Money left over} = 40 \, \text{\$} - 30 \, \text{\$} = 10 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, we can find her current age by subtracting 10 from 18:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be 24. Since she is currently 8 years old, in \( x \) years, her age will be \( 8 + x \). We set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by subtracting 8 from both sides:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items she is purchasing and then subtract this total from her budget of $65.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon:
- Kelly buys 5 packs of bacon, and the total cost for the bacon is $10.
- Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is:
  \[
  \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chicken:
- Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
- Therefore, the cost per packet of chicken is:
  \[
  2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
  \]
- Kelly buys 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for the chicken is:
  \[
  6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the strawberries:
- Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
- Kelly buys 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for the strawberries is:
  \[
  3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the apples:
- Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
- Therefore, the cost per pack of apples is:
  \[
  \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
  \]
- Kelly buys 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for the apples is:
  \[
  7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget to find out how much money she has left:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's denote the length of Elaina's usual concert as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concert plus a 15-minute encore. The total runtime of the final concert is given as 65 minutes. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the length of Elaina's usual concerts is \(\boxed{25}\) minutes."

1. Start with the initial number of toys Argo has.
2. Subtract the number of toys given to Alyssa.
3. Subtract the number of toys given to Bonnie.
4. Subtract the number of toys given to Nicky.

Let's go through the calculations step by step:

1. Argo starts with 200 toys.
2. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa:
   \[
   200 - 40 = 160
   \]
3. He gives 80 toys to Bonnie:
   \[
   160 - 80 = 80
   \]
4. He gives 30 toys to Nicky:
   \[
   80 - 30 = 50
   \]

So, after giving away all the toys, Argo has \(\boxed{50}\) toys left."
"To determine the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of chimichangas made on each day:
   - On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
   - On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
   - On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

2. Calculate the total number of chimichangas made over the three days:
   \[
   125 \text{ (Tuesdays)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesdays)} + 250 \text{ (Fridays)} = 500
   \]

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means the remaining microphones that can be paired are:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be made from the 40 microphones that can be paired. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He also counts \(\frac{2}{3}\) of that number of birds flying overhead. Since he counted 6 birds nesting, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of 6 is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
   \]
   So, 4 birds are flying overhead.
3. He counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. The total number of birds in these groups is:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry counts:
\[
6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34
\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"Lani started with 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies, so the number of cookies left is:
\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

Next, she placed the remaining 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies are in each jar, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars:
\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, the number of cookies in each jar is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is:
\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is:
\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We do this by subtracting the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:
\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Therefore, the daisies have \(\boxed{15}\) more petals than the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[
\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
\]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Therefore, the number of outdoor plants is:

\[
\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[
\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
\]

To find the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[
\boxed{25\%}
\]"
"To determine the speed at which a whirligig spins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the speed of a thingamabob.
2. Use the speed of a thingamabob to find the speed of a whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11:

\[
\text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

\[
\text{Speed of a whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Thus, the speed at which a whirligig spins is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."
"To determine the cost of one carrot, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the yogurt:**
   The yogurt costs half the price of the salad. Since the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt:**
   The total cost of the salad and yogurt is:
   \[
   6 + 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the total cost of the carrots:**
   Ellen spends a total of $11 on her daily diet. Subtracting the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total cost gives the cost of the carrots:
   \[
   11 - 9 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of one carrot:**
   Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the cost of one carrot is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

Thus, the cost of one carrot every day is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"First, let's determine Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 per hour and received a raise of $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount Mark makes in a week is:

\[
\boxed{480}

"To determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first figure out how much she earned from mowing lawns over the two weeks.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

**First Week:**
- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. Therefore, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so the total payment for the first week is \( 6 \) dollars.

**Second Week:**
- Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. Therefore, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so the total payment for the second week is \( 6 \) dollars.

The total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns over the two weeks is:
\[
6 + 6 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Tasha made a total of $80 last month, which includes her earnings from mowing lawns and lemonade sales. Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:

"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so we calculate Christian's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so we calculate Harry's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Thus, the weight of Harry is \(\boxed{74}\) kg."

   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings from renting the car:**
   \[
   \text{Hourly rate} = \$25
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 30 \times 25 = \$750
   \]

3. **Subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit:**
   \[
   \text{Car payment} = \$500

"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. According to the problem, after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has a total of 7 notebooks. Therefore, the number of notebooks Martha originally had is:
\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, the number of notebooks Joseph had is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph after her purchase. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. The difference is:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Therefore, Martha now has \(\boxed{1}\) more notebook than Joseph."
"First, we need to determine how far Anis rowed. According to the problem, Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Dijana rowed 50 miles, so we calculate the additional distance Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:

\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they both rowed:

\[
50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

Now, we need to divide the remaining 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we perform the division:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get \(\boxed{16}\) cookies."
"To determine how many more pages Denise read compared to Daniel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of pages each person read yesterday.
   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. Calculate the number of pages Denise read today.
   - According to the problem, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday.
   - Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

3. Determine the total number of pages each person read over the two days.
   - Denise's total pages: \(10 \text{ (yesterday)} + 18 \text{ (today)} = 28\) pages.
   - Daniel's total pages: \(13 \text{ (yesterday)} + 0 \text{ (today)} = 13\) pages.

4. Calculate the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel.
   - The difference is \(28 - 13 = 15\) pages.

Thus, Denise read \(\boxed{15}\) more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much soup is available and how it can be distributed among Calvin, his wife, and their two children.

First, let's establish the total amount of soup in terms of adult bowls. The problem states that the pot can fill four adult's bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have one adult's bowl for dinner. Therefore, the total amount of soup used for the adults is:
\[ 1 \text{ (Calvin's bowl)} + 1 \text{ (wife's bowl)} = 2 \text{ adult bowls} \]

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, the remaining amount of soup is:
\[ 4 \text{ adult bowls} - 2 \text{ adult bowls} = 2 \text{ adult bowls} \]

Next, we need to convert the remaining 2 adult bowls into child's bowls. According to the problem, 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 8 child's bowls. Therefore, 1 adult bowl is equivalent to:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ child's bowls}}{4 \text{ adult bowls}} = 2 \text{ child's bowls} \]

So, 2 adult bowls are equivalent to:
\[ 2 \text{ adult bowls} \times 2 \text{ child's bowls per adult bowl} = 4 \text{ child's bowls} \]

Calvin and his wife have already eaten their bowls, so the 2 children will share the remaining 4 child's bowls. Since there are 2 children, each child will get:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ child's bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ child's bowls per child} \]

Thus, each child will be able to have \(\boxed{2}\) bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup."
"To determine how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- William bought 5 notebooks.

\[
\text{Cost of notebooks} = 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.
- William bought 1 ballpen.

\[
\text{Cost of ballpen} = 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
\]

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount William spent is:

\[
\boxed{8.00}
\]"
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we calculate the amount of material needed for 20 small masks. Since 4 small masks require 2 yards of material, we can find out how much material is needed for one small mask by dividing 2 yards by 4:
\[ \text{Material for one small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \]
Now, to find the material needed for 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for one small mask by 20:
\[ \text{Material for 20 small masks} = 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} \times 20 \text{ masks} = 10 \text{ yards} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of material needed for 8 large masks. Since 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material, we can find out how much material is needed for one large mask by dividing 2.25 yards by 3:
\[ \text{Material for one large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \]
Now, to find the material needed for 8 large masks, we multiply the material needed for one large mask by 8:
\[ \text{Material for 8 large masks} = 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} \times 8 \text{ masks} = 6 \text{ yards} \]

Finally, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks to get the total amount of material needed:
\[ \text{Total material} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \]

So, the total amount of material Jo needs is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

   - Average price per ticket = \( \frac{216}{27} \).

4. **Perform the division:**
   - \( \frac{216}{27} = 8 \).

Therefore, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of hours Harold sleeps in a day. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.

Next, we calculate the number of hours Harold works. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so:
\[ 10 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Harold also walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, we need to find out the total number of hours Harold spends on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ hours (sleep)} + 8 \text{ hours (work)} + 1 \text{ hour (dog walk)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has left, we subtract the total hours spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} - 19 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the amount of free time Harold has left in his day is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses and how many are left:

- Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes.
- He uses 3 blue shoe boxes for fishing.
- Therefore, the number of blue shoe boxes left is \(7 - 3 = 4\).

Next, let's determine how many red shoe boxes Tim uses and how many are left:

- Tim starts with 9 red shoe boxes.
- He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes for fishing.
- Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes used is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3\).
- Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is \(9 - 3 = 6\).

So, the number of blue shoe boxes left is 4, and the number of red shoe boxes left is 6.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
4 \text{ blue shoe boxes and } 6 \text{ red shoe boxes}

"First, we determine how many books Joseph originally had. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, and Sarah has 9 books, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Joseph originally had 18 books. Next, we account for the fact that Joseph lost 2 of his books. We subtract 2 from the original number of books Joseph had:

\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of books Joseph currently has is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To solve the problem, we need to determine Adam's current age and then find out how old he will be in 8 years.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age.
- Let \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was \( D - 8 \).
- Adam's age four years ago was \( A - 4 \).
- According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:
  \[
  D - 8 = 2(A - 4)
  \]

Substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[
60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
\]
Simplify the left side:
\[
52 = 2(A - 4)
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
26 = A - 4
\]
Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
\[
A = 30
\]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[
30 + 8 = 38
\]

Therefore, Adam will be \(\boxed{38}\) years old in 8 years."
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

To find twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Next, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of acres for both farms combined. We add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour. Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We do this by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works in a day:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money Colby earns for completing 320 packages. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, we multiply the number of packages by his pay rate:

\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes John to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle. Since a normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, we calculate:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes, given that he drinks a bottle every half hour (30 minutes). We divide the total time by the interval at which he drinks water:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the number of yellow balloons, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let:
- \( r \) be the number of red balloons.
- \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There are 20 red balloons.

First, we can express the total number of bologna pieces thrown in terms of \( r \) and \( y \):
\[
2r + 3y = 58
\]

We also know the number of red balloons:
\[
r = 20
\]

Substitute \( r = 20 \) into the equation:
\[
2(20) + 3y = 58
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
40 + 3y = 58
\]

Subtract 40 from both sides to isolate the term with \( y \):
\[
3y = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( y \):
\[
y = 6
\]

Thus, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first need to calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in a 30-day month. Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, we can find the total miles driven by multiplying the daily miles by the number of days in the month:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tune-ups are required for 3000 miles, given that a tune-up is needed every 1000 miles. We do this by dividing the total miles driven by the interval at which tune-ups are needed:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon needs \(\boxed{3}\) tune-ups in that time."
"First, let's determine how many hours Bruce works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Wednesday is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Thursday is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up the hours worked over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Bruce works in these three days is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then find out how much allowance each of them had initially.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of the balloons: Since 1 dozen balloons is 12 balloons and they are sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the ice cream: They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount of their allowances is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we divide the total allowance by 2:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the total number of pieces of fruit Kira bought:

\[ 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 \]

Next, we account for the fruit that Lola ate. Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, so we subtract this from the total:
\[ 14 - 2 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of fruit left is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of students playing tennis and volleyball. There are 6 students playing tennis. Since the number of students playing volleyball is twice that number, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, there are 12 students playing volleyball. Next, we need to find the total number of students playing tennis and volleyball:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Now, we consider the students playing soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is:

\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \]

Since each student only participates in one group, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to the number of students playing soccer to find the total number of students:

\[ 18 + 38 = 56 \]

Thus, the total number of students is:

\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   - Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - Total lollipops sold = \( 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \).

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.
   - Total revenue = \( 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was bought for $0.5.
   - Total cost = \( 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the profit:**

   \text{Number of cats} = 3
   \]

2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats.
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7
   \]

4. **Fish**: Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits.
   \[
   \text{Number of fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

5. **Gerbils**: Larry has a collection of gerbils that is \(\frac{1}{3}\) the number of fish.
   \[
   \text{Number of gerbils} = \frac{21}{3} = 7

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The pool has 10,000 gallons of water, and they fill the tank with half of that amount:

\[
\text{Amount of water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day:

\[
\text{Total water used in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water:

\[
\text{Remaining water in the tank} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons}

"To determine the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
3. Determine the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Determine the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins.
5. Sum the total calories from both types of pastries.

First, we calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll. Since a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, and a normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories:
\[
\text{Calories in one mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories}
\]

Next, we calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin. Since a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories:
\[
\text{Calories in one mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories}
\]

Now, we determine the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls:
\[
\text{Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls} = 200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories}
\]

Next, we determine the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins. Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins:
\[
\text{Total calories from mini blueberry muffins} = 300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories}
\]

Finally, we sum the total calories from both types of pastries:
\[
\text{Total calories} = 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \text{ calories}
\]

Thus, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Calculate the number of Junebugs removed each day:**
   - **Monday:** 39 Junebugs
   - **Tuesday:** Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
   - **Wednesday:** Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
   - **Thursday:** 48 Junebugs
   - **Friday:** 57 Junebugs

2. **Sum the total number of Junebugs removed:**
   \[
   39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
   \]

3. **Perform the addition step-by-step:**
   \[
   39 + 78 = 117
   \]
   \[
   117 + 78 = 195
   \]
   \[
   195 + 48 = 243
   \]
   \[
   243 + 57 = 300
   \]

4. **Calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day:**
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of Junebugs}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{300}{5}
   \]

5. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{300}{5} = 60
   \]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. The distance traveled by the bus is given by:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the distance traveled by the car. The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. The distance traveled by the car is given by:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, find the difference in the distances traveled by the bus and the car:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we need to first calculate the total number of toys Sophie already had before adding the bouncy balls. We know the quantities of the building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:

- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

First, we add these quantities together:

\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

This sum, 48, represents the total number of toys Sophie had before adding the bouncy balls. We know that after adding the bouncy balls, the total number of toys is 62. Let \( x \) represent the number of bouncy balls. We can set up the following equation to find \( x \):

\[ 48 + x = 62 \]

To solve for \( x \), we subtract 48 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 62 - 48 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as follows:
- Let \( P \) be the age of Peter.
- Let \( p \) be the age of Paul.
- Let \( j \) be the age of Jean.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( P + p + j = 100 \)
2. \( p = j + 10 \)
3. \( P = p + j \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( p \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (j + 10) + j = 2j + 10 \]

Now we have \( P \) in terms of \( j \). Next, we substitute \( p = j + 10 \) and \( P = 2j + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[ (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100 \]
\[ 2j + 10 + j + 10 + j = 100 \]
\[ 4j + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4j = 80 \]
\[ j = 20 \]

Now that we have \( j = 20 \), we can find \( p \) and \( P \):
\[ p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2j + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, the age of Peter is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of water balloons each friend received initially. Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. Therefore, the total number of water balloons given to her friends initially is:
\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, we need to account for the water balloons Maria had for herself. She had 1 water balloon:
\[ 1 \text{ balloon} \]

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons given is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Now, we can find the total number of water balloons by adding the initial balloons, the balloons Maria had, and the additional balloons given by her mom:
\[ 8 \text{ initial balloons} + 1 \text{ balloon Maria had} + 15 \text{ additional balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

Thus, the total number of water balloons the girls had is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and the boxes already owned by the charity group.

- Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes, so the total number of donated boxes is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes.
- They already have 10 boxes.

Adding these together, the total number of boxes is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes.

The number of tables required is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already owns 15 tables. Therefore, the number of new tables needed is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Thus, the number of new tables they need is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds: 40
- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey = \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Next, we find the combined total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney:
- Combined total distance = \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the combined total distance by the number of participants (which is 2):
- Average total distance = \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

Therefore, the average total distance spat is:
410 feet"
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:**
   - **Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Widgets per hour: 60
     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days per month: 30
     \[
     \text{Total widgets} = 60 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 43200 \, \text{widgets}
     \]

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Widgets per hour: 45
     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days per month: 30
     \[
     \text{Total widgets} = 45 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 32400 \, \text{widgets}

2. **Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets:**
   - **Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     \[
     \text{Revenue} = 43200 \, \text{widgets} \times 6 \, \text{\$/widget} = 259200 \, \text{\$}
     \]

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     \[
     \text{Revenue} = 32400 \, \text{widgets} \times 6 \, \text{\$/widget} = 194400 \, \text{\$}
     \]

3. **Calculate the difference in revenue:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 259200 \, \text{\$} - 194400 \, \text{\$} = 64800 \, \text{\$}

Thus, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's determine the total duration of Cameron's stay. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This means he stays from 5 pm to 10 am, which is 17 hours.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under the two different options:

1. **24-hour stay option:**
   - The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

2. **12-hour stay plus additional hours option:**
   - The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
   - Cameron stays for an additional 5 hours (17 hours total - 12 hours).
   - The cost for each additional hour is 70 pesos.
   - Therefore, the cost for the additional 5 hours is \(5 \times 70 = 350\) pesos.
   - The total cost for this option is \(1000 + 350 = 1350\) pesos.

Now, we compare the two options to find out how much Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- The cost for the 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.
- The cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours stay is 1350 pesos.
- The savings would be \(1600 - 1350 = 250\) pesos.

Thus, Cameron would save \(\boxed{250}\) pesos."
"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the hay requirement for each sheep:**
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds.
   - Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds.

2. **Calculate the total hay needed for the goats:**
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds.
   - Total hay for goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

3. **Calculate the total hay needed for the sheep:**
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Each sheep needs 7 pounds.
   - Total hay for sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

4. **Calculate the total hay needed for all the livestock:**
   - Total hay for goats is 75 pounds.
   - Total hay for sheep is 84 pounds.
   - Total hay needed is \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of hay Nate needs is \(\boxed{159}\) pounds."
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so after the deposit, he has:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the pencils, the remaining money is:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \]

So, the number of 25 dollar pens John can buy is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, we add the total number of letters spelled by Craig and his brother to find the overall total:
\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"To determine the total number of children participating in the mass drill, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of children in one row.
2. Calculate the number of children in one school.
3. Calculate the total number of children from all five schools.

First, we know that each row has 8 children. Since there are 7 rows for each school, the number of children in one school is:
\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ children/school} \]

Next, since there are 5 different schools, the total number of children from all five schools is:
\[ 56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

Thus, the total number of children in the drill is:
\[
\boxed{280}

"First, let's determine the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming her coupons. Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, and the teacher has 9 coupons. Therefore, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice required for the 29 students. Each student gets 2 bottles, so the total number of bottles needed for the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[
\boxed{842}

"To determine the total charge for the job, we need to consider the fixed visit charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Fixed Visit Charge**: Patty's Plumbing charges a fixed amount of $40 to visit the house.
2. **Labor Charge**: The labor charge is $35 per hour, or part thereof. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we need to calculate the labor charge for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as a full hour). Therefore, the labor charge is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105
   \]
3. **Parts Cost**: The cost of parts used was $60.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total charge:
\[
\$40 \text{ (visit charge)} + \$105 \text{ (labor charge)} + \$60 \text{ (parts cost)} = \$205
\]

Thus, the total charge for the job is:
\[
\boxed{205}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount. Each CD costs $15, so the total cost is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount. A 40% discount means James pays 60% of the original price. So, the cost after the discount is:
\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James is out after selling the 5 CDs. The amount he is out is the discounted total cost minus the money he got from selling the 5 CDs:
\[ 90 - 200 = -110 \]

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $110. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which in this context means the absolute value of the loss, which is $0 since he gained money. But if we interpret the question strictly as how much he spent initially minus what he got from selling, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To determine how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the earnings from yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam is sold for $1.5.
   - Total earnings from yams = \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the earnings from sweet potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato is sold for $2.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the earnings from carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots = \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \) dollars.

4. **Sum up the total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots
   - Total earnings = \( 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \) dollars.

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn \(\boxed{34}\) dollars."
"To determine the total time James took to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum initially} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   James swims at half the initial speed for the remaining distance.
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   Add the time taken to swim the initial distance, the rest time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time James took to get across the lake is \(\boxed{17}\) hours."
"To determine how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we start by identifying the number of loaves Sam had last Friday, which is given as 70 loaves.

The problem states that the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. We can express this relationship mathematically as follows:

1. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had:
   \[
   7 \times 70 = 490
   \]

2. Subtract 40 from this product to find the number of loaves the bakery has:
   \[
   490 - 40 = 450
   \]

Therefore, the bakery has \(\boxed{450}\) loaves of bread."

"To determine Cayley's total commission, we need to calculate the commission from each type of newspaper separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- He sells 6 copies of the New York Times.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- He sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo’s age. Let's denote Leo’s age by \( L \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{L}{2} \]

Since Marcus is 21 years old, we substitute 21 for Marcus's age in the equation:

\[ 21 = \frac{L}{2} \]

To find \( L \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ L = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

So, Leo is \(\boxed{42}\) years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the three individuals is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us the following equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions for \( A \) and \( D \) into the first equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we know \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

To verify, we check the total points:

\[ B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of points Azibo scored is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The paper is stacked such that 100 pages occupy 1 inch.
   - The book is 1.5 inches thick.
   - Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page per side.

2. **Calculate the number of pages per inch:**
   - Given that 100 pages occupy 1 inch, the number of pages per inch is 100.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:**
   - Since 1 inch contains 100 pages, 1.5 inches will contain:
     \[
     1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages/inch} = 150 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Account for both sides of the paper:**
   - Each paper is printed on both sides, meaning each sheet of paper contributes 2 pages to the book.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
     \[
     \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages per sheet}} = 75 \text{ sheets}
     \]
   - Since each sheet has 2 pages, the total number of pages is:
     \[
     75 \text{ sheets} \times 2 \text{ pages per sheet} = 150 \text{ pages}
     \]

Thus, the total number of pages in the book is \(\boxed{150}\)."

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Kim's usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Determine the time Kim was awake during her sleepwalking episode:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of her sleepwalking episode is \( 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 \) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before her usual wake-up time:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her wake-up time was 5 minutes before 6 a.m., which is 5:55 a.m.
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes.
   - Convert 3 hours and 40 minutes to minutes: \( 3 \times 60 + 40 = 220 \) minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake that day:**
   - Total awake time = Time before usual wake-up + Sleepwalking time
   - Total awake time = 220 minutes + 23 minutes = 243 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time from when Kim went to sleep until she woke up:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes.
   - Convert 7 hours and 55 minutes to minutes: \( 7 \times 60 + 55 = 475 \) minutes.

6. **Calculate the time Kim slept on her bed:**
   - Total sleep time = Total time from sleep to wake up - Total awake time
   - Total sleep time = 475 minutes - 243 minutes = 232 minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{232}\) minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. According to the problem, he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of the beds are occupied, we calculate:

\[
\text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
\]

Next, we need to find the number of unoccupied beds initially:

\[
\text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

The hospital admits 50 patients each day. Over the course of 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions is:

\[
\text{Total new admissions} = 50 \times 14 = 700
\]

These new admissions will occupy 700 of the unoccupied beds. Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 800 - 700 = 100
\]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails, which are not to family, are to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are sent to her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Now, we need to determine how many of these 3 remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. The problem states that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"First, we determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we find the age of Shawna's father, who is five times as old as Shawna:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Thus, the age of Shawna's father is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"If Courtney reported 48 people and Kelly says that number is 20% more than the actual number, we need to find the original number of people before the 20% increase.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to the problem, Courtney's number (48) is 20% more than the actual number \( x \). This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"To determine the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice, we need to establish the number of balls each boy carried based on the given relationships and the specific number of balls Jason carried.

1. Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
2. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. Therefore, Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason. Therefore, Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

Given that Jason carried 2 balls, we can substitute \( J \) with 2:
\[ J = 2 \]

Now, we can find the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 2 \) balls.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \times 2 = 4 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 2 = 8 \) balls.

To find the total number of balls, we sum the balls carried by all three boys:
\[ \text{Total number of balls} = J + 2J + 4J = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14 \]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

Next, we need to find out how many holes were left after filling in 2 holes:
\[ 29 - 2 = 27 \]

According to the problem, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day is 10. Therefore, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[ 40 - 27 = 13 \]

Thus, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \). According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey. Therefore, we can express the number of corn chips Collins received as:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of corn chips. This is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Now, let's perform the addition:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total cost of the tickets for travel. The problem states that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \). According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \( 4A - 13 \). Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[ 9A = 339 + 21 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = \frac{360}{9} \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon, we can find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, the number of Pokemon that Stan has caught is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. According to the problem, each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend watching all the episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

\[
\boxed{200}

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southward direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northward direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we calculate the net southward distance by adding the distances traveled in the southward directions and subtracting the distance traveled in the northward direction:

\[
\text{Net Southward Distance} = 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

\[
\boxed{374}

"To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial Batch of Brownies:**
   Greta made one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. **Brownies Sent from Office:**
   At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. **Total Brownies Before the Surprise Party:**
   Adding the brownies from the initial batch and those from the office:
   \[
   12 \text{ brownies} + 6 \text{ brownies} = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

4. **Brownies Received for the Surprise Party:**
   Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for the surprise party.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

5. **Total Brownies Before the Party:**
   Adding the brownies from the surprise party:
   \[
   18 \text{ brownies} + 48 \text{ brownies} = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

6. **Brownies Eaten During the Party:**
   During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   \[
   1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

7. **Brownies Left Over:**
   Subtracting the brownies eaten from the total brownies:
   \[
   66 \text{ brownies} - 18 \text{ brownies} = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Thus, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"First, let's determine the age of Nani's brother. Since Nani is 8 years old and his brother is twice his age, we calculate:

\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Next, we need to find the age of Nani's sister. She is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \text{ years} \]

Since she is 25% younger, we subtract this from Nani's age:

\[ \text{Sister's age} = 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age of all three family members:

\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

Thus, the total age of all three family members is:

"To determine how much John paid for the phones, we need to break down the cost based on the given conditions. John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones. The first 2 phones are at full price, and each phone after the first 2 is at half price.

1. The price of each phone is $600.
2. The cost for the first 2 phones is:
   \[
   2 \times 600 = 1200
   \]
3. The cost for the remaining 2 phones (which are at half price) is:
   \[
   2 \times \left(\frac{600}{2}\right) = 2 \times 300 = 600
   \]
4. Adding the costs together, the total amount John paid is:

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wood slats required is:

\[ \text{Total number of slats} = 2 \times \text{perimeter} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{100}

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister. Since she gave 2 boxes to each:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes (to mom)} + 2 \text{ boxes (to sister)} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining boxes. Calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the 8 boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes she kept from the remaining boxes to find out how many boxes she sold:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 2 \text{ boxes} = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box contains 20 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 6 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Thus, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:

"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{x}{2} + 4
\]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[
x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right)
\]

To simplify this expression, we combine like terms:
\[
x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4
\]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the expression, we get:
\[
\frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79
\]

Thus, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[
\boxed{79}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost of the books:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs $25 more to afford the books. Since he earns $5 per hour, we need to determine how many hours he must work to earn $25. We do this by dividing the amount of money he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work \(\boxed{5}\) hours to afford the books."

   - Apple pie: \(10 - 4 = 6\) boxes

2. **Sunday:**
   - Gingerbread: \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes
   - Apple pie: \(15\) boxes

Next, we calculate the earnings for each day:

1. **Saturday:**
   - Earnings from gingerbread: \(10 \text{ boxes} \times \$6/\text{box} = \$60\)
   - Earnings from apple pie: \(6 \text{ boxes} \times \$15/\text{box} = \$90\)
   - Total earnings for Saturday: \(\$60 + \$90 = \$150\)

2. **Sunday:**
   - Earnings from gingerbread: \(15 \text{ boxes} \times \$6/\text{box} = \$90\)
   - Earnings from apple pie: \(15 \text{ boxes} \times \$15/\text{box} = \$225\)
   - Total earnings for Sunday: \(\$90 + \$225 = \$315\)

Finally, we sum the earnings from both days to find the total earnings:

\[
\$150 + \$315 = \$465

     \]

Thus, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"First, let's determine the price of the red car. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we need to calculate 40% of the blue car's price and subtract that from the blue car's price.

The price of the blue car is $100. 

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - He will turn 24 in \(24 - 19 = 5\) years.

2. **Determine the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Let \(D\) be the current age of Emil's dad.
   - In 5 years, Emil's dad will be \(D + 5\) years old.
   - According to the problem, \(24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)\).

3. **Solve for \(D\):**
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   48 = D + 5
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   D = 43
   \]
   So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

4. **Determine the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Let \(B\) be the current age of Emil's brother.
   - In 5 years, Emil's brother will be \(B + 5\) years old.
   - According to the problem, \(24 = 2(B + 5)\).

5. **Solve for \(B\):**
   \[
   24 = 2(B + 5)
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   12 = B + 5
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   B = 7
   \]
   So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

6. **Find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:**
   \[
   43 + 7 = 50
   \]

Thus, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate 25% of 24:

\[ 25\% \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are cheerleaders or part of the band.

Adding the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members gives us the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, we determine the size of the boots Charlie wears. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the two sizes together and then dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Thus, the average size of the shoe worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how much money Pat will spend to fill her flower bed with plants, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the plants and the spacing to the same unit:**
   - Each plant grows 12 inches wide. Convert this to feet: 
     \[
     12 \text{ inches} = \frac{12}{12} \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot}
     \]
   - The spacing between each plant is 1.5 feet.

2. **Calculate the total space required for one plant and the space between it and the next plant:**
   - Space for one plant and the space between it and the next plant:
     \[
     1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long. Divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for one plant and the space between it and the next plant:
     \[
     \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants}
     \]
   - Since Pat can only have whole plants, we take the integer part:
     \[
     44 \text{ plants}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants needed:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants. Subtract the number of plants she already has from the total number of plants needed:
     \[
     44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6. Multiply the number of additional plants by the cost per plant:
     \[
     27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day. Since Edgar's brother eats \(\frac{1}{2}\) as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of pretzels he eats per day by 7:

\[
\text{Number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63
\]

Thus, Edgar's brother eats \(\boxed{63}\) pretzels in a week."
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost of the petunias for one basket:
- Each basket contains 3 petunias.
- Each petunia costs $3.00.

\[
\text{Cost of petunias per basket} = 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines for one basket:
- Each basket contains 2 sweet potato vines.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

\[
\text{Cost of sweet potato vines per basket} = 2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per vine} = \$5.00
\]

Now, let's find the total cost for one basket by adding the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines:

\[
\text{Total cost per basket} = \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00
\]

Finally, we need to find the total cost for all 5 baskets:

\[
\text{Total cost for 5 baskets} = 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00
\]

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:

\[
\boxed{70}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With the remaining 3 pounds of soil, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for the shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck. We calculate this as follows:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes. Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12:

\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Now, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00, given that each pair costs $1,000.00. We divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[ 6000 \div 1000 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy \(\boxed{6}\) pairs of shoes in a year."
"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both the peeling and sauteing processes.

First, let's calculate the time required to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To find out how many minutes it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6:
  \[
  \frac{90}{6} = 15 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the time required to saute 90 shrimp:
- Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To find out how many minutes it takes to saute 90 shrimp, we first determine how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
  \[
  \frac{90}{30} = 3
  \]
- Since each set of 30 shrimp takes 10 minutes, 3 sets will take:
  \[
  3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Now, we add the time required for peeling and sauteing:
- Time to peel 90 shrimp: 15 minutes
- Time to saute 90 shrimp: 30 minutes
- Total time: 
  \[
  15 + 30 = 45 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Thus, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is \(\boxed{45}\) minutes."
"To determine the final temperature of the room, we need to calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours.
   - Cooling rate on low: 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Subsequent Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner is then turned up to high for 4 hours.
   - Cooling rate on high: 3 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ degrees/hour} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **Warming Up:**
   - The air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours.
   - Warming rate: 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming during this period: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

4. **Net Temperature Change:**
   - Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Net temperature change: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\).

Thus, the final temperature of the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final Answer:**

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \( D \).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - According to the problem, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3D \).

3. **Calculate the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Set up the equation for Bill's age at the second sighting:**
   - Let \( B \) be Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Therefore, the age difference between the first and second sighting is \( 3D - B = 75 \).

5. **Express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):**
   - We need to find \( B \). To do this, we need to express \( D \) in terms of \( B \). Since Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was \( 3D \) and the first time when he was \( B \), the difference in their ages when they saw the comet is the same as the time interval between the sightings. So, \( 3D - B = 75 \).

6. **Solve for \( B \):**
   - We need to find \( B \). Since we don't have the exact value of \( D \), we can use the relationship directly. If Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was \( 3D \) and the first time when he was \( B \), and the time interval is 75 years, then:
     \[
     3D - B = 75
     \]
   - We need to find \( B \). Since \( D \) is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet, and Bill saw it for the second time when he was \( 3D \), we can use the fact that the time interval is 75 years. If we assume \( D \) is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet, then:
     \[
     B + 75 = 3D
     \]
   - Since \( D \) is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet, and Bill saw it for the second time when he was \( 3D \), we can solve for \( B \):
     \[
     B = 3D - 75
     \]
   - We need to find \( D \). Since the time interval is 75 years, and Bill saw it for the second time when he was \( 3D \), we can use the fact that the time interval is 75 years. If we assume \( D \) is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet, then:
     \[
     B = 3D - 75
     \]
   - Since the time interval is 75 years, and Bill saw it for the second time when he was \( 3D \), we can solve for \( B \):
     \[
     B = 3D - 75
     \]
   - If we assume \( D = 30 \) (since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30), then:
     \[
     B = 3 \times 30 - 75 = 90 - 75 = 15
     \]

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of electric bill checks per year is:
     \[
     1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

2. **Gas bill checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of gas bill checks per year is:
     \[
     1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

3. **Church checks:**
   - Buford writes two checks per month to the church.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of church checks per year is:
     \[
     2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

4. **Pest and lawn service checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per quarter to the pest and lawn service.
   - There are 4 quarters in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of pest and lawn service checks per year is:
     \[
     1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52 \text{ checks/year}
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
\boxed{52}
\]"
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[
\frac{3}{4}F
\]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are:
\[
F - \frac{3}{4}F = \frac{1}{4}F
\]

Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{8}F
\]

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips. According to the problem, these 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[
44 = \frac{1}{2}F
\]

Solving for \( F \):
\[
F = 44 \times 2 = 88
\]

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \):
\[
\frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11
\]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl:**
   - Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.

3. **Igneous's howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls.
   - The combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

Next, we calculate the total duration of all three wolves' howls:
\[
20 \text{ seconds (Tobias)} + 40 \text{ seconds (Chikote)} + 60 \text{ seconds (Igneous)} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[
\frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much money Adam received from his father. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Adam received $12 from his father. Now, we add the money given by his mother and his father to find the total amount of money Adam received:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam's new trousers cost $30. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount of money he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. Akbar's age \( A = 3 \) years.
2. Alessandro's age \( B = 4 \) years.
3. The total age of the children is 20 years.
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age of the children as:
\[
A + B + H + W = 20
\]
Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( B \):
\[
3 + 4 + H + W = 20
\]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[
7 + H + W = 20
\]
Subtracting 7 from both sides, we find:
\[
H + W = 13
\]

Next, we use the information that Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}
\]
Substituting the known values and the expression for the total age:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]
Since Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[
H = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[
10 + W = 13
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides, we find:
\[
W = 3
\]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. The amount collected from his neighbors is $500, and the amount collected from the online fund is $1500. Adding these together gives:

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. According to the problem, the lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6000} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of cookies brought to the reception. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ratio of the slices each adult and each kid gets and then convert that into a percentage of the whole watermelon.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 2 \text{ (adults)} \times 2x \text{ (each adult's slice)} + 4 \text{ (kids)} \times x \text{ (each kid's slice)} = 4x + 4x = 8x. \]

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \( 8x \). Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100. \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\%. \]

Therefore, each adult gets \(\boxed{25\%}\) of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for rounds is:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the 10 appointments. Each appointment takes 30 minutes, so:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and the time for the appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic. Therefore, the time left for updating his records is:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"

   - Desired completion time: 5:00 pm
   - Total time required: 3 hours
   - Start time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is **2:00 pm**."
"To determine how many chocolate bars are in a box, we start by defining the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars. Peter sold 4.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Thus, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to break down the costs and earnings step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost per session:**

"To determine how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:**
   - Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars.
   - Let \( p \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes.
   - We can set up the equation: \( 4p = 64 \).
   - Solving for \( p \):
     \[
     p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
     \]
   - So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

2. **Determine the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha:**
   - Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars.
   - Let \( m \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes.
   - We can set up the equation: \( 7m = 56 \).
   - Solving for \( m \):
     \[
     m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
     \]
   - So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha:**
   - The difference is given by \( p - m \):
     \[
     p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
     \]

Therefore, Peter has \(\boxed{8}\) more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find out how many porcupine babies are born each month. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. Adding the number of babies born in a year to the initial population gives us the total population of porcupines after a year:

\[
\text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The conversion factor is that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
\[ G = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 7.48 \, \text{gallons per cubic foot} \]
\[ G = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per gallon} \]
\[ C = 1047.20 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each type of stick and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks:**
   - There are 9 red sticks.

2. **Blue Sticks:**
   - The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of blue sticks is:
     \[
     9 + 5 = 14
     \]

3. **Yellow Sticks:**
   - The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is:
     \[
     14 - 3 = 11
     \]

4. **Total Number of Sticks:**
   - Sum the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:
     \[
     9 + 14 + 11 = 34
     \]

Thus, the total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled by Matteo.**
- Speed of Matteo: 55 miles per hour
- Time traveled by Matteo: 4 hours

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by Shandy.**
- Speed of Shandy: 45 miles per hour
- Time traveled by Shandy: 10 hours

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.**
\[ \text{Difference in distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} \]
\[ \text{Difference in distance} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, Shandy drove \(\boxed{230}\) miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's determine the number of students over 16 years old and the number of students under 16 years old.

The total number of students is 3000. Half of these students are over 16 years old:
\[
\text{Number of students over 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
\]
The remaining half are under 16 years old:
\[
\text{Number of students under 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
\]

Next, we calculate the number of male students over 16 years old. One-fourth of the students over 16 are male:
\[
\text{Number of male students over 16} = \frac{1500}{4} = 375
\]
Therefore, the number of female students over 16 years old is:
\[
\text{Number of female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
\]

Now, we calculate the number of male students under 16 years old. One-half of the students under 16 are male:
\[
\text{Number of male students under 16} = \frac{1500}{2} = 750
\]
Therefore, the number of female students under 16 years old is:
\[
\text{Number of female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750
\]

Finally, we find the total number of female students by adding the number of female students over 16 and the number of female students under 16:
\[
\text{Total number of female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875
\]

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at the school is:
\[
\boxed{1875}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run in one hour based on the information given.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so:
   \[
   \text{Trey's laps} = 10 + 4 = 14
   \]
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so:
   \[
   \text{Shaelyn's laps} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so:
   \[
   \text{Quinn's laps} = 7 - 2 = 5
   \]

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Bethany's laps} - \text{Quinn's laps} = 10 - 5 = 5
\]

Thus, Bethany can run \(\boxed{5}\) more laps compared to Quinn."
"To determine how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons.
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the amount Wanda pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on the first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on the second day} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped over two days} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining capacity of the tank:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining capacity} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge, accounting for the different rates of charge loss.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank's charge is 28%.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).

   \[
   x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
   \]

   Calculate \( (0.93)^3 \):

   \[
   (0.93)^3 = 0.804357
   \]

   So,

   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]

   Solving for \( x \):

   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]

   Therefore, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours is approximately 34.8%.

3. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).

   \[
   y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348
   \]

   Calculate \( (0.91)^5 \):

   \[
   (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032
   \]

   So,

   \[
   y \times 0.624032 = 0.348
   \]

   Solving for \( y \):

   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.557
   \]

   Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park is approximately 55.7%.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, making a total of $25 per hour. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 1000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Janet wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. So, the amount she needs to save is:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000. Since she earns $1000 per week, the number of weeks required is:

\[ \frac{2000 \text{ dollars}}{1000 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased.

- The cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- The cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- The cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- The cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, we add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide $0.75 by $0.25:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, we need to determine the total number of sweets in the box. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is calculated as follows:
\[
15 \times 60 = 900
\]
Next, Anne kept 2 packs for herself. Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of sweets she kept is:
\[
2 \times 60 = 120
\]
To find out how many sweets were given to her friends, we subtract the number of sweets Anne kept from the total number of sweets:
\[
900 - 120 = 780
\]
Anne gave these 780 sweets equally to her 10 friends. Therefore, the number of sweets each friend received is:
\[
780 \div 10 = 78
\]
So, each of her friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price after \( n \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply this result by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"

\]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes James to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[
\text{Time for 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of guests:**
   The hotel starts with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkouts:**
   24 guests elected to check out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

3. **Late checkouts:**
   15 guests elected to check out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

4. **Afternoon check-ins:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests checked in}
   \]
   Adding these to the remaining guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91 \text{ guests}
   \]

5. **Additional check-ins after dinner:**
   7 more people checked in after dinner.
   \[

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so we have:
\[ L = 3S \]
We are also given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so:
\[ S = 4 \]
Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ L = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is:
\[ x \times L = x \times 12 \]
The total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is:
\[ 2x \times S = 2x \times 4 = 8x \]
The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is given as $120, so we can write the equation:
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 20x = 120 \]
Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]
So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6, and the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

   - Number of yellow balloons released: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \)
   - Remaining yellow balloons: \( 12 - 6 = 6 \)

4. **Finding and Adding Blue Balloons:**
   - Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree.
   - She added 75% of these blue balloons to her remaining clutch.
   - Number of blue balloons added: \( 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \)

5. **Total Number of Balloons Carried into the School:**
   - Red balloons: 15
   - Green balloons: 7
   - Yellow balloons: 6
   - Blue balloons: 6

   Summing these up:
   \[
   15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

Thus, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% = 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% = 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (since 100% - 40% = 60%) = 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% = 0.20
   - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum these probabilities to find the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

\[
0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.102
\]

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we subtract this total from 1 (or 100%):

\[
1 - 0.102 = 0.898
\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[
0.898 \times 100 = 89.8\%
\]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[
\boxed{89.8\%}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} + 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 1250 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

**Final Answer:**
Each graduate would receive 5 tickets."
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans and then use these relationships to find the number of small jelly beans he can consume.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium jelly beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - To find out how many small jelly beans correspond to 150 medium jelly beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium jelly beans} \times 3 \text{ small jelly beans per medium jelly bean} = 450 \text{ small jelly beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is:
\[
\boxed{450}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so the total hours are:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day, and she works for 3 days, so her total earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate her total parking expenses. She has to pay $3 for parking each day, and she works for 3 days, so her total parking expenses are:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find her net earnings after parking expenses, we subtract the total parking expenses from her total earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, the amount of jury pay Melissa makes per hour after expenses is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, we calculate the total cost of the books. Ted buys 3 books at $16 each:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the pencils. Ted buys 3 pencils at $6 each:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils to find the total amount spent:
\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Ted spent is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"To determine how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - The number of intervals between bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \) intervals.
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Determine the total time to drop the candy in each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.
   - To drop the candy in all 9 bottles, he needs to make 8 transitions (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the eighth to the ninth).
   - The total time is \( 8 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \).

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \(\boxed{40}\) seconds."
"First, we need to determine the total number of apples Uncle Franky has. Since there are forty apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, we calculate the total number of apples as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of apples he can make if each pack contains eight apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, the number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"First, we calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese that Amor buys. The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she buys 2 pounds:

\[ 11 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 2 \, \text{pounds} = 22 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the mozzarella cheese that Amor buys. The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she buys 3 pounds:

\[ 6 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 3 \, \text{pounds} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total amount spent:

\[ 22 \, \text{dollars} + 18 \, \text{dollars} = 40 \, \text{dollars} \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after her purchases, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money she had:

\[ 50 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of loans:**
   Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   \[
   \text{Total loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working:**
   Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year. Without the job, he lost this income for 4 years.
   \[
   \text{Total income lost} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn:**
   This is the sum of the total loans and the total income lost.
   \[
   \text{Total money needed} = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000
   \]

4. **Determine Jim's new income after earning a college degree:**
   His income tripled after earning the degree. His original income was $25,000 per year.
   \[
   \text{New income} = 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000
   \]

5. **Calculate the time required to earn the total money needed:**
   We need to find out how many years it will take to earn $300,000 at a new income of $75,000 per year.
   \[
   \text{Time required} = \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, it will take Jim \(\boxed{4}\) years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece. The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For one fabric piece:
\[ A = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday's Deliveries:**
   The post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Deliveries:**
   On Tuesday, the post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many letters as on Monday. First, we calculate one-fifth of Monday's deliveries:
   \[
   \frac{425}{5} = 85
   \]
   Then, we add 17 to this amount:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday's Deliveries:**
   On Wednesday, the post office delivered 5 more than twice as many letters as on Tuesday. First, we calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this amount:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

4. **Total Deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:**
   Now, we sum the deliveries from all three days:
   \[
   425 + 102 + 209 = 736
   \]

Thus, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is \(\boxed{736}\)."
"To determine the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad and then sum these costs.

- Number of people wanting chicken salad: 10
- Cost per person for chicken salad: $6.50
\[
\text{Total cost for chicken salad} = 10 \times 6.50 = 65
\]

Next, we calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
- Number of people wanting pasta salad: 6
- Cost per person for pasta salad: $6
\[
\text{Total cost for pasta salad} = 6 \times 6 = 36
\]

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 65 + 36 = 101
\]

Thus, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is:
\[
\boxed{101}

"To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average, we need to calculate the net amount he won or lost in each race and then find the average.

1. **First Race:**
   - Lost $5.
   - Net loss: \(-5\).

2. **Second Race:**
   - Won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Won: \(10 + 1 = 11\).
   - Net gain: \(11\).

3. **Third Race:**
   - Lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race: \(11\).
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).
   - Net loss: \(-16.5\).

Now, we sum up the net amounts from each race:
\[
-5 + 11 - 16.5 = -10.5
\]

Next, we calculate the average loss by dividing the total net loss by the number of races (3):
\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{-10.5}{3} = -3.5
\]

Thus, the average amount lost per race is:
\[
\boxed{-3.5}

"To determine the total population of South America based on the given information, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Number of countries in South America**: 26
2. **Number of cities in each country**: 5
3. **Population of each city**: 1000 people

First, calculate the total number of cities in South America:
\[
\text{Total number of cities} = \text{Number of countries} \times \text{Number of cities per country}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of cities} = 26 \times 5 = 130
\]

Next, calculate the total population of all the cities combined:
\[
\text{Total population} = \text{Total number of cities} \times \text{Population per city}
\]
\[
\text{Total population} = 130 \times 1000 = 130,000
\]

Thus, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is:
\[
\boxed{130000}

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches since the growth is given in inches.

Xavier's original height is 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert Xavier's height as follows:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's original height is already given in inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} \]

Cole grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

Therefore, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

First, simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Then, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the time worked per day into hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the hours worked per day by the team is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is:
     \[
     3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - The team worked 9 hours each day for 21 days.
   - Therefore, the total hours worked by the team is:
     \[
     9 \times 21 = 189 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Therefore, the hours worked by each painter is:
     \[
     \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
     \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{47.25}

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

First, combine the terms involving \( x \):
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot (2x) + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved \( x = 6 \) balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, meaning it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula for the value of the car after \( t \) years is given by:
\[ \text{Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^t \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and \( t = 3 \) years. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ \text{Value} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this result by the initial value of the car:
\[ \text{Value} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"
"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we can follow these steps:

   - There are 50 books in total.
   - Half of them are written in English.
   \[
   \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of German books:**
   - 10% of the books are written in German.
   \[
   \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of Spanish books:**
   - The rest of the books are written in Spanish.
   - Subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books.
   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of Spanish books is \(\boxed{20}\)."

"To determine how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days.
2. Convert the total number of cups into gallons.

First, we know that Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, the total number of cups she drinks is:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cups into gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16:
\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of people on the train at the final stop.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   \[
   120 \text{ people}
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   - 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   - 50 people descend from the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 = 90 \text{ people}
   \]
   - Twice the number of people who descended (which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)) board the train.
   \[
   90 + 100 = 190 \text{ people}
   \]

4. **Third stop:**
   - 80 more people descend from the train.

1. **Tank top cost**: $10
2. **Running shorts cost**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis shoes cost**: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic socks cost**: Package originally $8, with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55 \]

So, Alison spent \(\boxed{55}\) dollars on athletic gear."
"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles required is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}\).

Thus, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \(\boxed{2400}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the increased cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost of the insurance is $120 per month. Since the cost is 60% more than normal, we calculate 60% of $120:

\[ 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the increased cost per month is $72. Adding this to the normal cost gives:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

This means the new monthly cost of the insurance is $192. To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:

\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used per week:**
   - Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week.
   - Greg uses 1 king sheet per week.
   - Total sheets per week = 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sheets.

2. **Determine the number of loads needed per week:**
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time.
   - Since 4 twin sheets are used per week, it will take 2 loads to wash all the twin sheets (2 sets per load).
   - 1 king sheet is used per week, which will take 1 load.
   - Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads.

3. **Calculate the number of weeks in a year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.

4. **Calculate the total number of loads per year:**
   - Total loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads.

Thus, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday:**
   They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Calculate the number of movies watched on Sunday:**
   They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of movies watched in one weekend:**
   The total number of movies watched in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday) is:
   \[
   4 + 2 = 6
   \]

"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of stickers Leo had two years ago:**
   \[
   \text{Stickers two years ago} = 100
   \]

2. **Determine the number of stickers Leo collected last year:**
   \[
   \text{Stickers last year} = 50
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of stickers Leo collected this year:**
   \[
   \text{Stickers this year} = 2 \times \text{Stickers last year} = 2 \times 50 = 100
   \]

4. **Sum the stickers from all three years to find the total number of stickers in Leo's collection:**
   \[
   \text{Total stickers} = \text{Stickers two years ago} + \text{Stickers last year} + \text{Stickers this year}
   \]
   \[

   \]

Thus, the total number of stickers in Leo's collection is:
\[
\boxed{250}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day. Since she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams each time, the daily consumption is:

\[ 60 \, \text{grams/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 120 \, \text{grams/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{120 \, \text{grams/day}} = 6 \, \text{days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate based on the information given.

1. **Total Slices of Pizza:**
   Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas.
   \[
   4 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 32 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Becky's Slices:**
   Becky ate 10 slices.

3. **Jake's Slices:**
   Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, Jake ate:
   \[
   \text{Jake's slices} = \text{Becky's slices} - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Silvia's Slices:**
   Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia ate:
   \[
   \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times \text{Jake's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ slices}
   \]

5. **Total Slices Eaten:**
   To find the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia, we add their individual slices:
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \text{ slices}
   \]

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[
\boxed{31}
\]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's time can be expressed as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the time spent by Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( D \). We do this by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part of the meal took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's time as:
\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, the time Betsy's part took is \(\boxed{58}\) minutes."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is:
   \[
   300 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: The cost is $4 per pill for 30 pills, so:
   \[
   4 \text{ dollars/pill} \times 30 \text{ pills} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so:
   \[
   6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482
\]

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is \(\boxed{482}\)."
"First, let's determine how many emails James gets in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, this means 80% of the emails do require a response.

The number of emails that require a response each day is:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. We do this by multiplying the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is:
\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - 32 classes visited.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Twice as many classes visited as on Monday.
   - Number of classes = \(2 \times 32 = 64\).

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Three times as many classes visited as on Monday.
   - Number of classes = \(3 \times 32 = 96\).

4. **Thursday:**
   - 30 classes visited.

5. **Friday:**
   - 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 \text{ (Monday)} + 64 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 96 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 30 \text{ (Thursday)} + 25 \text{ (Friday)}
\]

Adding these together step-by-step:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]

\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]

\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]

\[
222 + 25 = 247
\]

Thus, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

\[
\boxed{247}

   \]

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is \(\boxed{95}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of the pizzas they ordered:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of the small coupons and the cost of the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - Ten meatball sub sandwiches minus 3 is \(10 - 3 = 7\).
   - So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the number of meatballs in the initial order:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, 7 meatball sub sandwiches contain \(7 \times 4 = 28\) meatballs.

3. **Determine how many meatballs Mark ate:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - Each of these 4 sub sandwiches contains 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, Mark ate \(4 \times 4 = 16\) meatballs.

4. **Calculate the number of meatballs remaining after Mark ate:**
   - Initially, there were 28 meatballs.
   - After Mark ate 16 meatballs, the remaining meatballs are \(28 - 16 = 12\).

5. **Determine the number of additional meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches.
   - Each of these 3 sub sandwiches contains 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the additional 3 sub sandwiches contain \(3 \times 4 = 12\) meatballs.

6. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches:**
   - The remaining meatballs after Mark ate are 12.
   - The additional 3 sub sandwiches Sidney ordered also contain 12 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"First, we need to determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Determine the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 \times 0.5 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - Since 6 pounds is equivalent to 4 sets of 1.5 pounds (because \(6 \div 1.5 = 4\)).
   - The cost for 4 sets of 1.5 pounds is \(4 \times 6.00 = 24.00\).

Thus, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{24.00}

"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited. She invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. Adding these together gives:

\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of people who will actually attend the party is:

\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. The number of additional guests is:

\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

So, the additional cost for the guests is:

\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the initial rental fee and the additional cost gives the total cost of the party:

\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:

\[
\boxed{251}

"Let's start by determining how much money Maggie and Riza each originally had.

First, we know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left. Let \( M \) be the amount of money Maggie originally had. Since she spent a quarter of her money, she has three-quarters of her money left. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{4}M = 60
\]
To find \( M \), we solve for \( M \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[
M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]
So, Maggie originally had $80.

Next, we know that Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left. Let \( R \) be the amount of money Riza originally had. Since she spent one-third of her money, she has two-thirds of her money left. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{3}R = 60
\]
To find \( R \), we solve for \( R \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[
R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]
So, Riza originally had $90.

Now, we need to determine how much money each of them has left. Maggie has $60 left, and Riza also has $60 left. Therefore, the total amount of money they have left together is:
\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]
So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week:**
   - Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week.
   - There are 7 days in a week.

   \[
   \text{Total bananas per day} = \frac{315 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 45 \text{ bananas per day}
   \]

2. **Determine the daily banana consumption of the first monkey:**
   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

3. **Determine the daily banana consumption of the second monkey:**
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey.

   \[
   \text{Bananas eaten by the second monkey per day} = 10 \text{ bananas} + 4 \text{ bananas} = 14 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys each day:**

   \[
   \text{Total bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys per day} = 10 \text{ bananas} + 14 \text{ bananas} = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. **Determine the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey each day:**
   - The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys each day is 45.
   - Subtract the total eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption.

   \[
   \text{Bananas eaten by the third monkey per day} = 45 \text{ bananas} - 24 \text{ bananas} = 21 \text{ bananas}
   \]

Thus, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"To determine the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **First Puzzle:**
   - Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle.
   - Half of 500 pieces is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ pieces}
     \]

2. **Second Puzzle:**
   - Teddy started and finished another 500 piece puzzle.
   - Therefore, he placed all 500 pieces of the second puzzle.

3. **Total Pieces Placed:**
   - To find the total number of pieces Teddy placed, we add the pieces from both puzzles:
     \[
     250 \text{ pieces} + 500 \text{ pieces} = 750 \text{ pieces}

"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. We can compare the cost per rose in both pricing methods to determine the most economical way to buy 15 roses.

- Cost per rose when bought individually: $2 each.
- Cost for a dozen (12 roses): $15.

To find the cost of 15 roses using the individual pricing:
\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30. \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has and how much change she will receive:
- Jenny has five $5 bills, which totals:
\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25. \]

Since the cost of 15 roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to buy 15 roses at the individual price. Therefore, we need to consider the possibility of buying some roses in dozens and the rest individually.

Let's see if buying one dozen (12 roses) and the remaining 3 roses individually works:
- Cost for one dozen roses: $15.
- Cost for 3 individual roses: \(3 \times \$2 = \$6\).

Total cost for 15 roses in this scenario:
\[ \$15 + \$6 = \$21. \]

Now, we calculate the change Jenny will receive:
\[ \$25 - \$21 = \$4. \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we convert the $4 into quarters:
\[ \$4 = 4 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 400 \text{ cents}. \]
\[ 400 \text{ cents} \div 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 16 \text{ quarters}. \]

Thus, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of item sold and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the revenue from milkshakes:**
   - Terry sells 6 milkshakes.
   - Each milkshake is priced at $5.50.
   - Revenue from milkshakes = \( 6 \times 5.50 \).

\[
6 \times 5.50 = 33
\]

2. **Calculate the revenue from burger platters:**
   - Terry sells 9 burger platters.
   - Each burger platter is priced at $11.
   - Revenue from burger platters = \( 9 \times 11 \).

\[
9 \times 11 = 99
\]

3. **Calculate the revenue from sodas:**
   - Terry sells 20 sodas.
   - Each soda is priced at $1.50.
   - Revenue from sodas = \( 20 \times 1.50 \).

\[
20 \times 1.50 = 30
\]

4. **Sum the revenues from all items:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from milkshakes + Revenue from burger platters + Revenue from sodas.

\[
33 + 99 + 30 = 162
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Terry makes is \(\boxed{162}\)."
"Let's break down the schedule step by step to determine when Paul's train arrives and how long he will wait.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves 30 minutes after it arrives (10 + 20).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves 30 minutes after it arrives, so the second train arrives 30 minutes after 30 minutes, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Leaves 5 minutes after it arrives, which is 65 minutes after the first train arrives.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves 65 minutes after the first train arrives, so the third train arrives 60 minutes after 65 minutes, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes after the first train arrives.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves at 125 minutes after the first train arrives, so the fourth train arrives 20 minutes after 125 minutes, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - This is the train Paul will board.

Paul arrives at the station 10 minutes after the first train arrives, so he arrives at the station at 10 minutes after the first train arrives. The fourth train arrives 135 minutes after he arrives at the station (145 - 10 = 135).

Therefore, Paul will wait 135 minutes for his train.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{135}

"First, we need to determine how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to collect to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks required:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can determine how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the number of additional weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, let's determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Therefore, the price Mr. Rogers paid is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, the selling price to his friend is:
\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and the friend paid $1800 for it. The discount amount is:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of seconds in 4 hours is:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 14400 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create:
     \[
     14400 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create:
     \[
     5 \times 14400 = 72000 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is:

"To find Frankie's score, we start by defining the relationship between Frankie's score and Binkie's score based on the information given.

Let \( B \) represent Binkie's score, and \( F \) represent Frankie's score. According to the problem, Binkie's score is 90, so we have:
\[ B = 90 \]

The problem states that Frankie's score was 15 more than twice Binkie's score. This can be written as:
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2(90) + 15 \]

Now, perform the multiplication and addition:
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

Thus, Frankie's score is:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"
"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total distance James walked:**
   - James walked halfway to the store and then walked back home.
   - The distance from home to the store is 4 miles.
   - Halfway to the store is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
   - Therefore, the total distance James walked is \( 2 \) miles (to the halfway point) + \( 2 \) miles (back home) = \( 4 \) miles.

2. **Determine James's walking speed:**
   - James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time taken to walk the total distance:**
   - Time is calculated using the formula: \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \).
   - Substituting the values, we get: \( \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \).

Thus, the total time it took James to reach the store is \(\boxed{1}\) hour."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times 0.80 \text{ dollars per banana} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost for 10 bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars per bunch} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is the difference between the two costs:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. Therefore, the growth rate per year is:

\[
\text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, we use this growth rate to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Trekking bikes: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150 \)
   - BMX bikes: \( 15\% \times 300 = 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
   - MTB bikes: \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \)

2. **Determine the price of each type of bike:**
   - MTB: $500
   - BMX: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 500 = 250 \)
   - Trekking: $450

3. **Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Earnings from MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \)
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)

4. **Sum the earnings from all types of bikes:**
   \[
   52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250
   \]

Thus, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour day, we need to calculate the net change in the number of bales each hour and then extend that to the full 6-hour period.

1. **Calculate the number of bales made by the farmer each hour:**
   \[
   \text{Bales made per hour} = 5
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck each hour:**
   \[
   \text{Bales picked up per hour} = 3
   \]

3. **Calculate the net change in the number of bales each hour:**
   \[
   \text{Net change per hour} = \text{Bales made per hour} - \text{Bales picked up per hour} = 5 - 3 = 2
   \]

4. **Calculate the total net change over 6 hours:**
   \[
   \text{Total net change in 6 hours} = \text{Net change per hour} \times 6 = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

5. **Determine the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours:**
   Since the net change is positive, the number of bales left in the field is the total net change over the 6-hour period:
   \[
   \text{Bales left in the field} = 12
   \]

Thus, the number of bales of hay left in the field after a 6-hour day is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

This is the time spent in classes from Monday to Friday. Now, let's calculate the time spent on extra learning on Saturday and Sunday.

John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each of these days. First, we need to find out what \(\frac{1}{16}\) of 320 minutes is.

\[ \frac{320 \text{ minutes}}{16} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time on the weekend is:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time.

\[ 320 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial drop height is:
   \[
   3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
   \[
   72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
   \[
   48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:
\[
\boxed{32 \text{ feet}}
\]"
"To determine the height of the fourth child in inches, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. **First Child's Height:**
   The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert the height to inches:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second Child's Height:**
   The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
   \[
   72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third Child's Height:**
   The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Fourth Child's Height:**
   The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:

"Let's denote the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms of meat.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \). This means \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms of meat were left after the velociraptors.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is the remaining \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

So, the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was \(\boxed{1080}\) kilograms."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall.

The north and south walls are both 10 feet by 8 feet. Therefore, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are both 5 feet by 8 feet. Therefore, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together, the total area to be painted is:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can.

1. **Initial Setup:**

   - Shaken sodas: 3
   - Unshaken sodas: 12 - 3 = 9

2. **Ellen's Actions:**
   - Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Remaining total sodas: 12 - 1 = 11

3. **Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 8 - 2 = 6
   - Remaining total sodas: 11 - 3 = 8

4. **Ellen's Friend's Actions:**
   - Ellen's friend takes 1 soda from the remaining 8 sodas.

5. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - The number of shaken sodas left is 2.
   - The total number of sodas left is 8.
   - The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the ratio of the number of shaken sodas to the total number of sodas.

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

6. **Converting to Percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, multiply by 100.

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%

"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. **Determine the speed of each train:**
   - The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
   - The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:**
   - Distance traveled by the first train:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Distance traveled by the second train:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Sum the distances to find the total distance between the two trains:**
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the second biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{second biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second biggest}}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it takes \(\boxed{2}\) minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
- He also takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which totals \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes.

So, the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 30 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, the total time spent on lunch and breaks each day is 1 hour.

Now, we need to find out how much time this adds up to over 5 days:

"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Ahito ran is \(\boxed{16}\)."

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( \boxed{90} \)."

"To determine the total population of the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school by \( P \).

Since 40% of \( P \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total height contributed by the heels.
2. Determine the total number of heels.
3. Divide the total height by the total number of heels to find the average height.

First, let's calculate the total height contributed by the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height from these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height from these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
- Therefore, the total height contributed by all the heels is \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

Next, let's determine the total number of heels:
- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels and 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total number of heels is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Now, we can find the average height of the heels by dividing the total height by the total number of heels:
\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ heels}} = 3 \text{ inches}
\]

So, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\) inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days in June:**
   June has 30 days.

2. **Determine the total distance Soledad plans to hike:**
   Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles.

3. **Calculate the total distance Soledad plans to hike per day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:**
   \[
   \text{Distance per day} = 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total distance Soledad will hike in 30 days if she hikes 250 miles per day:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Determine the additional distance Soledad needs to hike to reach her goal of 9,300 miles:**
   \[
   \text{Additional distance} = 9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles}
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of additional miles Soledad must hike per day to cover the additional distance in 30 days:**
   \[
   \text{Additional miles per day} = \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional \(\boxed{60}\) miles per day to complete her journey on time."
"To determine the total amount the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the revenue from each color of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. **Red Balls:**
   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Total revenue from red balls: \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \)

2. **Blue Balls:**
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Total revenue from blue balls: \( 11 \times 5 = 55 \)

3. **Green Balls:**
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Total revenue from green balls: \( 25 \times 3 = 75 \)

"First, let's determine how much Pierre and Paul each want in kilograms.

The total amount of apples is 12 kg.

Pierre wants a quarter of the apples:
\[
\text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Paul wants one-third of the apples:
\[
\text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, we add Pierre's and Paul's shares to find out how much they have together:
\[
\text{Total share of Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Since the total amount of apples is 12 kg, we subtract the combined share of Pierre and Paul from the total to find out how many kilograms James will have left:
\[
\text{James's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"

"First, let's determine how much money Anna spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchase. Therefore, the total amount spent is:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount spent on the 2 books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and each book cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Thus, the cost of each book is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class, we start with the number of students last year and then calculate the 20% increase.

1. Last year's enrollment: 50 students.
2. Calculate 20% of 50:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10
   \]
3. Add this increase to last year's enrollment to find this year's enrollment:

   50 + 10 = 60
   \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios. The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times.

First, we set up the ratio of the number of blinks to the time taken:

\[
\frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{x \text{ minutes}}
\]

We can solve for \(x\) by cross-multiplying:

\[
255x = 459 \times 5
\]

\[
255x = 2295
\]

Next, we solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 255:

\[
x = \frac{2295}{255}
\]

\[
x = 9
\]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

\[
\boxed{9}

"First, let's determine the initial number of each type of fish in Tate's garden pond:

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Next, we account for the new fish Tate buys:

- Male guppies: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Female guppies: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
- Male goldfishes: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- Female goldfishes: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

Now, we calculate the total number of male and female fishes:

- Total male fishes: \(6\) (male guppies) + \(5\) (male goldfishes) = \(11\)
- Total female fishes: \(8\) (female guppies) + \(8\) (female goldfishes) = \(16\)

Finally, we find the difference between the number of female and male fishes:

\[ 16 - 11 = 5 \]

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes.

"First, let's determine the time each person spent on their chores.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan's chore was to walk the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time is \(4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior's chore was to do laundry, and she took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Dior's time is \(4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 9 \text{ hours}\) (since ""well over 4 hours"" means at least 5 hours, but we can use 9 as a clear example).

Now, we sum up the total time spent by all three:

\[
4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance for one trip:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance for one trip = \( 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \)

2. **Calculate the distance for a round trip:**
   - A round trip means going to his parents' place and coming back.
   - Distance for a round trip = \( 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \)

3. **Calculate the total distance for all visits in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance per month = \( 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \)

"First, let's determine how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will walk in 7 days as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let \( B \) represent the number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2 \times B \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk \(\boxed{35}\) miles in 7 days."
"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first two workers:
\[ 2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the next two workers:
\[ 2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Now, let's find the total number of toys produced by these four workers:
\[ 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer needs a total of 400 toys, and after the four workers have worked, 20 toys are still needed to complete the order. Therefore, the fifth worker must produce:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys} \]

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Thus, the number of toys per hour that the fifth worker produces is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:
\[
\boxed{105}

"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. This means that the total number of stickers Kris received from Luis is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \). So, we have \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).

Now, we solve for \( S \):
\[
\frac{S}{4} = 16 \implies S = 16 \times 4 = 64
\]

Thus, the number of stickers Seth had in the beginning is \(\boxed{64}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

\[ 3 \text{ large bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per large bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many M&M are in these 30 ounces. Since there are 30 M&M in an ounce:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M} \]

John wants to put 10 M&M in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M by the number of M&M per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M}}{10 \text{ M&M per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Therefore, John can make \(\boxed{90}\) small bags."
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance for half the circumference of the Earth:**
   The circumference of the Earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of the circumference is:
   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days required for Alfie to fly this distance:**
   Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth."
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow the given relationships step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**
   - The average car can go 120 miles per hour.

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is \(\boxed{750}\) miles per hour."
"To determine Vince's current age, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

1. Let \( V \) be Vince's current age.
2. Two years ago, Liam's age was \( 16 - 2 = 14 \) years.
3. Two years ago, Vince's age was \( V - 2 \) years.
4. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   14 = 2(V - 2)
   \]

Next, we solve this equation step by step:

1. Distribute the 2 on the right side of the equation:
   \[
   14 = 2V - 4
   \]

2. Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( V \):
   \[
   14 + 4 = 2V
   \]
   \[
   18 = 2V
   \]

3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( V \):
   \[
   V = \frac{18}{2}
   \]
   \[
   V = 9
   \]

Thus, Vince is currently \(\boxed{9}\) years old."
"Let's define the variables for the number of eggs each person painted:
- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So, we can write:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know:
- Arnold painted 13 eggs.
- Madeline painted 13 eggs.
- Camden painted 21 eggs.
- Sarah painted 9 eggs.

The problem asks how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:
\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:
\[ 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is:
\[ 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 1 pound = 16 ounces:
\[ \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine how much John makes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the length of the usable part of the tree:**
   John can make logs from 80% of the 80-foot tree.
   \[
   80\% \text{ of } 80 \text{ feet} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of 4-foot logs:**
   Each log is 4 feet long. To find out how many 4-foot logs can be made from 64 feet:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of planks from each log:**
   From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, for 16 logs:
   \[
   16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the planks:**
   Each plank is sold for $1.2. Therefore, the total revenue from 80 planks:
   \[
   80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96
   \]

Thus, the final amount John makes is:
\[
\boxed{96}

"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings as follows:

\[
\text{Brother's earnings} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much Valerie's mother earns. Her mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[
\text{Combined salary of Valerie and her brother} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the mother's earnings:

\[
\text{Mother's earnings} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add up the earnings of Valerie, her brother, and her mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The distance she covers on the beach is 2 miles. Using the formula \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \), we can find her speed on the beach:
\[
2 = v \times 40 \implies v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}
\]

Now, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:
\[
2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
\]

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \):
\[
\text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[
40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"First, we calculate the total amount Jane has saved over the past 8 weeks. Since she saves $4 each week, we multiply $4 by 8 weeks:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

So, Jane has saved $32 so far. We need to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save a total of $60. We do this by subtracting the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for her to save $28, given that she saves $4 each week. We divide $28 by $4:

\[ 28 \div 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{7}

   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

2. Calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

3. The number of blue birds in the 1 tree that had 3 blue birds is:
   \[
   3
   \]

4. Add the results from the three parts together to get the total number of blue birds:
   \[
   21 + 8 + 3 = 32
   \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Bob originally has:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to solve for the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Next, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of them. We subtract 10 from the original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, he will have \(\boxed{26}\) marbles."
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, which means the average temperature of the mixed water must be at least 40 degrees.

The total volume of water in the bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces. The total temperature of the mixed water is the sum of the temperatures of the two portions of water, which is \( 4 \times 33 + 1 \times T \).

The average temperature of the mixed water is given by:
\[
\frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):
\[
4 \times 33 = 132
\]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides of the inequality by 5:
\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Next, solve for \( T \) by subtracting 132 from both sides:
\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over that period and then sum them with the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks (since \(3 \times 7 = 21\)).
- Therefore, the total number of cows added is \(20 \times 21 = 420\).

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- Again, there are 21 days in three weeks.
- Therefore, the total number of chickens added is \(10 \times 21 = 210\).

Now, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Total number of cows after three weeks: \(50 + 420 = 470\)
- Total number of chickens after three weeks: \(20 + 210 = 230\)

Finally, we sum the total number of cows and chickens:
- Total number of animals: \(470 + 230 = 700\)

Thus, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is \(\boxed{700}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the cost is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the total cost. So, the cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   23 - 5 = 18
   \]
   So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. **Find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes:**
   It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   6 - 3 = 3 \quad \text{(potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops)}
   \]
   \[
   3 - 1 = 2 \quad \text{(scoops)}
   \]
   So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \quad \text{(potatoes per scoop)}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   Since 1 scoop requires 1.5 potatoes, 18 scoops will require:
   \[
   18 \times 1.5 = 27
   \]

So, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

1. **Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:**
   Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:**
   Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for the next 30 days.
   \[
   5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:**
   \[
   90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Convert the total number of eggs into dozens:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs,
   \[
   \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Thus, the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days is \(\boxed{20}\)."

\[60 - 51 = 9\]

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects from one tree in one year.
2. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects from all trees in one year.
3. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects from all trees in a decade (10 years).

Step 1: Number of lemons from one tree in one year.
Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree each year.

Step 2: Number of lemons from all trees in one year.
Tim grows 5 trees, so the total number of lemons collected in one year is:
\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Step 3: Number of lemons from all trees in a decade.
A decade is 10 years, so the total number of lemons collected in a decade is:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of passengers.

The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 9 = 14\).

Given that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, we can determine the number of parts each represents in the ratio. Each part of the ratio corresponds to \(\frac{84}{14} = 6\) passengers.

Now, we calculate the number of men and women on the bus:
- The number of men is \(5 \times 6 = 30\).
- The number of women is \(9 \times 6 = 54\).

Next, we account for the 20 women who alight from the bus at the next stop. The number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Thus, the number of women remaining on the bus is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"To determine Geb's age, we start by translating the given information into a mathematical equation. The problem states that Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. If Haley is 26 years old, we can express Geb's age as follows:

1. Calculate half of Haley's age:
   \[
   \frac{26}{2} = 13
   \]

2. Subtract 10 from this result to find Geb's age:
   \[
   13 - 10 = 3
   \]

Therefore, Geb is \(\boxed{3}\) years old."
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Face masks used per outing:**
   Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.

2. **Number of outings per day:**
   Tyrion goes out three times a day.

3. **Face masks used per day:**
   Since he changes his face mask two times per outing and goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ masks/outing} \times 3 \text{ outings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]

4. **Face masks used in 2 days:**
   To find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks used per day by 2:
   \[
   6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs each person finds:
- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we sum the number of eggs found by all four individuals:
\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs to find out how many are still hidden:
\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Thus, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so combined they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects from all three complexes:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1248}

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   \[
   \text{Fruits} = 50
   \]

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   \[
   \text{Fruits} = 3 \times 50 = 150
   \]

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   \[
   \text{Fruits} = 7 \times 50 = 350
   \]

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   \[
   \text{Fruits} = 200 \text{ less than a 10-year-old tree}
   \]
   Let \( x \) be the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. Then:
   \[
   \text{Fruits} = x - 200
   \]

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   \[
   \text{Fruits} = 0
   \]

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   \[
   \text{Fruits} = 20 \times 50 = 1000
   \]

Next, we need to find the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits:
\[
x = 1000
\]
Thus, the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree is:
\[
\text{Fruits} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
\]

Adding these values together:
\[
50 + 150 = 200
\]
\[
200 + 350 = 550
\]
\[
550 + 800 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 0 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 1000 = 2350
\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is:
\[
\boxed{2350}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and gave Jack \(\frac{1}{5}\) of her money. We calculate \(\frac{1}{5}\) of $100 as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
\]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Now, we need to find out how much money Jack has after receiving $20 from Sophia. Jack originally had $100. Adding the $20 from Sophia, we get:

\[
100 + 20 = 120
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jack has now is:

\[
\boxed{120}

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope in centimeters.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope in centimeters.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope in centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   R = 4B
   \]
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   B = Y - 7
   \]
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   R + B + Y = 37
   \]

First, substitute \( R = 4B \) into the combined length equation:
\[
4B + B + Y = 37
\]
Simplify this to:
\[
5B + Y = 37
\]

Next, substitute \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[
5(Y - 7) + Y = 37
\]
Distribute and combine like terms:
\[
5Y - 35 + Y = 37
\]
\[
6Y - 35 = 37
\]
Add 35 to both sides:
\[
6Y = 72
\]
Divide by 6:
\[
Y = 12
\]

Now, find \( B \) using \( B = Y - 7 \):
\[
B = 12 - 7 = 5
\]

Finally, find \( R \) using \( R = 4B \):
\[
R = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]

Thus, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"Let's start by determining how much money Rissa and Ronnie initially received. Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to her little sister. Since Ronnie also gave the same amount \( x \) to his little sister, Ronnie gave $3 to his little sister as well. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To determine how many pints of red paint were used in the mural, we start by defining the total amount of paint and the distribution among the colors.

1. **Total Paint:**
   The mural used a total of 12 pints of paint.

2. **Yellow Paint:**
   Half of the mural is yellow. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

3. **Red, White, and Purple Paint:**
   The remaining paint is used for red, white, and purple. Since the total amount of paint is 12 pints and 6 pints are yellow, the amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

4. **Equal Amounts of Red, White, and Purple:**
   The problem states that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Therefore, we divide the remaining 6 pints equally among the three colors:
   \[
   \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
   \]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:
\[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
\[ 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total area of the house is:
\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
   \[
   \text{Monday} = 3
   \]

2. **Tuesday:**
   She sees double the number of clouds as Monday.
   \[
   \text{Tuesday} = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   She sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Wednesday} = 6 \times 2 = 12
   \]

4. **Thursday:**
   She sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday.
   \[
   \text{Thursday} = 12 \times 2 = 24
   \]

5. **Friday:**
   She sees double the number of clouds as Thursday.
   \[
   \text{Friday} = 24 \times 2 = 48
   \]

Next, we sum the number of puffs counted each day to find the total for the week:
\[
\text{Total} = 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is:
\[
\boxed{93}

"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods and the special size box has 20% more pods.

Calculate 20% of 100:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. We need to find out how many pods are in the box for $1. Since the box costs $12 and contains 120 pods, the cost per pod is:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

This means that for $1, you can buy:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run:
\[ 10 \text{ dishwashing cycles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400

"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves of the match.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A. Therefore, Team B scores:
     \[
     4 - 2 = 2 \text{ goals}
     \]

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Therefore, Team B scores:
     \[
     4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ goals}
     \]
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Therefore, Team A scores:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ goals}
     \]

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A:
     \[
     4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6 \text{ goals}
     \]
   - Total goals scored by Team B:
     \[
     2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10 \text{ goals}
     \]
   - Total goals scored in the match:
     \[
     6 \text{ (Team A)} + 10 \text{ (Team B)} = 16 \text{ goals}
     \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday = \( 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day.
   - Daily usage = \( 2.75 \times 0.20 = 0.55 \) inches per day.

3. **Calculate the number of days before the chalk is recycled:**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - Remaining chalk before recycling = 2 inches.
   - Number of days before recycling = \( \frac{2.75 - 2}{0.55} = \frac{0.75}{0.55} \approx 1.36 \).

Since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 1 full day before it needs to be recycled.

**Final Answer:**
The teacher has 1 day before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."

"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount had passed the expiry date.

Calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Mr. Marcellus returned 1600 gallons of milk. The cost per gallon of milk is $3.5. To find the total refund amount, we multiply the number of gallons returned by the cost per gallon:
\[
1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 1600 \times \left(\frac{7}{2}\right) = \frac{1600 \times 7}{2} = \frac{11200}{2} = 5600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:
\[
\boxed{5600}

"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin using variables. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

**Step 1: Translate the first piece of information into an equation.**

Colin's age in seven years is \( C + 7 \). According to the problem, Wendy's current age \( W \) is five times this value:
\[
W = 5(C + 7)
\]

**Step 2: Translate the second piece of information into an equation.**

In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \). According to the problem, this age is a third of Wendy's current age \( W \):
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
\]

**Step 3: Solve the system of equations.**

We now have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7)
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]

Distribute the 3 and 5:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Solve for \( C \):
\[
C = 20
\]

**Step 4: Verify the solution.**

Substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the first equation to find \( W \):
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \cdot 27 = 135
\]

Check the second condition:
\[
C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 135 = 45
\]

Both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin's current age is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"

- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the miles run on the days Sam ran 3 miles:
- Sam ran 3 miles on Monday.
- Sam ran 3 miles on Wednesday.
- Sam ran 3 miles on Friday.

The total miles for these three days is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the miles run on the days Sam ran 5 miles:
- Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday.
- Sam ran 5 miles on Thursday.

The total miles for these two days is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we sum the miles run on all the days:
\[ 9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is:
\[
\boxed{19}

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's calculate the net rate of snowball production. Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many snowballs melt in an hour. There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, so the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is:
\[ 2 \text{ snowballs/15 minutes} \times 4 = 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

Therefore, the net rate of snowball production is:
\[ 20 \text{ snowballs/hour} - 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs at this net rate. We can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Time (hours)} \times 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 60 \text{ snowballs} \]

Solving for the time:
\[ \text{Time (hours)} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take Jay \(\boxed{5}\) hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( J \) be John's current age and \( M \) be Jim's current age. According to the problem, John is currently 28 years old, so \( J = 28 \).

The problem also states that when Digimon had its 20th anniversary, John was twice as old as Jim. Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary 20 years ago, we can express their ages 20 years ago as follows:
- John's age 20 years ago: \( J - 20 = 28 - 20 = 8 \)
- Jim's age 20 years ago: \( M - 20 \)

According to the problem, John's age 20 years ago was twice Jim's age 20 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 8 = 2(M - 20) \]

Now, we solve for \( M \):
\[ 8 = 2(M - 20) \]
\[ 8 = 2M - 40 \]
\[ 8 + 40 = 2M \]
\[ 48 = 2M \]
\[ M = \frac{48}{2} \]
\[ M = 24 \]

So, Jim's current age is \( \boxed{24} \)."
"Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **Determine the number of bandages used on the second day:**
   - On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages.
   - On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than on the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of bandages used on the second day is \(38 - 10 = 28\).

2. **Calculate the total number of bandages used by the end of the second day:**
   - Total bandages used by the end of the second day = 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) = 66.

3. **Determine the number of bandages ordered and used on the third day:**
   - On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(0.5 \times 50 = 25\) bandages.
   - Therefore, the net increase in bandages on the third day is \(100 - 25 = 75\) bandages.

4. **Calculate the total number of bandages at the end of the third day:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
   - By the end of the second day, they had \(x - 66\) bandages.
   - After ordering and using bandages on the third day, they had \(x - 66 + 75 = x + 9\) bandages.
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.
   - Therefore, \(x + 9 = 78\).

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - \(x + 9 = 78\)
   - \(x = 78 - 9\)
   - \(x = 69\)

The nurses started with \(\boxed{69}\) bandages on the first day."
"First, calculate the cost of the haircut. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the length cut off is:

Next, add the cost of the color, which is $40, to the cost of the haircut:

\[ 60 + 40 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for May's cut and color is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Jen works in April. Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate the total hours as follows:

\[
7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 180 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we calculate Jen's earnings from her hourly rate. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her earnings from her hourly work are:

\[
180 \text{ hours} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 270 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:

\[
270 \text{ dollars} + 10 \text{ dollars} = 280 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Morning Entry:**
   - 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.

2. **10:00 Entry:**
   - 40 more people entered the restaurant at around 10:00.

3. **Afternoon Entry:**
   - Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch.
   - Number of people who entered at 10:00: 40
   - Twice this number: \(2 \times 40 = 80\)

4. **Evening Entry:**
   - An additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant by evening.
   - Number of people who entered first: 50
   - 3 times this number: \(3 \times 50 = 150\)

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant throughout the day:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (afternoon)} + 150 \text{ (evening)}

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:
\[
\text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:
\[
\text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}

"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's find the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines at $72. Therefore, the selling price is:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8}
\]

To perform the multiplication:
\[
72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99
\]

So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

Thus, Trinity's profit is:

\frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:
\[
2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Now, we add the capacities of both schools to find the combined capacity:
\[
120 + 30 = 150
\]

"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest on the $300 he borrowed.

The interest amount is calculated as:
\[ 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount that Stephen needs to pay in the twelfth month is the total amount he needs to return minus the amount he has already paid:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. Therefore, the number of diaper changes she handles is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Since the total number of changes per day is 10 and Jordan's wife handles 5 of them, the number of diaper changes Jordan handles is:

\[ 10 \text{ changes} - 5 \text{ changes} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

So, Jordan changes:

\[ \boxed{5} \text{ diapers per day} \]"
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with side length 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for packing jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864
   \]

5. **Calculate the difference between the true number and the estimated number:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

Thus, Tim's guess was \(\boxed{36}\) jelly beans off."

"To determine the number of novels Regina has written this year, we start by understanding the relationship given in the problem. According to the problem, the 9 novels she wrote last year represent 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she has written this year.

Let's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \( x \). The relationship can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{3}{4} x = 9
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[
x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3}
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs to hold all 110 books, we first need to calculate the capacity of each shelf in a single bookcase.

1. **Capacity of the middle shelves:**
   Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of the middle shelves} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
   \]

2. **Capacity of the bottom shelf:**
   The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf.
   \[
   \text{Capacity of the bottom shelf} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
   \]

3. **Capacity of the top shelf:**
   The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.
   \[
   \text{Capacity of the top shelf} = 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ books}
   \]

4. **Total capacity of one bookcase:**
   Adding the capacities of all three shelves in one bookcase.
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of one bookcase} = 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books}
   \]

5. **Number of bookcases needed:**
   To find out how many bookcases are needed to hold 110 books, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase.
   \[
   \text{Number of bookcases} = \frac{110}{55} = 2
   \]

Thus, Elly needs \(\boxed{2}\) bookcases to hold all 110 books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of red hats. Since half of the hats are red, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
\]

Next, we need to find out how many hats are left after accounting for the red hats:

\[
\text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
\]

Out of these remaining hats, \(\frac{3}{5}\) are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:

\[
\text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:

\[
\text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine the cost of one bag of beef jerky after the discount. The original price of one bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the price after the discount is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each stick of beef jerky costs. Since one bag contains 30 sticks, we divide the price of the bag by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick in dollars is $0.50. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the cost per stick of beef jerky is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating the variable. First, add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. To find the number of blueberry cubes, we substitute \( S = 20 \) into the expression for the number of blueberry cubes:
\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

"To determine the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of helmets.
2. Use the given relationships to find the number of robots and footballs.
3. Sum the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.

We know from the problem statement that there are 20 helmets. Let's denote the number of helmets as \( H \), the number of robots as \( R \), and the number of footballs as \( F \). According to the problem, the number of robots is half the number of helmets, and the number of helmets is half the number of footballs. Therefore, we can write the following relationships:

\[ R = \frac{H}{2} \]
\[ H = \frac{F}{2} \]

Since \( H = 20 \), we can substitute this value into the second equation to find the number of footballs:

\[ 20 = \frac{F}{2} \]
\[ F = 20 \times 2 \]
\[ F = 40 \]

Now, we can substitute the value of \( H \) into the first equation to find the number of robots:

\[ R = \frac{20}{2} \]
\[ R = 10 \]

Now we have the number of each type of item:
- Number of robots \( R = 10 \)
- Number of helmets \( H = 20 \)
- Number of footballs \( F = 40 \)

To find the total number of items, we sum these values:

\[ \text{Total number of items} = R + H + F = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 \]

Thus, the total number of items Dominick saw is \(\boxed{70}\)."

  3 \text{ German Shepherds} \times 5 \text{ kg/day} = 15 \text{ kg/day}
  \]

Next, calculate the daily food consumption for the Bulldogs:
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is:
  \[
  2 \text{ Bulldogs} \times 3 \text{ kg/day} = 6 \text{ kg/day}
  \]

Now, add the daily consumption of both types of dogs to find the total daily consumption:
\[
15 \text{ kg/day} + 6 \text{ kg/day} = 21 \text{ kg/day}
\]

Finally, calculate the total weekly consumption by multiplying the daily total by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[
21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is:
\[
\boxed{147}

"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals.
2. Calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals.
3. Add the two totals together to get the overall number of legs.
4. Divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the number of pairs of legs.

Let's start with the 2-legged animals:
- There are 10 animals, each with 2 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

Next, let's calculate the legs from the 4-legged animals:
- There are 15 animals, each with 4 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals is \(15 \times 4 = 60\).

Now, we add the legs from both types of animals:
- The total number of legs is \(20 + 60 = 80\).

Finally, we find the number of pairs of legs by dividing the total number of legs by 2:
- The number of pairs of legs is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\).

Thus, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

1. Let the number of blue blocks be \( B \).
2. Let the number of yellow blocks be \( Y \).
3. Let the number of red blocks be \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
- The number of blue blocks \( B \) is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks \( Y \) is twice the number of blue blocks, so \( Y = 2 \times B = 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

The total number of blocks can be expressed as the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks:
\[ B + Y + R = 32 \]

Substituting the known values of \( B \) and \( Y \) into the equation:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Thus, the number of red blocks is \(\boxed{20}\)."

\[ 6 \text{ dollars/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Ryan spends on ice cream cones. He buys ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which means he buys 4 ice cream cones in total. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for the ice cream cones is:

\[ 4 \text{ cones} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/cone} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings, we find out how much money Ryan has left:

\[ 18 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \text{ dollars} \div 6.50 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 2 \text{ tickets} \]

Since the result is a whole number, Ryan can buy exactly 2 movie tickets. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine the total amount Ellen and Lani spent, we need to calculate the individual expenses and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate Ellen's total expenses:
- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.
- Ellen also bought a photo frame for $5.
So, Ellen's total expense is:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate Lani's total expenses:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100. Therefore, the cost for the bathrobes is:
\[ 100 \times 2 = 200 \]
So, Lani's total expense is:
\[ 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, we add Ellen's and Lani's total expenses to find the combined total:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

Therefore, the total amount they spent in all is:
\[
\boxed{335}

"To determine Tim's profit from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the total cost of ingredients for one jar and then for 10 jars. Finally, we'll subtract the total cost from the total revenue from selling 10 jars.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound
  \[
  2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound
  \[
  1.5 \times 8 = 12 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound
  \[
  2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost for one jar:
\[
12 + 12 + 20 = 44 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
\[
44 \times 10 = 440 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:
\[
10 \times 50 = 500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
500 - 440 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is:
\[
\boxed{60}

"To determine how much money Janet has left after her purchases, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and then subtract that from the $40 her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent:
1. Ice cream: $3.50
2. Movie tickets (for herself and her sister): $7.50 each, so $7.50 \times 2 = $15.00
3. Bracelet: $8.50

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

So, Janet spent a total of $27.00. Now, we subtract this amount from the $40 her parents gave her:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Janet has left is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. Since the dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, the total number of holes dug is:
\[ 6 \times 14 = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many holes are filled and how many are dug each day after Nate gets home. Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net change in the number of holes each day is:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ holes filled per day} \]

We need to find out how many days it takes for Nate to fill in all 84 holes. Since the net change is 3 holes filled per day, the number of days required to fill in all the holes is:
\[ \frac{84}{3} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks it takes to fill in all the holes is:

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( k \) as the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can express these as the following equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since each of the 7 pizzas is cut into 8 slices, we calculate the total number of slices as follows:
