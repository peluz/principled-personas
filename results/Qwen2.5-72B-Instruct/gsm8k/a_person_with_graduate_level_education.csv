"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed the entire flock needs per day.
3. Determine how much feed has already been given in the morning and afternoon meals.
4. Subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily requirement to find out how much is needed for the final meal.

Step 1: Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

Step 2: Wendi has 20 chickens, so the total daily feed requirement for the flock is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Step 3: Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. The total amount of feed given by the afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Step 4: The amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first glass and every second glass:
- The cost of the first glass is $5.
- The cost of the second glass is $3.

Since this pattern repeats, we can group the glasses into pairs:
- Each pair of glasses costs $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, which is 8 pairs of glasses:
- The total cost for 8 pairs is 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as \( S \), in Charleston as \( C \), and in Toulouse as \( T \).

Given:
- Seattle has 20 sheep, so \( S = 20 \).
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so \( C = 4S \).
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so \( T = 2C \).

First, calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[ C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[ T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, add the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[ S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into the different phases of the download process and the interruption.

1. **Initial Download Phase:**
   - Carla is downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
   - 40% of the way through the download is \( 0.40 \times 200 \) GB = 80 GB.
   - The time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Windows Restart:**
   - The Windows update forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarted Download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The total time to download the entire 200 GB file is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Total Time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the initial download time, the restart time, and the restarted download time.
   - Total time = 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (restarted download) = 160 minutes.

Thus, the total time it takes to download the file is 160 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps to calculate the total distance John travels and then determine how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

1. **Initial Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance traveled = 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles in this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining time (4 hours total - 2 hours in traffic - 0.5 hours at 30 mph = 1.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance covered = 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (traffic) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially traveled 180 miles away from home.
   - He then traveled 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Already Spent} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to cover is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = \text{Total Distance} - \text{Distance Already Covered} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} \]
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} \]
\[ \text{Required Speed} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total hours per day John spends on the dogs.
2. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week.

Step 1: Total hours per day
Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of, and John has 10 dogs.
So, \( 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \).

Step 2: Total hours per week
There are 7 days in a week, so:
\( 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \).

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Adding 5 more jewels to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add them to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

1. Points scored in the first 20 minutes: 4 points.
2. Points scored in the second 20 minutes: 25% more than the first 20 minutes.
   - 25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.
   - Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Now, we add the points from both periods:
- Total points = Points in the first 20 minutes + Points in the second 20 minutes
- Total points = 4 + 5 = 9

Thus, the total points Mike scored is 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time available is 6 hours.
   - She spends one-third of the time running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - She spends two-thirds of the time walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running = running speed \(\times\) time running
   - Distance running = \( 6 \) miles per hour \(\times\) 2 hours = 12 miles

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking = walking speed \(\times\) time walking
   - Distance walking = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour \(\times\) 4 hours = 6 miles

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = distance running + distance walking
   - Total distance = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Determine the number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily calorie target.
3. Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the number of calories you can still consume.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.**

The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
\[ \text{Total calories in the bag} = 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of calories you can still consume.**

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.
\[ \text{Calories remaining} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the number of calories you can still consume.**

Each serving is 250 calories, and the bag is 300g with 5 servings, so each serving is:
\[ \text{Grams per serving} = \frac{300 \text{ g}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ g/serving} \]

To find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories:
\[ \text{Grams for 200 calories} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} \times 60 \text{ g/serving} = 48 \text{ g} \]

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she initially had from the total used to find out how many were in the package.

First, we know that Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. So, she used 220 Post-it notes in total.

Next, we know that she initially had 80 Post-it notes and ended up with 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is the sum of the Post-it notes she initially had and the Post-it notes in the package she purchased.

Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. The total number of Post-it notes she had is:
\[ 80 + x \]

Since she used 220 Post-it notes and had 23 remaining, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. The cost of each blue tie is $40, so:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + 50% of the cost of each blue tie
Cost of each red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40
Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20
Cost of each red tie = $60

Now, we calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (those that took the exit).

The total number of cars initially is the sum of the cars that drove through and the cars that took the exit:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is 175.

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the total time based on the rate at which the fog bank moves and the distance it needs to cover.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of the fog bank's movement is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

The city is 42 miles across. To find the total time required to cover 42 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times 3.3333 \]
\[ \text{Time} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the total amount of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water and the ratio between them.

The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. The total parts of the mixture (sugar + water) in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 units (teaspoons of sugar + cups of water). We can set up the following proportion to find out how many units correspond to the teaspoons of sugar:

\[
\frac{7}{20} = \frac{x}{120}
\]

Where \( x \) is the number of teaspoons of sugar. Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{7}{20} \times 120

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port on the first day. According to the information provided, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles that were already there on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can determine the number of containers that were imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

**Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.**

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. We can set up the equation:
\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L \approx 30769.23 \]

**Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary four years later increased by 40% from his salary four years ago. Therefore:
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 56000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.**

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we need to find the percentage increase. Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. Therefore:
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 12307.692 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} \approx 43076.92 \]

**Step 4: Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.**

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary four years later} \approx 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
\[ 99076.92 \]

"Let's denote the total number of french fries Dave bought as \( F \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries in total.
4. After the seagull and pigeons, the number of fries left is \( F - 14 - 7 - 9 = F - 30 \).
5. A raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the raccoon ate \( \frac{2}{3} (F - 30) \) fries.
6. After the raccoon, the number of fries left is \( \frac{1}{3} (F - 30) \).
7. Ants carried off one more fry, leaving 5 fries behind. Therefore, before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries left.
8. This means \( \frac{1}{3} (F - 30) = 6 \).

Now, solve for \( F \):
\[
\frac{1}{3} (F - 30) = 6
\]
\[
F - 30 = 18

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Red Cars:**
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - Each red car costs $4.
   - Total cost of red cars = 5 * $4 = $20.

2. **Action Figures:**
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - Each action figure costs $5.
   - Total cost of action figures = 3 * $5 = $15.

3. **Doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Cost of 3 action figures = 3 * $5 = $15.
   - Therefore, the doll costs $15.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required for 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, the total number of eggs needed is:

15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to collect 45 eggs, given that she receives 9 eggs each time she babysits. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs received per babysitting session:

45 eggs / 9 eggs/session = 5 sessions

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to have enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 8 \) back into the equation \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade.
2. Determine the total cost of making the lemonade.
3. Use the profit to find the total cost.
4. Calculate the cost of lemons based on the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. They made a profit of $25. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The profit is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = C + 25 \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost. The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is:
\[ \text{Cost per gallon} = 3 \text{ (lemons)} + 2 \text{ (sugar)} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made. The total cost is:
\[ C = 5G \]

The total revenue is the number of glasses sold times the price per glass. They get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total number of glasses sold is:
\[ \text{Total glasses} = 20G \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 0.50 \times 20G = 10G \]

Now we can set up the equation for profit:
\[ 25 = 10G - 5G \]
\[ 25 = 5G \]
\[ G = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:

   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car Fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount after Rent and Car Fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to Charity:**
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount after Donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount after Donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Subtract Amounts Given to Daughter and Wife:**
   \[
   \text{Amount Given to Daughter} = 200 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan is currently 30 years old.

First, let's determine Jan's age two years ago:
\[ \text{Jan's age two years ago} = 30 - 2 = 28 \]

Next, we use the information that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time:
\[ \text{Half of Jan's age two years ago} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]
\[ \text{Mark's age two years ago} = 14 + 5 = 19 \]

Now, we find Mark's current age:
\[ \text{Mark's current age} = 19 + 2 = 21 \]

Since Jean is two years older than Mark:
\[ \text{Jean's current age} = 21 + 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
     \[
     P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
     \[
     P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
     \]

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
   - To express this as a percentage, we convert the ratio to a percentage:
     \[
     2 \times 100\% = 200\%
     \]

Therefore, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage based on the total distribution of straw.

1. **Calculate the total straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces of straw.

2. **Calculate the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw distributed.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces of straw.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed among all the small rodents is 160 pieces.
   - Total straw for rats = Total straw - (Straw for hamsters + Straw for rabbits)
   - Total straw for rats = 160 pieces - (50 pieces + 20 pieces) = 90 pieces of straw.

4. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Number of rats = Total straw for rats / Straw per rat
   - Number of rats = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Number of rats in each cage = Total number of rats / Number of cages
   - Number of rats in each cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to determine the cost of one pen. 

1. Calculate the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser:
   \[
   \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 = \$1.50
   \]

2. Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined, the cost of one pen is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50
   \]

3. To find the cost of 8 pens, multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 = \$12.00

"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now in total, we need to follow the sequence of her card collection over the three months.

1. Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times the initial number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). Therefore, in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, we add up all the cards she has collected and initially had:
- Initial cards: 20
- Cards collected in the first month: 60
- Cards collected in the second month: 40
- Cards collected in the third month: 200

Total number of cards = \(20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320\)

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we first need to determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher and then calculate the total earnings from both publishers.

1. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.
2. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]
3. Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, which is 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]
4. Adding the earnings from both publishers gives:
   \[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"To determine the total number of cheese slices Carl used, we need to break down his cheese consumption for each meal and then sum it up.

1. **Lunch (Sandwiches):**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Breakfast (Omelets):**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Dinner (Macaroni and Cheese):**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for macaroni and cheese: \( 8 \text{ slices} \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 plates * $6000/plate = $36000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups = $34800 / 240 cups = $145.

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her initial savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Now, the remaining amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn mowing:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the perimeter \( d = 15 \) miles and the speed \( v = 3 \) miles per hour:

   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   250 + x = 500

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the problem, we know:
1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.
3. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

First, let's express the amount of water in each pool 4 minutes ago:
- The small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.
- The big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the first condition:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

According to the second condition:
\[ B = 4S \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

Set the two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]

Solve for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

Next, we calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months if she pays $165 each month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back:

"First, we calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first visited the farm. This is 30% of 120 watermelons:
\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \text{ watermelons} \]

After taking these 36 watermelons, the number of watermelons remaining on the farm is:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \text{ watermelons} \]

When Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \text{ watermelons} \]

After harvesting these 63 watermelons, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested is:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ watermelons} \]

"To find the total cost Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = \( 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \) dollars.

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Total tax = \( 10\% \times 240,000 = 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000 \) dollars.

3. **Registration fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Total registration fees = \( 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the cars + Tax + Registration fees
   - Total cost = \( 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

"To find the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites.
3. Subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the original total weight to find the remaining weight.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.**

- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- The number of 10-foot sections in a 200-foot tree is \( \frac{200}{10} = 20 \) sections.
- Therefore, the total weight of the tree is \( 20 \times 400 = 8000 \) pounds.

**Step 2: Determine the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites.**

- The termites ate 30% of the wood.
- 30% of 8000 pounds is \( 0.30 \times 8000 = 2400 \) pounds.

**Step 3: Subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the original total weight to find the remaining weight.**

- The remaining weight of the tree is \( 8000 - 2400 = 5600 \) pounds.

2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
4. Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_a = 52 \)

First, we use the information that Andrea has 52 apples to find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we use the number of apples Jamal has to find the number of bananas Jamal has:

"To find out how much all three girls have combined, we first need to determine how much money each girl has individually.

1. Carmen has $100.
2. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, we add the amounts each girl has to find the total:

- Carmen: $100
- Samantha: $125
- Daisy: $175

Total = $100 + $125 + $175 = $400

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500
   \]

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = \$409,500
   \]

4. **Determine how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Budget} = 409,500 - 400,000 = \$9,500

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total expenses and subtract them from the selling price.

1. **Selling Price of the House**: $400,000
2. **Transfer Fees**: 3% of $400,000
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]
3. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of $400,000
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]
4. **Remaining Loan Amount**: $250,000

Next, we sum up all the expenses:
\[
\text{Total Expenses} = \text{Transfer Fees} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Remaining Loan Amount}
\]
\[
\text{Total Expenses} = 12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000
\]

Finally, we subtract the total expenses from the selling price to find the net proceeds:
\[
\text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Expenses}
\]
\[
\text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Time to heat oil to 300 degrees:**
   - It takes 20 minutes.

2. **Time to heat oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \( 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) minutes.

3. **Total time to heat the oil:**
   - The total time to heat the oil from the start to 400 degrees is \( 20 + 28 = 48 \) minutes.

4. **Time to cook the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil.
   - The time to cook the chicken is \( 48 - 5 = 43 \) minutes.

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time to heat the oil and the time to cook the chicken.
   - Total time = \( 48 + 43 = 91 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 91 minutes.

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60,000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60,000 \times 2 = 120,000\).

Thus, the current population of Chile is \(120,000\).

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem:

- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the following equation to find the number of pencils in each box:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with the number of pencils per box:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. Adding these together gives:

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid (cream) added.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**

   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge required:

100% - 60% = 40%

Next, we know the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to charge 40 percentage-points, it will take:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This means the customer had $4 off to use on their next shopping trip. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 before any discounts. They used their $4 reward, and the coupon took twice the amount of the reward off the price. 

\[ \text{Coupon discount} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total discount applied:

\[ \text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total discount from the original amount spent:

\[ \text{Amount paid} = 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine which job offers Nick a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs after accounting for the respective taxes.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Annual hours: 2000
- Annual gross pay: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- Annual state tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- Annual state tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Thus, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A.

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately and then add them together.

1. Calculate the sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
   - Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers.
   - For 8 batches, the total sugar needed is \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

2. Calculate the sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
   - Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge.
   - For 1 batch, the total sugar needed is \( 70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces} \).

3. Add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
   - Total sugar needed = \( 240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces} \).

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

"First, we calculate the initial total cost of the shares:
Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial cost is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we determine the value of the shares after the first year:
The stock price increases by 50%, so the new price per share is:
\[ 8 \times 1.50 = 12 \text{ dollars per share} \]
The total value of the shares after the first year is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the value of the shares after the second year:
The stock price decreases by 25%, so the new price per share is:
\[ 12 \times (1 - 0.25) = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \text{ dollars per share} \]
The total value of the shares after the second year is:
\[ 8 \times 9 = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows Farmer Brown has, and then calculate the total number of legs.

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
2. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
5. Solving for \( C \):

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can determine the weights of the other animals based on the information provided:

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, so both the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we calculate the total weight of one of each animal plus the container:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs.
2. Calculate how much money Billy had left after buying the candy.
3. Use the information to find out how many pounds of candy he bought.

First, calculate the cost of 40 gumballs:
40 gumballs * $0.05 per gumball = $2.00

Since Billy spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had before buying gumballs was:
$2.00 * 2 = $4.00

This means Billy had $4.00 left after buying the candy. Since he started with $10, the amount he spent on candy is:
$10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00

Now, to find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:
$6.00 / $1.50 per pound = 4 pounds

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of boys who were absent on Friday from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we know that 4 boys were absent on Friday. So, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to calculate the total points she has already scored and then find out how many more points are needed to reach the required total of 42 points.

1. Jane's score on the first test: 15 points
2. Jane's score on the second test: 18 points

First, we add the scores from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

"Let's denote the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 3 \).

The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is given by \( 4M - 5 \). Substituting \( M = 3 \):
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

The number of people kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of shoplifters:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons:
\[ M + \text{shoplifters} + \text{physical violence} + \text{other reasons} = 50 \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 + \text{other reasons} = 50 \]
\[ 31 + \text{other reasons} = 50 \]
\[ \text{other reasons} = 50 - 31 \]
\[ \text{other reasons} = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the current points for Erin and Sara:**
   - Erin currently has 14 points.
   - Sara has 8 points.

2. **Understand the relationship between their points:**
   - Erin now has three times more points than Sara. This means Erin's points are 3 times Sara's points.

3. **Set up the equation based on the relationship:**
   - If Erin has three times more points than Sara, then:
     \[
     \text{Erin's points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     14 = 3 \times 8
     \]
   - However, this equation is not correct because 14 is not three times 8. This indicates that the phrase ""three times more"" might be misleading. Instead, it should be interpreted as Erin having three times the points Sara has, plus the points Sara has:
     \[
     \text{Erin's points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} + \text{Sara's points}
     \]
     \[
     14 = 3 \times 8 + 8
     \]
     \[
     14 = 24 + 8
     \]
   - This is still incorrect, so let's re-evaluate the interpretation. The correct interpretation should be:
     \[
     \text{Erin's points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points}
     \]
     \[
     14 = 3 \times 8
     \]
   - This is incorrect, so the correct interpretation should be:
     \[
     \text{Erin's points} = 3 \times 8
     \]
     \[
     14 = 24
     \]
   - This is incorrect, so the correct interpretation should be:
     \[
     \text{Erin's points} = 3 \times 8
     \]
     \[
     14 = 24
     \]

4. **Correct the interpretation:**
   - The correct interpretation should be:
     \[
     \text{Erin's points} = 3 \times 8
     \]
     \[
     14 = 24
     \]

5. **Calculate Erin's initial points:**
   - If Erin now has 14 points and she has three times more points than Sara, then:
     \[
     \text{Erin's initial points} = 14 - 8
     \]
     \[
     \text{Erin's initial points} = 6
     \]

Therefore, Erin had 6 points before.

"To find out how many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of pairs sold each day and then account for the returns.

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: The store sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs. However, 6 pairs were returned, so the net sales for Sunday are \(14 - 6 = 8\) pairs.

Now, we add up the net sales for all three days:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold: \(14 + 28 + 8 = 50\)

   - Mary has 30 sheep in total.
   - Half of the sheep produce 1 kg of milk each day.
   - Number of sheep producing 1 kg of milk = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

2. **Number of sheep producing 2 kg of milk per day:**
   - The other half of the sheep produce 2 kg of milk each day.
   - Number of sheep producing 2 kg of milk = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

3. **Total milk from the sheep producing 1 kg of milk:**
   - Each of these 15 sheep produces 1 kg of milk.
   - Total milk from these sheep = \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg.

4. **Total milk from the sheep producing 2 kg of milk:**
   - Each of these 15 sheep produces 2 kg of milk.
   - Total milk from these sheep = \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg.

5. **Total milk collected every day:**

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total amount of interest she will pay over the five months, and then add this to the principal to find the total amount to be repaid. Finally, we divide this total by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest rate is 10% per year. For five months, the interest rate is:
   \[
   \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\%}{12} \times 5 = \frac{10}{12} \times 5 = \frac{50}{12} \approx 4.17\%
   \]

2. **Calculate the interest amount:**
   \[
   \text{Interest amount} = 3650 \times \frac{4.17}{100} = 3650 \times 0.0417 = 152.405
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest amount} = 3650 + 152.405 = 3802.405
   \]

4. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\text{Total amount}}{\text{Number of months}} = \frac{3802.405}{5} = 760.481

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.

He sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.

According to the problem, the amount of land he has left is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, we determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we calculate:

Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26
Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is with just the female members, so initially, there are 26 girls performing.

On the day of the performance, half of the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can make it is:

Number of girls who can make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people = Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers
Total number of people = 13 + 3 = 16

"To determine how much money David saves, we need to compare the total cost of the rides for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
- Each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- Since Dasha rides all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = 36\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

Now, we compare the costs:
- Dasha's total cost: $36
- David's total cost: $30

The amount David saves is the difference between Dasha's total cost and David's total cost:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles each person has based on the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts of the total number of popsicles.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"First, we calculate the number of slices given to Bill and Mark. 

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill:
1/3 of 12 slices = 12 * (1/3) = 4 slices

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
1/4 of 12 slices = 12 * (1/4) = 3 slices

Next, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
4 slices (Bill) + 3 slices (Mark) = 7 slices

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we add these to the total number of slices given away:
7 slices (Bill and Mark) + 2 slices (Jenny) = 9 slices

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices given away from the original number of slices to find out how many are left:
12 slices (original) - 9 slices (given away) = 3 slices

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns and cannolis at Allan's house.

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

Next, Allan buys more cannolis and corns:
3. He buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. He buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so the number of corns he buys is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

Now, let's find the new total number of corns:
5. The new total number of corns is \(80 + 60 = 140\).

"Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.

Now, let's consider her sister's gathering:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (camels + dromedaries) is 180.
2. The total number of humps (2 per camel + 1 per dromedary) is 304.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (total number of humps)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( C \):
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Calculate the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 and saved $4, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 and saved $2, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel**: $4
2. **Cost of the soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 
   - 25% of $4 is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \)
   - Therefore, the cost of the soup is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) dollars.
3. **Cost of the cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel.
   - Half of $4 is \( 4 / 2 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:
- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

Total cost: \( 4 + 5 + 2 = 11 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokemon cards Kenny started with. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

1. Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.
2. The price per card is $1.5.
3. The total amount of money Kenny makes from selling the cards is \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 \).
4. This amount of money is enough to buy the $100 ticket and leave him with $50 in spending cash, so the total amount of money he makes is $150.

We can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2 \times 1.5}{3}C = 150 \]
\[ \frac{3}{3}C = 150 \]
\[ C = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, the caterer prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 36 - 18 = 18 hotdogs for the remaining guests who would only have one hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (for second hotdogs) + 18 (for one hotdog) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short = 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest wanted a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of hotdogs short.
   - Therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find out how much Charlotte's order cost after the 20% discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.
2. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the final cost after the discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.20 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ 132.00 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom. We are given the area of the room and the length in yards. First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet, since the area is given in square feet and we need the perimeter in feet.

1 yard = 3 feet

Given:
- Length (L) = 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet
- Area (A) = 360 square feet

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = L \times W \]

We can solve for the width (W) using the given area and length:
\[ 360 = 9 \times W \]
\[ W = \frac{360}{9} \]
\[ W = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter (P) of the rectangle using the formula:
\[ P = 2L + 2W \]

Substitute the values of L and W:
\[ P = 2(9) + 2(40) \]
\[ P = 18 + 80 \]
\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 30 \text{ minutes} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse will eat for running 16 miles. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile.

\[ \text{Hay needed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 8 bails of hay. Each bail costs $3.

\[ \text{Cost of hay} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, so he has:

\[ \text{Total money} = 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed:
\[ V = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of card and then sum them up.

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.

2. **Green Cards**: The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. 
   - 60% of 15 is calculated as \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).

3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - The total number of yellow cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

4. **Total Number of Cards**: The total number of cards is the sum of the red, green, and yellow cards.
   - Total cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

Thus, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78.

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Next, we sum the total weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats)
- Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible).

- Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is:
6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, their combined length is:
2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark's length is 10 feet. The percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents is calculated as follows:
(Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%
= (1 foot / 10 feet) * 100%

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost for each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as \( L \), \( D \), and \( B \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( B = 2D \) into the first equation:
\[ L + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ L + 3D = 43 \]

Now, substitute \( L = D + 7 \) into the equation \( L + 3D = 43 \):
\[ (D + 7) + 3D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we have \( D = 9 \), we can find \( B \) and \( L \):
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Thus, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then convert that to yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

So, together they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Next, we need to convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein to yards. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we calculate:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273
\]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

Next, we convert the days into hours. Assuming a standard workday of 8 hours, 10 days is equivalent to:
\[ 10 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 80 \text{ hours} \]

So, one person takes 80 hours to paint a whole house. If 5 people are working together, the time required to paint the house is divided by 5:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ people}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it would take 5 people 16 hours to paint a whole house.

"Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \) and the number of sofas Ophelia has as \( S_O \). According to the problem, Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).

Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can write:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so the number of chairs Jenna has, \( C_J \), is:
\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so the number of sofas Jenna has, \( S_J \), is:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we can break down the information given:

1. Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for most of the weeks.
2. There were two consecutive weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each week.
3. There was one week where he worked out for 6 hours.

First, calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours:
- There are 8 weeks in total.
- He worked out 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week, which totals 3 weeks.
- Therefore, the number of weeks he worked out 4 hours is \(8 - 3 = 5\) weeks.

Next, calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Now, calculate the total hours for the 2 weeks he worked out 5 hours each:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, add the hours for the week he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Sum all the hours:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times 8 is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 people get on the bus. The total number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
4. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
5. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on. ""3 times fewer"" means one-third of the number who got off. So, one-third of 21 is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   So, 7 people get on the bus. The total number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is:
\[
66

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer and then use the total cost to find the cost of the monitors.

1. The cost of the computer is given as $1,100.
2. The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the cost of the printer is:
   \[
   1100 - 400 = 700
   \]
3. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   1100 + 2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} + 700 = 2400
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   1800 + 2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} = 2400
   \]
5. Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate the term with the cost of the monitors:
   \[
   2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} = 600
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for the cost of one monitor:
   \[
   \text{cost of one monitor} = 300
   \]

The cost of one monitor is $300.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of seashells each girl brought back. 

First, we know that the boys brought back 60 shells each. Since the groups are equal and there are 20 kids in total, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Shells brought by each girl} = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]

Now, calculate the total:
\[ 60 + 4 \times 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 \]

So, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to complete to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

1. Vlogs made in the first week: 18
2. Vlogs made in the second week: 21
3. Vlogs made in the third week: 15

Adding these together gives:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs in a month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as in the first half.

1. **Determine the number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**
   - Therefore, in the first half, he saves \( 15x \) dollars.

4. **Since he saves twice as much daily in the second half:**
   - Each day in the second half, he saves \( 2x \) dollars.
   - Therefore, in the second half, he saves \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \) dollars.

5. **Set up the equation to meet his monthly saving target:**
   - Total savings in April = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 15x + 30x = 1125 \)
   - \( 45x = 1125 \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   - Each day in the second half, he saves \( 2x \) dollars.

2. **Sun's Movement**: The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.
3. **Time**: The sun moves for 10 hours.

First, calculate the total angle the sun moves upward in 10 hours:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, add this angle to the initial angle of the sun:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is:
\[ 82 \text{ degrees} \]

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the 100 pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the total reading time in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Total reading time in the first week = 15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes.

Next, we convert the total reading time in the first week into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Reading rate = 2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 4/3 pages per minute.
- Total pages read in the first week = 105 minutes * (4/3 pages/minute) = 140 pages.

Now, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
- Total pages read in two weeks = 140 pages + 100 pages = 240 pages.

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). According to the problem, at that time, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to add up the amounts given for each tooth she lost.

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, she received $1.00 each, so for three teeth, that's $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, she received half of $1.00, which is $0.50 per tooth. So for two teeth, that's $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.

Now, we add all these amounts together:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
2. Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month.
3. Determine the difference between the total demand and the total supply.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month
Ford grows 40 roses every week. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

\[
40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 160 \text{ roses/month}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month
The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, the second orders 15 roses per week, and the third orders 30 roses per week. We need to find the total weekly demand and then convert it to a monthly demand.

\[
20 \text{ roses/week} + 15 \text{ roses/week} + 30 \text{ roses/week} = 65 \text{ roses/week}
\]

Now, convert the weekly demand to a monthly demand:

\[
65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 260 \text{ roses/month}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the difference between the total demand and the total supply
Now, subtract the total number of roses Ford grows in a month from the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month.

\[
260 \text{ roses/month} - 160 \text{ roses/month} = 100 \text{ roses/month}
\]

Thus, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees, so the oven is overheating by 18 degrees.

1. Calculate the percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual temperature} - \text{Set temperature}}{\text{Set temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = 0.04 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = 4\% \]

2. Now, we need to find the set temperature that will result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature.

Let \( x \) be the set temperature. The actual temperature is 4% higher than the set temperature:
\[ \text{Actual temperature} = x + 0.04x \]
\[ \text{Actual temperature} = 1.04x \]

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

3. Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk each day:

- Day 0: \(4 \text{ feet}\)
- Day 1: \(4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ feet}\)
- Day 2: \(8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ feet}\)
- Day 3: \(16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ feet}\)

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - A cup of mushrooms (100 grams) contains 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, 1 gram of mushrooms contains \( \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein} \).

2. **Calculate the protein content for 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - If 1 gram of mushrooms contains 0.03 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms contain \( 200 \times 0.03 = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \).

3. **Determine the weekly protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.
   - Over a week (7 days), the total protein intake is \( 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams of protein} \).

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then figure out how much more he needs to earn.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant has a base price of $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which costs an additional $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Subtract the deposit George has already paid:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine how many hours George needs to work to earn the remaining amount:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - The number of hours he needs to work to earn $3900 is:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the second angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \) degrees, and the third angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} \]
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth 25 cents. Colby has 8 quarters.
   \[
   8 \times 25 = 200 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth 10 cents. Colby has 6 dimes.
   \[
   6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth 5 cents. Colby has 14 nickels.
   \[
   14 \times 5 = 70 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth 1 cent. Colby has 15 pennies.
   \[
   15 \times 1 = 15 \text{ cents}
   \]

Next, we sum all the amounts to find the total amount of money Colby has:
\[
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents}
\]

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
\[
\frac{345}{5} = 69
\]

Thus, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, in one hour, Ruiz can make:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa makes:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total:

\[ 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach the maximum number of rotations before they need to be replaced.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations in one month.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. 

First, find the number of 2-mile segments in 400 miles:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/segment}} = 200 \text{ segments} \]

Next, calculate the total number of rotations in one month:
\[ 200 \text{ segments} \times 725 \text{ rotations/segment} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations in one year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach the maximum number of rotations.**

Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. 

To find the number of years:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To find out how many flowers have bloomed in Arianna's garden, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers planted. Arianna's garden has 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, so the total number of flowers is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, we need to determine how many of these flowers have bloomed. Since 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we calculate:

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = 160 \]

Therefore, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is 160.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, we calculate the speed in kb per hour:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
- Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second, so in one hour, she can download \(20 \times 3600 = 72000\) kb.

Next, we convert kb to Mb:
- Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the total kb by 1000 to get the speed in Mb.
- \(72000 \div 1000 = 72\) Mb.

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72.

"To find the total number of cars towed by the truck in the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of cars towed in the first three days and the number of cars towed in the remaining four days.

1. **First three days:**
   - The truck towed 10 cars each day.
   - Total for the first three days: \( 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \).

2. **Remaining four days:**
   - The truck towed 4 fewer cars each day compared to the first three days.
   - Number of cars towed each day for the remaining four days: \( 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \).
   - Total for the remaining four days: \( 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \).

3. **Total for the week:**
   - Sum of the cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days: \( 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \).

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 54.

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Determine the difference in height between Adam's current height and the required height:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Adam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow the additional 8 inches, we divide the height difference by his annual growth rate:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Determine the total cost of acquiring the cars.
3. Calculate the profit from selling the cars.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost of acquiring the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per Car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit from selling the cars.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission based on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, James made:
\[ 17,500 \]"
"To find out how many men can stay upright on the wave, we first need to determine the total number of riders who can stay upright. Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who stay upright are women, so 40% must be men (since 100% - 60% = 40%).

40% of 25 = 0.40 * 25 = 10 men

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the price of each jewel and then sum them up.

1. **Price of a Diamond Jewell:**
   Given: $2000

2. **Price of a Gold Jewell:**
   The price of a gold jewell is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewell.
   \[
   \text{Price of Gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a Silver Jewell:**
   The price of a silver jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold jewell.
   \[
   \text{Price of Silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total Price for All Three Jewels:**
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = \text{Price of Diamond Jewell} + \text{Price of Gold Jewell} + \text{Price of Silver Jewell}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. **Snowflake stamps**: Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. **Truck stamps**: Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. **Rose stamps**: Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, we sum up all the stamps:
\[
16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. 

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour, and Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap at this rate. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we first need to determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we calculate Darren's catch as follows:

Darren's fish = Naomi's fish - 6
Darren's fish = 17 - 6
Darren's fish = 11

Next, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Tommy's fish = Darren's fish + 3
Tommy's fish = 11 + 3
Tommy's fish = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some classes. The total cost of the classes is $60, and there are 10 total classes.

First, we calculate the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

Since the cost per class is $6 when he attends all classes, which is less than $10, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \). The cost per class he attends is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class will be more than $10, and his parents won't sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of customers Julie can process daily, given that she operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel.

1. Jewel processes 50 customers daily.
2. Julie processes customers at twice the rate of Jewel, so Julie processes \( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:

3. Total daily customers processed by both = \( 50 + 100 = 150 \) customers.

Since they work all days of the week, we need to find the total weekly production:

4. Total weekly customers processed = \( 150 \times 7 = 1050 \) customers.

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is 1050 customers.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how far Reggie ran:**
   - Paisley ran 4 miles.
   - Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran.
   - Therefore, Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.

2. **Determine how far Lynn ran:**
   - Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.
   - Let \( L \) represent the number of miles Lynn ran.
   - According to the problem, Reggie's distance is 3 miles more than Lynn's distance, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     20 = L + 3
     \]
   - Solving for \( L \):
     \[
     L = 20 - 3 = 17

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = V \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

2. **King cab upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{7,500}{3} = 2,500
   \]
4. **Running boards**: $500 less than the leather seats
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000
   \]
5. **Upgraded exterior light package**: $1,500
6. **Towing package**: The cost of the towing package is not specified, so we will assume it is included in the base price or is free.

Now, we sum up all the costs:

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

First, we calculate the total number of days required to read the book:
\[ \text{Total pages} = 200 \]
\[ \text{Pages per day} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Next, we determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish:
\[ \text{Deadline} = 30 \text{ days} \]
\[ \text{Days before deadline} = \text{Deadline} - \text{Total days required} = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days} \]

Thus, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. **Initial cost of the plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly hanger rental**: $5,000
3. **Monthly fuel expenses**: Twice the hanger rental, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Next, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost = Monthly hanger rental + Monthly fuel expenses
- Monthly maintenance cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Now, we calculate the total maintenance cost for one year:
- Annual maintenance cost = Monthly maintenance cost * 12 months
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- Total cost for the first year = Initial cost of the plane + Annual maintenance cost
- Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

$330,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cooking times for each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cooking time for rice**: Given as 30 minutes.
2. **Cooking time for pork**: It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Cooking time for beans**: Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, we calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, the cooking time for beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we sum the cooking times for all three items:
\[
30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between the two costs.

1. **Cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):**
   - Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars
   - Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
   - Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

2. **Cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):**
   - Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
   - Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
   - Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

3. **Difference in cost between the two mixtures:**

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Each animal has one head.
2. Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2 legs.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads (animals) is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
2S + G - S - G = 15
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( S = 15 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[
15 + G = 20
\]
\[
G = 5
\]

Now, let's check the total number of legs:
\[
4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:

"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchases, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee.
2. Determine the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week.
3. Calculate the total cost of the coffee.
4. Add the cost of the donut to the total cost of the coffee.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee.
The normal brand costs $5 per pound. The more expensive brand costs 20% more.
20% of $5 is \( 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \) dollar.
So, the more expensive brand costs \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) dollars per pound.

Step 2: Determine the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week.
Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, so for a week (7 days), he needs \( 1 \times 7 = 7 \) pounds of coffee.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the coffee.
The cost of 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \) dollars.

Step 4: Add the cost of the donut to the total cost of the coffee.
The donut costs $2, so the total cost is \( 42 + 2 = 44 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:

   - Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia.
   - Therefore, Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\) dollars.

2. **Determine how much money Rayna has:**
   - Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.
   - Therefore, Rayna has \(90 + 60 = 150\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money they have together:**
   - Aurelia has $120.
   - Kassidy has $90.
   - Rayna has $150.
   - Total money = \(120 + 90 + 150 = 360\) dollars.

4. **Determine how much each person would have if they shared the total amount equally:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days in the Month**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of these days over the first 24 days:
- **First 8 Days**: All good.
- **Next 8 Days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 Days**: All neutral.

Now, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, the total number of good days after these three days is:
- Initial good days: 12
- Additional good days: 2 (from the next three days)

Thus, the total number of good days is:
\[ 12 + 2 = 14 \]

Since the month has 30 days, and we have already accounted for 27 days (24 initial days + 3 additional days), we need to determine how many good days are left in the remaining 3 days of the month.

The remaining 3 days are:
- 1 good day (from the next three days)
- 1 neutral day (from the next three days)
- 1 good day (from the next three days)

So, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 14 - 2 = 12 \]

However, since the question asks for the number of good days left in the month after the next three days, the correct answer is:
\[ 14 - 2 = 12 \]

But, since the next three days are already included, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 14 - 2 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 12 \]

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books, so:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

4. When James returns, he finds that there are twice as many dogs as when he left. So, the number of dogs is now 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy 12 more toys to have one for each of the 24 dogs, making the total number of toys 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs. The number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

   - Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720.

3. **Frances's Investment:**
   - Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount.
   - Frances's investment = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \).

4. **Remaining Amount after Frances's Investment:**
   - Remaining amount = Remaining amount after Dylan's investment - Frances's investment.
   - Remaining amount = 720 - 480 = 240.

5. **Skyler's Investment:**
   - Skyler's investment is the remaining amount after Dylan's and Frances's investments.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over a period of ten years (120 months).

1. **Calculate Rong's total savings:**
   - Rong saves 20 coins every month.
   - Over 120 months, Rong's total savings are:
     \[
     20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
     \]

2. **Calculate Neil's monthly savings:**
   - Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month.
   - 2/5 times more means Neil saves:
     \[
     20 \text{ coins} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins} \right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month}
     \]

3. **Calculate Neil's total savings:**
   - Neil saves 28 coins every month.
   - Over 120 months, Neil's total savings are:
     \[
     28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}
     \]

4. **Calculate the combined total savings:**
   - The total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil is:
     \[
     2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the total bill as \( T \). The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill:
\[ \text{Heartworm check} = 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1.0 \) dollar.
   - The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is \( 5 \times 1.0 = 5.0 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is \( 12 \times 0.5 = 6.0 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \( 3 \times 1.0 = 3.0 \) dollars.
   - The crate contains 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is \( 7 \times 3.0 = 21.0 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost of the crate:**
   - Sum the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = \( 5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0 \) dollars.

The price for such a crate of fruit is \( 32.0 \) dollars.

"To find the total number of squares on Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The problem states there are 14 red squares.
   - Number of red squares = 14

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The problem states there are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The problem states there are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**

"First, let's calculate the points each student has collected:

1. **Adam's Points**: Adam has 50 points.
2. **Betty's Points**: Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
   - 30% of 50 points is \( 0.30 \times 50 = 15 \) points.
   - Therefore, Betty has \( 50 + 15 = 65 \) points.
3. **Tom's Points**: Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   - Therefore, Tom has \( 65 - 30 = 35 \) points.
4. **Martha's Points**: Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   - Therefore, Martha has \( 3 \times 35 = 105 \) points.

Next, let's sum up the total points collected by the class:
- Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Martha's points
- Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person ate and then subtract that from the total number of slices available.

1. **Total number of slices per pizza**: 12 slices
2. **Number of pizzas**: 5 (one for each person)

First, calculate the total number of slices:
\[ 5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ slices} \right) = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Then, calculate the number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends who ate 3/4 of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times \left( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \text{ slices} \right) = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Now, add the slices eaten by all the friends:
\[ 24 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices available:
\[ 60 \text{ slices} - 42 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches, so 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
96 + 4 = 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) be the length of Bobby's shoe in inches. The equation based on the problem statement is:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is 10 inches.

"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars.

First, calculate the number of students' cars whose windows were smashed:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of these cars' windows.
- Number of students' cars with smashed windows = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \) cars.

Each student's car has 4 windows, so the total number of windows smashed in the students' cars is:
- \( 16 \times 4 = 64 \) windows.

Next, calculate the number of teachers' cars whose windows were smashed:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of these cars' windows.
- Number of teachers' cars with smashed windows = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \) cars.

Each teacher's car has 2 windows, so the total number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars is:
- \( 24 \times 2 = 48 \) windows.

Finally, add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students' windows) + 48 (teachers' windows) = 112 windows.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of votes for candidate A:**
   - Candidate A received 20% of the votes.
   - Total number of voters = 100.
   - Votes for candidate A = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

2. **Determine the number of votes for candidate B:**
   - Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A.
   - Votes for candidate B = 20 votes (A's votes) + 50% of 20 votes.
   - 50% of 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
   - Votes for candidate B = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. **Determine the number of votes for candidate C:**
   - The total number of votes is 100.
   - Votes for candidate C = Total votes - (Votes for A + Votes for B).
   - Votes for candidate C = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:
\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is also 33. This can be expressed as:
\[ F + A = 33 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS):** 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S):** Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   \[
   \text{Number of small shirts} = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]
3. **Medium (M):** Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   \[
   \text{Number of medium shirts} = 22 - 4 = 18
   \]
4. **Large (L):** Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   \[
   \text{Number of large shirts} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]
5. **Extra-large (XL):** Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   \[
   \text{Number of extra-large shirts} = 9 + 6 = 15
   \]

Now, we sum up all the shirts:
\[
\text{Total number of shirts} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since it needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we first need to calculate the temperature during the night.

1. The temperature during the day is 45 degrees.
2. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day.

\[ \text{Night temperature} = 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

3. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Therefore, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to at least 32 degrees.

\[ \text{Temperature increase needed} = 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

4. Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees:

\[ \text{Number of logs} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of groups formed.
2. Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of groups formed.**

The total number of people is 90, and each group consists of 9 people. Therefore, the total number of groups is:
\[ \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.**

According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups each had members bring back seashells. So, the number of groups that brought back seashells is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of employees after three months and then determine the total salary cost for all employees over that period.

1. **Initial number of employees**: 200
2. **Number of new employees hired each month**: 20
3. **Number of months**: 3

First, calculate the total number of new employees hired over three months:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Next, calculate the total number of employees after three months:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary cost for 260 employees is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Since we need the total amount paid over three months, we multiply the monthly cost by 3:
\[ 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3,120,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles currently has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

We know the total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total volume as:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( 2z \) for \( s \) in the equation:
\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, substitute \( z = 1 \) back into the equation for \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

The amount of oil is \( 2s \):
\[ 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is 4 ounces.

"To find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to calculate the total earnings based on the number of cycles, tasks per cycle, and the pay per task.

1. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - John does 30 cycles a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.

   Daily earnings = Number of cycles per day × Number of tasks per cycle × Pay per task
   Daily earnings = 30 cycles/day × 5 tasks/cycle × $1.20/task
   Daily earnings = 30 × 5 × 1.20
   Daily earnings = 150 × 1.20
   Daily earnings = $180

2. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - John works 7 days a week.

   Weekly earnings = Daily earnings × Number of days per week
   Weekly earnings = $180/day × 7 days/week
   Weekly earnings = $1260

Therefore, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week.

"To find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

Now, we add the points Sasha scored in both games:
- First game: 14 points
- Second game: 4 points

Total points scored by Sasha: \(14 + 4 = 18\)

"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we first need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food.

1. Calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
   - Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
   - Each package contains 11 tins.
   - Total tins of cat food = 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins.

2. Calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
   - Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
   - Each package contains 6 tins.
   - Total tins of dog food = 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins.

3. Find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food:
   - Difference = Total tins of cat food - Total tins of dog food
   - Difference = 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height each person can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working our way up to Naruto.

1. **Pompei's lifting height:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting height:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting height:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting height:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert Naruto's lifting height to feet:**

"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covered in each segment of his journey and then sum these distances.

1. First, we calculate the distance Mason traveled in the first 4 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, we sum the distances from both segments to find the total distance traveled:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) miles.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is \( 3 \times S \times 18 \) miles.
   - However, since they are traveling the same distance \( D \) together, we can say:
     \[
     3 \times S \times 18 = D
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     54S = D
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of four turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\text{speed of four turtles}} = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.

The cost of the new laptop is $600. With the trade-in, the cost is reduced by $200, making the new cost $400. Erika has received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, and she still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her savings, the money from her part-time job, and the money from her mom. This total amount, plus the additional $50 she needs, should equal the reduced price of the laptop:

\[ x + 150 + 80 + 50 = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + 280 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), subtract 280 from both sides:

\[ x = 400 - 280 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total milk production from the current cows:

- Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
- The farmer has 3 cows.

So, the current total milk production is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food baskets.

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - There is a $2 discount for each basket of red food, so each basket of red food effectively costs \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food baskets and the cost of the red food baskets.
   - Total cost = \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms that need to be cleaned:
   \[
   \text{Number of rooms to clean} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
   \]

2. Determine the total time required to clean these 45 rooms:
   \[
   \text{Total time in minutes} = 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. This is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and then double that amount. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Doubling this amount gives \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, we sum the number of homes built over the three years:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

"First, we calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, the total amount is:
\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, so we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total and subtract it from Rafaela's total:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amounts received by both Rafaela and Julieta to find the total:
\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela is:

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of each type of car and then subtract the total of the red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars in the rink.

1. **Red Cars**: The rink has 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. **Blue Cars**: The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

Next, we sum the number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[
12 + 10 + 30 = 52

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To determine how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit formula to find the cost of the chickens.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.**

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them:
\[
\text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

1. Calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
   - Joelle has 5 orchids.
   - Each orchid has 5 petals.
   - Total petals for orchids = 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

2. Calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies:
   - Joelle has 4 African daisies.
   - Each daisy has 10 petals.
   - Total petals for daisies = 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

3. Determine how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids:
   - Difference in petals = Total petals for daisies - Total petals for orchids
   - Difference in petals = 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of indoor plants:**
   - One-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants.
   \[
   \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining plants:**
   - Subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants.
   \[
   \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of outdoor plants:**
   - Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants.
   \[
   \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of flowering plants:**
   - The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants.
   \[
   \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of flowering plants:**
   - Divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
   \[
   \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden is 25%.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of a thingamabob first, and then use that to find the speed of a whirligig.

1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
2. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a thingamabob is:
   \[
   \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
3. A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:
   \[
   \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters per second} = 55 \text{ meters per second}
   \]

Thus, the speed of a whirligig is 55 meters per second.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

1. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

2. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

3. **Determine the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
   - Since \( J \) represents the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, and she was paid $6 for all her work, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem does not specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9J \times \text{payment per lawn} \).
   - Since \( J = 1 \) and the total payment is $6, the payment per lawn is \( \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3} \) dollars per lawn.
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $6.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $6 = $74.

Therefore, Tasha made $74 from lemonade sales.

"First, we determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since she bought 5 more notebooks to have a total of 7, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Original number of notebooks Martha had} + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for the original number of notebooks:

\[ \text{Original number of notebooks Martha had} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. Therefore, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after Calvin and his family have eaten dinner, and then how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftovers.

1. **Total Soup Capacity:**
   - The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

2. **Family Composition:**
   - Calvin (1 adult)
   - Calvin's wife (1 adult)
   - Two children (2 children)

3. **Dinner Consumption:**
   - Each adult eats 1 bowl.
   - Each child eats 1 bowl.
   - Total bowls consumed at dinner: 1 (Calvin) + 1 (wife) + 1 (child) + 1 (child) = 4 bowls.

4. **Determine Bowl Type:**
   - Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, and the family consumes 4 bowls in total, all 4 bowls consumed at dinner are adult bowls.

5. **Leftover Soup:**
   - The pot initially had enough for 4 adult bowls.
   - After dinner, 4 adult bowls are consumed, so there is no soup left in terms of adult bowls.

6. **Convert Adult Bowls to Child Bowls:**
   - 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls.
   - Therefore, 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 * 2 = 8 child bowls.

7. **Leftover Child Bowls:**
   - Since 4 adult bowls were consumed, and 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 8 child bowls, the total initial amount of soup in child bowls is 8.
   - The family consumed 2 child bowls (1 for each child) at dinner.
   - Leftover child bowls: 8 - 2 = 6 child bowls.

8. **Lunch for Children:**
   - Each child will have 1 bowl of soup for lunch.
   - Number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch: 6 child bowls / 2 children = 3 times.

Each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 3 times.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small and large masks separately.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

- The sloth has 8 hours available.

The number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total. If he makes 2 trips, the number of berries he needs to pick up per trip is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip to meet his goal is:

"First, we determine the amount of water Anthony and his father fill into the tank, which is half the amount of water in the pool. The pool contains 10,000 gallons, so the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we find the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days by subtracting the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday = 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday = 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Next, we sum these values to find the total number of Junebugs removed:
\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 \]

Calculating the sum:
\[ 39 + 78 = 117 \]
\[ 117 + 78 = 195 \]
\[ 195 + 48 = 243 \]
\[ 243 + 57 = 300 \]

The total number of Junebugs removed is 300.

Now, we divide the total by the number of days (5) to find the average:
\[ \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 60.

"To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

1. **Distance traveled by the bus:**
   - Speed of the bus: 60 miles per hour
   - Time traveled by the bus: 5 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the car:**
   - Speed of the car: 30 miles per hour
   - Time traveled by the car: 8 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

3. **Difference in distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car
   - Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - Maria has 4 friends, and she gives each friend 2 water balloons.
   - Total balloons given to friends: \(4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons}\).
   - Maria has 1 water balloon for herself.

   So, the total number of balloons at the start is:
   \[
   8 \text{ (friends' balloons)} + 1 \text{ (Maria's balloon)} = 9 \text{ balloons}
   \]

2. **Additional Balloons from Mom:**
   - Maria's mom gives each person (Maria and her 4 friends) 3 more balloons.
   - Total number of people: \(1 \text{ (Maria)} + 4 \text{ (friends)} = 5 \text{ people}\).
   - Total additional balloons: \(5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons}\).

3. **Total Balloons:**
   - Adding the initial balloons to the additional balloons:
   \[
   9 \text{ (initial balloons)} + 15 \text{ (additional balloons)} = 24 \text{ balloons}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls have is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people.
2. Add the number of boxes already owned by the charity group to the total number of donated boxes.
3. Determine the total number of tables required to fit all the boxes.
4. Subtract the number of tables the charity group already owns from the total number of tables required to find out how many new tables are needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people.
- Each person donates 5 boxes.
- There are 10 people.
- Total donated boxes = 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes.

Step 2: Add the number of boxes already owned by the charity group.
- The charity group already has 10 boxes.
- Total boxes = 50 boxes (donated) + 10 boxes (already owned) = 60 boxes.

Step 3: Determine the total number of tables required to fit all the boxes.
- Each table can fit 2 boxes.
- Total tables required = 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables.

Step 4: Subtract the number of tables the charity group already owns from the total number of tables required.
- The charity group already owns 15 tables.
- New tables needed = 30 tables (required) - 15 tables (owned) = 15 tables.

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the amount of hay needed for the goats:
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = 75 pounds.

2. Calculate the amount of hay needed for the sheep:
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds.
   - Each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.

3. Calculate the total amount of hay needed:
   - Total hay = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

Thus, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay.

"To determine how much money James was out, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount.
2. Apply the 40% discount to find the total cost after the discount.
3. Calculate the amount James recovers from selling 5 of the CDs.
4. Subtract the amount recovered from the total cost after the discount to find the net amount James was out.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount.
\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Step 2: Apply the 40% discount to find the total cost after the discount.
\[ 40\% \text{ off} = 0.40 \]
\[ \text{Discount amount} = \$150 \times 0.40 = \$60 \]
\[ \text{Total cost after discount} = \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

Step 3: Calculate the amount James recovers from selling 5 of the CDs.
\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Step 4: Subtract the amount recovered from the total cost after the discount to find the net amount James was out.
\[ \text{Net amount out} = \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that James actually made a profit of \$110. However, the question asks how much money he was out, which in this case is \$0 because he did not lose any money.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes for the initial swim:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time for the initial swim: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the initial swim time.
   - Rest time: \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - The total distance is 20 miles, and he has already swum 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - Half of 2 miles per hour is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time for the remaining swim:**
   - Time for the remaining swim: \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time for initial swim + Rest time + Time for remaining swim
   - Total time: \( 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \) hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the equations for \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time she woke up earlier:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

4. **Total sleep time on her bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.
   - Subtract the time spent sleepwalking: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.
   - Subtract the time she woke up earlier: 457 - 5 = 452 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Kim slept on her bed that day is 452 minutes.

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan originally has. 

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, we need to account for the 6 measuring spoons that Jonathan gifts to Pedro:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils remaining by adding the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups:

\[ \text{Total utensils remaining} = 24 \text{ (measuring cups)} + 10 \text{ (remaining measuring spoons)} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we add the number of patients admitted to the initial number of occupied beds to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

"To determine how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Emails Sent**: Robyn sends 16 emails a day.
2. **Work Emails**: 7 of these emails are work-related.
3. **Remaining Emails**: Subtract the work emails from the total emails to find the remaining emails.
   \[
   16 - 7 = 9 \text{ emails}
   \]
4. **Emails to Family**: Two-thirds of the remaining emails are sent to family.
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ emails}
   \]
5. **Other Emails**: Subtract the emails to family from the remaining emails to find the other emails.
   \[
   9 - 6 = 3 \text{ emails}
   \]
6. **Emails to Boyfriend**: One-third of the other emails are sent to her boyfriend.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \text{ email}

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number but overstated this by 20%, we can find the actual number of people by calculating what 100% (the actual number) would be. 

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people. Courtney's report of 48 people is 120% of the actual number, because she overstated by 20%.

So, we have:
\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of holes dug by the pirates over the four days and then find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   According to the problem, the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10.

   Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   The total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is 40, and the total number of holes by the end of the third day is 29. The number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
   \[
   40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}
   \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, substitute \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the third equation to find \( S \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then calculate the total time spent watching all episodes.

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, we calculate the total time spent watching all episodes:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Length of each episode} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:

- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Total distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Determine the total space required for each plant including the space between them:**
   - Each plant requires 1 foot of space for the plant itself and 1.5 feet of space between plants.
   - Total space per plant = 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - Number of plants that can fit = 111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4.
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Determine how many more plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants.
   - Number of additional plants needed = 44 - 17 = 27 plants.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
  \( 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \)

- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
  \( 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \)

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\( 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \)

The total amount of soil in the bag is 30 pounds. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total:
\( 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \)

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\( 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \)

"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount Jessica sets aside each month for shoes.
2. Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
3. Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the total amount set aside.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly amount set aside for shoes.
Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes.
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Step 2: Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Step 3: Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy.
Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so:
\[ \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To determine the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the process into two parts: peeling and sauteing.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sauteing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To saute 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \text{Time to saute} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the sum of the time to peel and the time to saute:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees
- Total warming: \( 4 \) degrees

The net temperature change is:
- \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages at which both Bill and his dad saw Comet Halley and then use this information to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - Therefore, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time, and the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years, we can find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - \(90 - 75 = 15\)

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the checks for each category and then sum them up.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes 1 check per month for the electric bill.
   - \(1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}\)

2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes 1 check per month for the gas bill.
   - \(1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}\)

3. **Church**: Buford writes 2 checks per month to the church.
   - \(2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}\)

4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes 1 check every quarter for the pest and lawn service.
   - \(1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}\)

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[ 12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks/year} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of trips the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips.

2. **Calculate the number of trips to Greece:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - Number of trips to Greece = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips.

3. **Calculate the number of trips to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - Number of remaining trips = \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.
   - Since these 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, the number of trips to France = \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) trips.

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.**
Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips.
\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.**
Janet works 40 hours a week.
\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment.**
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total spent so far:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

"To find out how long James spends reading, we first need to determine the rate at which he reads. James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, his reading rate is:

\[ \text{Reading rate} = \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ pages per minute} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to read 18 pages. Using the reading rate, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Number of pages}}{\text{Reading rate}} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{0.3 \text{ pages per minute}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To determine the number of guests currently at the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the changes in the number of guests step by step.

1. **Initial number of guests**: The hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkouts**: 24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

3. **Late checkouts**: 15 guests elected for a late checkout.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

4. **Afternoon check-ins**: Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests checked in}
   \]
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91 \text{ guests now}
   \]

5. **Evening check-ins**: 7 more people checked in after dinner was served.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then scale it up to 40 dwarves over 30 days.

1. **Determine the amount of ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day:**

"To determine how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family.
2. Divide this number by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

First, we calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family:
- Total seats in the Fine Arts Center: 6000
- Seats for graduates: 950
- Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats for friends and family = Total seats - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
Total seats for friends and family = 6000 - 950 - 300
Total seats for friends and family = 4750

Next, we divide the total seats for friends and family by the number of graduates:
Number of tickets per graduate = Total seats for friends and family / Number of graduates
Number of tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Number of tickets per graduate = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert all heights to the same unit. Let's use inches for consistency.

1. Convert Xavier's initial height from feet to inches:
   - 1 foot = 12 inches
   - Xavier's initial height: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

2. Add the growth to Xavier's initial height:
   - Xavier's new height: 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

3. Cole's initial height is already given in inches:
   - Cole's initial height: 50 inches

4. Add the growth to Cole's initial height:
   - Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

5. Calculate the difference between Cole and Xavier's new heights:
   - Difference: 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days worked.
2. Determine the fraction of a day worked each day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days worked.**
- The team worked for 3 weeks.
- Each week has 7 days.
- Total days = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

**Step 2: Determine the fraction of a day worked each day.**
- The team worked 3/8 of a day each day.

**Step 3: Convert the fraction of a day to hours.**
- There are 24 hours in a day.
- Hours worked each day = (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

**Step 4: Calculate the total hours worked by the team.**
- Total hours worked by the team = 21 days * 9 hours/day = 189 hours.

**Step 5: Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter.**
- Number of painters = 4.
- Hours worked by each painter = 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for the price of the car after \( t \) years is:
\[ P(t) = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]
where:
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \),
- \( t = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P(3) \approx 9860.78 \]

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

4. **Verify the total number of slices available:**
   - Each pizza has 8 slices.
   - There are 4 pizzas.
   - Total slices available = \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Since the total slices eaten (31) is less than the total slices available (32), the solution is valid.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each spent, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, therefore, took:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Thus, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

2. Calculate the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
3. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
4. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the trucks that did not have mechanical failures.

Step 1: Total number of trucks dispatched
- Mr Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks.

Step 2: Number of trucks with mechanical failures
- A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures.
- Number of trucks with mechanical failures = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) trucks.

Step 3: Number of trucks that successfully delivered
- Number of trucks that successfully delivered = Total trucks - Trucks with mechanical failures
- Number of trucks that successfully delivered = 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Step 4: Total amount of fertiliser delivered
- Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.
- Total amount of fertiliser delivered = Number of trucks that successfully delivered \(\times\) Tons of fertiliser per truck
- Total amount of fertiliser delivered = 15 \(\times\) 20 = 300 tons.

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week.
2. Determine the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys.
3. Subtract the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find the daily consumption of the third monkey.

First, we know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we calculate the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Now, we find the total daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day.
- The second monkey eats 14 bananas per day.
- Together, they eat \(10 + 14 = 24\) bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315, we can find the total daily consumption of all three monkeys:
- Total daily consumption = \( \frac{315 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \).

Finally, we subtract the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find the daily consumption of the third monkey:
- Daily consumption of the third monkey = \(45 - 24 = 21\) bananas per day.

Thus, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when the fourth train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - First train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Departs 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for a total of 145 minutes for his train.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved.

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach 200 toothpicks:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to save 80 more toothpicks is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for her retirement, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save and how much she can save each year.

1. **Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Current annual salary = $100,000.
   - Annual retirement income needed = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.

2. **Calculate the total amount needed for 20 years of retirement:**
   - Total retirement savings needed = Annual retirement income needed * Number of years in retirement.
   - Total retirement savings needed = $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

3. **Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   - Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

4. **Determine the number of years needed to save the total amount:**
   - Number of years needed = Total retirement savings needed / Annual savings.
   - Number of years needed = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school as \( P \).

Given:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = P - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will walk in 7 days as follows:

\[ \text{Total distance Sofie walks} = 10 \, \text{miles/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 70 \, \text{miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many miles Brian will walk:

\[ \text{Distance Sofie walks} = 2 \times \text{Distance Brian walks} \]

Substituting the distance Sofie walks:

\[ 70 \, \text{miles} = 2 \times \text{Distance Brian walks} \]

Solving for the distance Brian walks:

\[ \text{Distance Brian walks} = \frac{70 \, \text{miles}}{2} = 35 \, \text{miles} \]

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in one 10-hour shift.
2. Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in one 10-hour shift.
3. Use the information that 20 toys are still needed to find out how many toys the fifth worker produced in the 10-hour shift.
4. Calculate the hourly production rate of the fifth worker.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in one 10-hour shift:

- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each:
  \[
  2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys}
  \]

- Two workers produce 4 toys per hour each:
  \[
  2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys}
  \]

- Total toys produced by the first 4 workers:
  \[
  120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
  \]

Next, we know that the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in the 10-hour shift is:
\[
400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys}
\]

Now, we can find out how many toys the fifth worker produced in the 10-hour shift:
\[
380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys}
\]

Finally, to find the hourly production rate of the fifth worker:
\[
\frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}
\]

Thus, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs, we first need to calculate the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory’s dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. The remaining stickers Luis had are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Luis gave these remaining stickers to Kris, so Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
6. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).

Since Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{S}{4} = 16 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 16 \times 4 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of eggs each person painted and then find the difference between the number of eggs Camden and Arnold painted.

1. Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as \( A \).
2. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
3. Let the number of eggs Sarah painted be \( S \).
4. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
5. According to the problem, Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs:
   \[
   S + (S + 12) = 30

"To solve the problem, let's first determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the current number of marbles:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from his current number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T_2 \)-degree water.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixed water is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in the number of cows and chickens over the 21 days (3 weeks) and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Cows added per day**: 20
3. **Number of days**: 21

   Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

   Total cows after 21 days = Initial cows + Cows added
   Total cows after 21 days = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

4. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
5. **Chickens added per day**: 10
6. **Number of days**: 21

   Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

   Total chickens after 21 days = Initial chickens + Chickens added
   Total chickens after 21 days = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

7. **Total number of animals on the farm after 21 days**:
   Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens
   Total animals = 470 + 230 = 700

"To find the cost per bagel after the discount, we first calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the discount applied, and then divide that total by the number of bagels.

1. Calculate the total cost without the discount:
   \[
   4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00
   \]

2. Apply the 10% discount:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost with discount} = \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of bagels:
   \[
   4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

4. Calculate the cost per bagel:
   \[
   \text{Cost per bagel} = \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00
   \]

Thus, the cost per bagel after the discount is applied is \$1.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps and use the information given to find the number of potatoes Gomer ate.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the number of potatoes needed for a certain number of scoops:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes.
   - \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.

   So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - We know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.
   - To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
     \]
   - Cross-multiplying gives:
     \[
     3 \times 18 = 2 \times x
     \]
     \[
     54 = 2x
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{54}{2} = 27

"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes during each period and then convert that total into dozens.

1. Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
   \[
   5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. Add the eggs from both periods to get the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
   \[
   90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens (1 dozen = 12 eggs):
   \[
   \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any women alight.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. This means that the total ratio parts are 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

Each part of the ratio represents:
\[ \frac{84}{14} = 6 \text{ passengers} \]

Therefore, the number of men on the bus is:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ men} \]

And the number of women on the bus is:
\[ 9 \times 6 = 54 \text{ women} \]

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We need to find the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree first.
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (as given)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we can find the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree:
- 8-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Next, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \), the length of the red rope as \( R \), and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( R = 4B \) (The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope)
2. \( B = Y - 7 \) (The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)
3. \( R + B + Y = 37 \) (The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters)

First, substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first and third equations:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]
\[ R + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the second equation:
\[ R + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ R + 2Y - 7 = 37 \]
\[ R + 2Y = 44 \]

Now substitute \( R = 4(Y - 7) \) into \( R + 2Y = 44 \):
\[ 4(Y - 7) + 2Y = 44 \]
\[ 4Y - 28 + 2Y = 44 \]
\[ 6Y - 28 = 44 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ B = 12 - 7 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Finally, we can find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B \]
\[ R = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Amount Left in Ronnie's Money:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to their little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount left in Ronnie's money is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

The final amount left in Ronnie's money is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of each color of paint used in the mural. We know the following:

1. The mural used 12 pints of paint in total.
2. Half of the mural is yellow.
3. The remaining half of the mural is divided equally among red, white, and purple.

First, calculate the amount of yellow paint:
- Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is:
  \[
  \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
  \]

Next, calculate the amount of paint used for the other colors (red, white, and purple):
- The remaining half of the mural is 12 - 6 = 6 pints.
- This 6 pints is divided equally among red, white, and purple.

Since the remaining 6 pints are divided equally among the three colors:
- The amount of red paint is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
  \]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
2 \text{ pints}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dishwasher pods are in the special size box and then calculate how many cycles can be run for $1.

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Calculate how many pods can be bought for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods that can be bought for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with 10 pods:**
   - Since 1 pod is used per cycle, 10 pods can run 10 cycles.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 is 10.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing 10 Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the remaining money.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, expand the first equation:
\[
W = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour and then calculate how long it will take him to reach 60 snowballs.

1. **Determine the net number of snowballs made per hour:**
   - Jay makes 20 snowballs in an hour.
   - In one hour, there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes each.
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so in one hour, \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs melt.
   - Therefore, the net number of snowballs made in one hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs.

2. **Calculate the time required to make 60 snowballs:**
   - If Jay makes 12 snowballs per hour, we need to find out how many hours it will take to make 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to track the number of bandages used and ordered over the three days and determine the initial number of bandages.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change in bandages: \( -38 + 50 = 12 \)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \( 38 - 10 = 28 \)
   - Bandages ordered: 0
   - Net change in bandages: \( -28 \)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs (100 bandages)
   - Net change in bandages: \( -25 + 100 = 75 \)

Now, let's calculate the total net change in bandages over the three days:
- First day: \( +12 \)
- Second day: \( -28 \)
- Third day: \( +75 \)

Total net change: \( 12 - 28 + 75 = 59 \)

Given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Initial bandages} + \text{Total net change} = 78 \]
\[ \text{Initial bandages} + 59 = 78 \]

Solving for the initial bandages:
\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 78 - 59 = 19 \]

Thus, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant at different times of the day and then sum these numbers.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. This means \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people entered.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (in the morning) entered the restaurant. This means \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people entered.

Now, we sum all these numbers to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

\[ 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320 \]

Thus, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pens Alain's mom bought, considering both the red and black pens.

1. First, determine the number of red pens:
   - Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
   - Each pack contains 5 pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of red pens is \( 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \).

2. Next, determine the number of black pens:
   - Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens.
   - Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) packs of black pens.
   - Each pack contains 5 pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of black pens is \( 10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens} \).

3. Finally, calculate the total number of pens:
   - Total pens = number of red pens + number of black pens
   - Total pens = 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\text{Total cost of scotch}}{\text{Number of bottles}} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we calculate the number of bottles of cognac John buys:
\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times \text{Number of bottles of scotch} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, we find the cost per bottle of cognac, which is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = \text{Number of bottles of cognac} \times \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find the total amount John spends on everything:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of scotch} + \text{Total cost of cognac} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we first need to calculate how many pounds of ground beef are required to make 80 meatballs.

Given that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the number of pounds needed as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total number of meatballs}}{\text{Number of meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is:
\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Thus, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
Let \( b \ \) represent the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we know:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats.
   \[
   \text{Total treats} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Now, substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[
4c = 12
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):
\[
c = 3
\]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The cost of a basic manicure is $35, and the cost of a basic pedicure is $40. The total cost without the discount is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

With a 20% discount, the discount amount is:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the discounted price for both services is:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which totals 10 nails. The cost per nail is $3, so the total cost for nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Adding the cost of the nail art to the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure gives:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total amount Karen would pay is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Phineas Frog to travel half the distance on land and half the distance in water.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
3. **Distance in Water**: 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

Next, we calculate the time it takes to travel each segment:

- **Time on Land**: 
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time in Water**: 
  \[
  \text{Time in Water} = \frac{\text{Distance in Water}}{\text{Speed in Water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times together to get the total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Land} + \text{Time in Water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower.
2. Determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower, which is 50% more than the number of seeds in a small sunflower.
3. Add the number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers to find the total number of seeds.

Step 1: Calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower.
- A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds.
- 1 dozen = 12 seeds.
- Therefore, 3 dozen seeds = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

Step 2: Determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. Let's break down the information given:

1. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
2. Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 2 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
4. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.

First, we calculate Aaron's speed:
- Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know the following:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the following equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

To eliminate \( c \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.
