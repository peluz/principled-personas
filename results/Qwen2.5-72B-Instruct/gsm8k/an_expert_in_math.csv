"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to consider both the blue and white fibers.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as many bolts of white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the number of bolts of white fiber is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

3. To find the total number of bolts, we add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber:
   \[
   2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
   \]

Thus, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is:
\[
3

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's find the new value of the house. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original value + 150% increase).

The original value of the house is $80,000. Therefore, the new value is:
\[ 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the house, which includes the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Thus, Josh's profit is:
\[ 70,000 \]"
"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Determine the number of meters James runs in one session:
   - James runs 3 sprints each session.
   - Each sprint is 60 meters.
   - Therefore, in one session, he runs \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) meters.

2. Determine the number of sessions James runs in a week:
   - James runs 3 times a week.

3. Calculate the total meters run in a week:
   - Total meters per week = meters per session \(\times\) number of sessions per week
   - Total meters per week = \( 180 \times 3 = 540 \) meters.

So, the total number of meters James runs a week is 540 meters.

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed the entire flock needs per day.
3. Determine how much feed has already been given in the morning and afternoon.
4. Subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily requirement to find out how much is needed for the final meal.

Step 1: Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

Step 2: Wendi has 20 chickens, so the total daily feed requirement for the flock is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Step 3: Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. The total amount of feed given so far is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Step 4: The amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first 8 glasses (since every second glass is discounted):
- The cost of the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th glasses: 4 glasses * $5 = $20
- The cost of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th glasses: 4 glasses * $3 = $12

So, the total cost for the first 8 glasses is:
\[ 20 + 12 = 32 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the next 8 glasses using the same pattern:
- The cost of the 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th glasses: 4 glasses * $5 = $20
- The cost of the 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th glasses: 4 glasses * $3 = $12

So, the total cost for the next 8 glasses is:
\[ 20 + 12 = 32 \]

Adding the costs for both sets of 8 glasses gives us the total cost for 16 glasses:
\[ 32 + 32 = 64 \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ 64 \]"
"Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as \( S \), in Charleston as \( C \), and in Toulouse as \( T \).

Given:
- Seattle has 20 sheep, so \( S = 20 \).
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so \( C = 4S \).
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so \( T = 2C \).

First, calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[ C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[ T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, add the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[ S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to consider the interruptions and restarts.

1. **Initial Download:**
   - Carla downloads at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.4 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - Time to download 80 GB: \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Windows Restart:**
   - The Windows restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarted Download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - Time to download the full 200 GB: \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time for initial 80 GB + Time for Windows restart + Time for full 200 GB download
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes

Thus, the total time it takes to download the file is 160 minutes.

"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels away from home. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how far he travels back home during the 4 hours. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After the half-hour, he drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances he traveled back home:

\[ \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:

\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay and her overtime pay.

1. **Regular Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - She works 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Cost of mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Cost of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we sum up the costs for all the pastries:
- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

Therefore, the total cost is $694.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Revenue from Lemons**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost for Watering and Feeding**: $3

**Net Annual Profit**:
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

**Total Profit After \( n \) Years**:
\[ \text{Total Profit} = \text{Net Annual Profit} \times n - \text{Initial Cost} \]
\[ \text{Total Profit} = 7.5n - 90 \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that the total profit is greater than or equal to zero:
\[ 7.5n - 90 \geq 0 \]
\[ 7.5n \geq 90 \]
\[ n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n \geq 12 \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

2. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

4. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the red house:**
   After selling at the red house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

5. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

6. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18

Thus, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we determine the number of students remaining after those who enrolled in contemporary dance are accounted for:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Then, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance. Since 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we find the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

Finally, we calculate the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance:

\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100\% = 60\% \]

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to complete the trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the time already spent hiking:**
   - Marissa took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
   - She took another hour to walk the next 2 miles.
   - Total time spent so far: \(1 + 1 = 2 \text{ hours}\)

3. **Calculate the remaining time to complete the trail:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time already spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining distance to be hiked:**
   - Total distance: 12 miles
   - Distance already hiked: \(4 + 2 = 6 \text{ miles}\)
   - Remaining distance: \(12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}\)

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we account for the spill. Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Now, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

When we mix the remaining 9 liters of orange drink with the 15 liters of pineapple drink, the total volume of the mixture is:
\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
Cynthia eats 1 serving per day, so in 60 days, she will consume:

The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = $66 \).

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = $99 \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let \( D \) be Darrell's age and \( A \) be Allen's age. According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be written as:

\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]

This implies:

\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

We are also given that the sum of their ages is 162:

\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the equation \( D + A = 162 \):

\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator:

\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]

\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by multiplying both sides by 11:

\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]

\[ 18A = 1782 \]

Now, divide both sides by 18:

\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]

\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

\[ 109 \]"
"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the guesses made by Gunter's friends.
2. Calculate the average of these guesses.

First, let's identify the guesses:
- The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
- The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 80 plus 20 is 100.

So, the guesses are:
- First friend: 80
- Second friend: 60
- Third friend: 100

Next, we calculate the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3}
\]

First, add the guesses:
\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]

Then, divide by the number of guesses (3):
\[
\frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"First, we need to determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in each 20-minute interval and then sum them up.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 

To find 25% more points:
- 25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.
- Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Now, we sum the points from both intervals:
- Total points = Points in the first 20 minutes + Points in the second 20 minutes
- Total points = 4 + 5 = 9

Thus, the total points Mike scored is 9.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to determine his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

1. **Total Distance**: John runs 60 miles a week.

2. **Total Time**:
   - On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
   - On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.
   - Total time for the other two days: \( 1.5 \times 2 = 3 \) hours.
   - Total time for the week: \( 3 + 3 = 6 \) hours.

3. **Average Speed**:
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Average speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - She spends one-third of the time running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - She spends two-thirds of the time walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running = running speed \(\times\) time running
   - Distance running = \( 6 \) miles per hour \(\times\) 2 hours = 12 miles

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking = walking speed \(\times\) time walking
   - Distance walking = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour \(\times\) 4 hours = 6 miles

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = distance running + distance walking
   - Total distance = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

"First, we need to determine the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips. Since there are 5 servings in the bag and each serving has 250 calories, the total number of calories in the bag is:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target of 2000 calories. You have already consumed 1800 calories, so the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. Since the entire 300g bag has 1250 calories, the number of calories per gram is:

\[ \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \]

To find out how many grams of chips you can eat to consume 200 calories, we use the following calculation:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.17 \text{ calories/gram}} \approx 47.96 \text{ grams} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips.

"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it notes in the purse**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it notes used at work**: She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.
3. **Post-it notes remaining**: After placing the Post-it notes on the cups, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes Candice had before using them is the sum of the initial Post-it notes and the Post-it notes in the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

The number of Post-it notes used is 220, and the number of Post-it notes remaining is 23. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is:

"First, we need to determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. The cost of each blue tie is $40, so the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of cost per blue tie
Cost per red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Number of Rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. First, we calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]
   Then, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]

4. **Total Number of Pets:**
   To find the total number of pets, we sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
   \[
   60 + 120 + 168 = 348
   \]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[
348

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

The total number of students is 200. Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Next, we find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

We are told that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Thus, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda’s last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - The volume of the tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce because they lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, the initial volume of tomatoes is \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) ounces.

2. **Determine the number of cans of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - The number of cans used is \( \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \) cans.

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - The total number of tomatoes used is \( 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \) tomatoes.

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (the cars that took the exit).

The total number of cars initially is 30, so the equation is:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]

Subtract 25 from both sides:
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"First, let's determine the total number of potted plants Mary has initially. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which gives:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, she received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. This means she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   20 + \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 20\right) = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}
   \]

Now, we sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is:

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the total time based on the rate at which the fog bank moves.

1. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes.
2. The city is 42 miles across.

First, we find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

Next, we calculate the total time to cover 14 segments, knowing that each segment takes 10 minutes:
\[ 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first determine the inner dimensions of one box and then calculate the volume.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume of one box = inner length × inner width × inner height
   - Inner volume of one box = \( 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = inner volume of one box × number of boxes
   - Total inner volume = \( 24 \times 3 = 72 \) cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the total time he spent watching TV from Monday to Friday and then isolate the time spent on Wednesday.

1. **Monday and Tuesday:**
   - Each night, he watched a 1-hour episode.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Wednesday:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes he watched.
   - Total time on Wednesday: \(0.5x \text{ hours}\).

3. **Thursday:**
   - He watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Friday:**
   - He watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\).

5. **Total time spent watching TV:**
   - Sum of all the days: \(2 \text{ hours} + 0.5x \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours}\).

Now, we can set up the equation and solve for \(x\):
\[
2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7
\]
\[
5.5 + 0.5x = 7
\]
Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
\[
0.5x = 1.5
\]
Divide both sides by 0.5:
\[
x = 3

Thus, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, Henry intended to bake twice as many cookies as last year, which would be \( 2x \).

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 110 cookies. Therefore, before dropping the cookies, he had \( 110 + 5 = 115 \) cookies.

So, we have the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 115 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 115 \]
\[ 2x = 115 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 100 \]
\[ x = \frac{100}{2} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

First, let's find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = \frac{\text{Number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold}}{6} \]

Substituting the given value:

\[ \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Let \( d \) represent the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 300 = 50d \]

To find \( d \), we solve for \( d \):

"First, let's determine Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ 40000 = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Solving for Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we calculate Lylah's salary four years later. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add the two new salaries to find the total salary the two were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

\[ 99076.92 \]"

"First, let's identify the items and their costs:
- Milk: $2 (food)
- Eggs: $3 (food)
- Light bulbs: $3 (nonfood)
- Cups: $3 (nonfood)
- Roach traps: $4 (nonfood)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total cost of food items = $2 + $3 = $5

Now, we calculate the total cost of the nonfood items:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total cost of nonfood items = $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%:
Tax on nonfood items = 10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the nonfood items:
Total cost of nonfood items including tax = $10 + $1 = $11

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for all the apes combined:

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Adding these together gives the total monthly requirement:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we multiply the monthly requirement by 2:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- The football field is 100 yards long.
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Each back-and-forth run is 200 yards (100 yards each way).

\[ \text{Distance Blake runs} = 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth from the 40-yard line, which means she runs 40 yards to the end of the field and 40 yards back.
- Each back-and-forth run is 80 yards (40 yards each way).
- Kelly does this 34 times.

\[ \text{Distance Kelly runs} = 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances they ran:

\[ \text{Difference} = 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

The winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial price and the increase interval:**
   - Initial price: $20
   - Increase interval: every 2 months
   - Increase rate: 20% of the original price

2. **Calculate the number of increases over 36 months:**
   - 36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases

3. **Determine the multiplier for each increase:**
   - Each increase is 20% of the original price, so the multiplier for each increase is 1 + 0.20 = 1.20

4. **Calculate the final price after 18 increases:**
   - The final price can be calculated using the formula for compound interest: \( P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \)
   - Where \( P_0 \) is the initial price, \( r \) is the rate of increase, and \( n \) is the number of increases
   - Plugging in the values: \( P = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \)

5. **Compute the final price:**
   - \( P = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \)
   - \( (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376 \)
   - \( P \approx 20 \times 38.3376 = 766.752 \)

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $766.75.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 8 \) back into the equation \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage. Let's break down the information given:

1. **Rats:**
   - Rats are kept in 3 cages.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Since each cage has one hamster, the total number of hamsters is 10.

3. **Rabbits:**
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total straw:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.

We can set up the equation for the total straw distributed:

\[
\text{Total straw} = (\text{straw for rats}) + (\text{straw for hamsters}) + (\text{straw for rabbits})
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
160 = (3 \times r \times 6) + (10 \times 5) + 20
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
160 = 18r + 50 + 20
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
160 = 18r + 70
\]

Subtract 70 from both sides:

\[
90 = 18r
\]

Divide both sides by 18:

\[
r = \frac{90}{18} = 5
\]

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is:

\[

"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n periods, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the principal amount)
- \( r = 0.02 \) (the monthly interest rate)
- \( n = 1 \) (since interest is compounded monthly)
- \( t = 3 \) (the time in months)

Since the interest is compounded monthly, we can simplify the formula to:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]

First, calculate \( 1 + 0.02 \):

\[ 1 + 0.02 = 1.02 \]

Next, raise 1.02 to the power of 3:

\[ 1.02^3 = 1.061208 \]

Now, multiply this by the principal amount:

\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict is:

\[ 106.12 \]

"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost price per bag is $20, and the transportation cost per bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The total profit made by the trader is $400. Therefore, the number of bags sold can be calculated by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

Thus, the trader sold 50 bags.

"First, let's calculate the total amount spent on food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the rides. They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33:
\[ \text{Cost of rides} = 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[ \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost of tickets} + \text{Cost of food} + \text{Cost of rides} \]
\[ \text{Total expenses} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each person pays:
\[ \text{Amount per person} = \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

Thus, each of them paid:

"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks.
2. Divide the weekly total by 7 to find the daily amount.

First, we calculate the total weekly requirement for ten ducks:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement:
\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net number of trees added each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.

**Step 1: Calculate the net number of trees added each year.**

Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. Therefore, the net number of trees added each year is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.**

Tom starts with 50 trees. Over 10 years, he adds 8 trees each year. The total number of trees added over 10 years is:
\[ 8 \times 10 = 80 \]

So, the total number of trees after 10 years is:
\[ 50 + 80 = 130 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.**

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \]

**Step 4: Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.**

The number of trees left after 30% die is:
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \]

Thus, the number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now in total, we need to follow the sequence of her card collection over the three months.

1. Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times the initial number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). Therefore, in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, we add up all the cards she has collected over the three months and the initial number of cards:
- Initial cards: 20
- First month: 60
- Second month: 40
- Third month: 200

Total number of cards: \(20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320\)

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers.

1. Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.
2. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns \(500 \times 5 = 2500\) cents from Publisher A.
3. Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays \(5 \times 2 = 10\) cents per sentence.
4. For 500 sentences, Mark earns \(500 \times 10 = 5000\) cents from Publisher B.
5. Adding the earnings from both publishers, Mark makes \(2500 + 5000 = 7500\) cents in a week.

"To determine how much money John made in the year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increased salary due to the 5% raise.

1. **Calculate the one-time monetary reward:**
   - John receives a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

2. **Calculate John's original annual salary:**
   - John makes $2000 per week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Original annual salary = $2000 * 52 = $104,000.

3. **Calculate the new weekly salary after the 5% raise:**
   - 5% raise on $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100.
   - New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100.

4. **Calculate the new annual salary:**
   - New annual salary = $2100 * 52 = $109,200.

5. **Calculate the total money made in the year:**
   - Total money made = One-time monetary reward + New annual salary

   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Breakfast (omelets):**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices.
   - Total cheese slices for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Dinner (macaroni and cheese):**

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each cup. Let's break down the information given:

1. Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.
2. First, calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of half a dozen plates} = 6 \times 6000 = 36000
   \]
3. According to the problem, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this amount:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of twenty dozen cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800
   \]
4. Next, we need to find the cost of one dozen cups. Since twenty dozen cups cost $34800:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one dozen cups} = \frac{34800}{20} = 1740
   \]
5. Finally, to find the cost of each cup, we divide the cost of one dozen cups by 12:

1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given:
- Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

First, let's express the amount of water in each pool 4 minutes ago:
- 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has \( 8 \) gallons of water now.

"First, let's determine the total number of Pokemon cards James has initially:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- James buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, we calculate the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

New total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage is 33%.

"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike still has:
- Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
- He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
- Therefore, he still has \(5 - 2 = 3\) pen pals.

Next, we calculate the number of letters Mike receives each week:
- Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
- Therefore, he receives \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages Mike receives each week is:
- \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages each week.

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing 30 pages is:

"First, we need to determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

30% of 30 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \] times.

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.

\[ 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"First, we need to determine the total number of cows in the stalls before Mr. Sylas buys more cows. There are 10 stalls, each with 20 cows:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. The number of new cows per stall is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Now, we add the new cows to the original number of cows in each stall:
\[ 20 \text{ original cows per stall} + 2 \text{ new cows per stall} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:
\[ 22 \text{ cows per stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[ 176 \]"
"To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill and then sum them up.

1. **Pennies**: 100 pennies = 100 * $0.01 = $1.00
2. **Nickels**: 40 nickels = 40 * $0.05 = $2.00
3. **Dimes**: 20 dimes = 20 * $0.10 = $2.00
4. **Dollar bills**: 40 dollar bills = 40 * $1.00 = $40.00

Now, we add up all the values:
$1.00 (pennies) + $2.00 (nickels) + $2.00 (dimes) + $40.00 (dollar bills) = $45.00

So, the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank is:

"To find the weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the number of 10-foot sections in the tree is:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

The total weight of the tree is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, so the weight of the wood eaten is:

\[ 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate 30% of its wood is:

\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \)
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
4. Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_a = 52 \)

First, we use the information that Andrea has 52 apples to find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we use the number of apples Jamal has to find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we use the number of bananas Jamal has to find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies today:
   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can set up a proportion to find out how much flour is needed for 36 cookies.
   - \(\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}\)
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 6 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. Calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies tomorrow:
   - Similarly, we set up a proportion for 30 cookies.
   - \(\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}}\)
   - Solving for \(y\):
     \[
     y = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 5 \text{ cups}
     \]

3. Add the amounts of flour needed for both days:
   - Total flour needed = 6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"First, let's determine how much money each person has:

- Carmen has $100.
- Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has \(100 + 25 = 125\) dollars.
- Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has \(125 + 50 = 175\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the amounts of money each girl has:

- Total amount = Carmen's money + Samantha's money + Daisy's money
- Total amount = \(100 + 125 + 175\)

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500
   \]

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount he paid.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 3\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = \$12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fees:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fees} = 5\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = \$20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total fees:**
   \[
   \text{Total fees} = \text{Transfer fees} + \text{Brokerage fees} = \$12,000 + \$20,000 = \$32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = \text{Remaining loan amount} + \text{Total fees} = \$250,000 + \$32,000 = \$282,000

"First, we need to determine the time it takes for the oil to heat up from 300 degrees to 400 degrees. It takes 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time to heat up from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the time it took to heat up to 300 degrees and the time to heat up to 400 degrees:
\[ 20 + 28 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

The cooking time is 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil:
\[ 48 - 5 = 43 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the warming time and the cooking time:
\[ 48 + 43 = 91 \text{ minutes} \]

"To find the total number of windows in both houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Windows in the bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 6 \text{ windows/house} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional windows in each house:**
   - Each house has 4 additional windows.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in both houses is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows/house} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total number of windows:**
   - Adding the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows gives us \(12 \text{ windows} + 8 \text{ windows} = 20 \text{ windows}\).

"First, we determine the number of cards with the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the 80 cards have the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards have the letter A. 

Next, we find out how many cards are left after the A cards are accounted for:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we determine how many of the remaining 48 cards have the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards have the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

So, 24 cards have the letter B. 

Next, we find out how many cards are left after the B cards are accounted for:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Then, we determine how many of the remaining 24 cards have the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards have the letter C, we calculate:

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

First, we know that each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we subtract the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long. To find the number of sterling silver beads that fit into the remaining 17 inches, we divide the length by the size of each bead:
\[ 17 \text{ inches} \div 0.25 \text{ inches/bead} = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Katerina uses \(\boxed{68}\) sterling silver beads per necklace."
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. In the second week, they each doubled their number of stories.

- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stories each wrote over the two weeks:

- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories

Adding these together gives the total number of stories written by all three:

\(60 + 120 + 180 = 360\)

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has initially.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so:
5 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 125 cents

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so:
2 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 20 cents

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and the dimes to find the total amount of money Kelly has:
125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

So, the amount of money Kelly will have left is:

"First, we determine the number of medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, we can write:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = \text{Ali's medals} - 5 \]

Given that Ali has 22 medals:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals} = \text{Ali's medals} + \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals} \]

Substituting the total medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

Thus, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Points After 3 Rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he does not get an extra point: \(18\) points.
   - Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike: 22 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 43 points

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week and then calculate how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight given her rate.

1. First, find out how much weight Joey loses in one week:
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in one week, Joey loses:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. Next, determine how much weight Sandy needs to lose to match Joey's 8 pounds:
   Sandy needs to lose 8 pounds.

3. Sandy takes 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy loses:
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds} \text{ in } 4 \text{ weeks}
   \]
   Therefore, Sandy's rate of weight loss is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

4. Now, calculate how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds at her rate of 0.5 pounds per week:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60,000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60,000 \times 2 = 120,000\).

Thus, the current population of Chile is:

To find out how many marbles his father gave him:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, let's add all the marbles together:
\[ 20 \text{ (bought from Johanna)} + 50 \text{ (already in the store)} + 8 \text{ (from his father)} = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

The total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool and then multiply it by the cost per cubic foot.

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   - The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep.
   - Volume = length × width × depth
   - Volume = 6 ft × 4 ft × 5 ft
   - Volume = 120 cubic feet

2. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool:**
   - The cost is $0.1 per cubic foot.
   - Total cost = Volume × Cost per cubic foot
   - Total cost = 120 cubic feet × $0.1 per cubic foot
   - Total cost = $12

The cost to fill the pool is $12.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of girls and nongendered children in the classroom, and then sum all the children.

1. **Number of boys**: Given as 30.
2. **Number of girls**: The problem states there are 3 times as many girls as boys. Therefore, the number of girls is:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]
3. **Number of nongendered children**: The problem states there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

Now, we sum the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children in the classroom:
\[
30 + 90 + 3 = 123

"The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. If the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \( x \) be the number of electric poles. Then:

\[
\frac{x}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

So, the total number of electric poles required is:

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of people at the beginning of the party.
2. Calculate the number of people who left after an hour.
3. Determine the number of men and women who left.
4. Calculate the number of women who stayed at the party.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of people at the beginning of the party.**

The total number of people is the sum of the men and women:
\[ 25 \text{ men} + 15 \text{ women} = 40 \text{ people} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of people who left after an hour.**

One-fourth of the total number of people left:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ people} \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of men and women who left.**

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Therefore, the number of men who left is:
\[ 25 \text{ men} - 22 \text{ men} = 3 \text{ men} \]

Since 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is:
\[ 10 \text{ people} - 3 \text{ men} = 7 \text{ women} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of women who stayed at the party.**

The number of women who stayed is the initial number of women minus the number of women who left:
\[ 15 \text{ women} - 7 \text{ women} = 8 \text{ women} \]

Thus, the number of women left at the party is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"

"First, we need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

where \( x \) is the number of pencils in each box. Solving for \( x \):

\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils, so the total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. We can do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added liquid (cream).

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need to calculate the number of ice cubes required:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening Effect of Added Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

   \]

3. **Determine the monthly salary of a senior programmer:**
   - The monthly salary of a junior programmer is $2000.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Monthly salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
   \]

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers:**
   - The number of junior programmers is 40.
   - The monthly salary of each junior programmer is $2000.
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we first need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge required to reach 100%.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so the remaining charge needed is:
\[ 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to charge 40 percentage-points, the time required is:
\[ 40 \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To determine which job provides Nick with a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs after accounting for taxes and other deductions.

### Job A:
- **Hourly wage**: $15
- **Annual hours**: 2000
- **Gross annual income**: \( 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \) dollars
- **State tax rate**: 20%

**Net annual income for Job A**:
\[ \text{Net income} = \text{Gross income} - (\text{Gross income} \times \text{Tax rate}) \]
\[ \text{Net income} = 30,000 - (30,000 \times 0.20) \]
\[ \text{Net income} = 30,000 - 6,000 \]
\[ \text{Net income} = 24,000 \] dollars

### Job B:
- **Annual salary**: $42,000
- **Property tax**: $6,000
- **State tax rate**: 10% on net income after property tax

**Net annual income for Job B**:
1. Subtract the property tax from the gross income:
\[ \text{Net income after property tax} = 42,000 - 6,000 \]
\[ \text{Net income after property tax} = 36,000 \] dollars

2. Calculate the state tax on the net income after property tax:
\[ \text{State tax} = 36,000 \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{State tax} = 3,600 \] dollars

- Earnings per silo: $220

\[
\text{Daily earnings from silos} = 5 \times 220 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the difference in daily earnings.**

\[
\text{Difference in daily earnings} = 1100 - 1000 = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase.**

\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference in daily earnings}}{\text{Original daily earnings}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
\]

Thus, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

1. **Calculate the monthly cost of food:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Monthly cost of food = $25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month.

2. **Monthly cost of treats:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.

3. **Monthly cost of medicine:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.

4. **Total monthly cost:**

"First, let's determine the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time for boating and swimming is:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the time he spent watching shows. He watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, so the total time for watching shows is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

According to the problem, the time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time he spent on vacation. Then:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]
\[ 15 = 0.30T \]
To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

The problem states that he spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:

"To find out how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Marisa receives in 5 days.
2. Calculate the total amount of money Marisa spends on lollipops in 5 days.
3. Subtract the total amount spent on lollipops from the total amount received to find the amount saved.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Marisa receives in 5 days.
Marisa receives $5 each day. Over 5 days, she receives:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ dollars/day} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Marisa spends on lollipops in 5 days.
Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day. The cost per day is:
\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 1 \text{ dollar/day} \]
Over 5 days, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ dollar/day} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Subtract the total amount spent on lollipops from the total amount received to find the amount saved.
\[ 25 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days is:

"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost for the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since this amount represents half of his change, the total change he received after buying the candy is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy he bought is:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is:
\[ 4 \]"
"Let's denote the age of Carver's son as \( x \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance the train travels in one complete trip and then calculate how many days it can operate before reaching the 18,000-mile service interval.

1. **Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:**
   - The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is:
     \[
     75 \text{ miles} + 100 \text{ miles} = 175 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than this combined distance:
     \[
     175 \text{ miles} - 50 \text{ miles} = 125 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:**
   - The total distance for one complete trip (first city to second city, second city to third city, and third city back to the first city) is:
     \[
     75 \text{ miles} + 100 \text{ miles} + 125 \text{ miles} = 300 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:**
   - The train makes this trip 3 times a day:
     \[
     300 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips/day} = 900 \text{ miles/day}
     \]

4. **Determine how many days the train can operate before reaching 18,000 miles:**
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days it can operate before reaching this distance, we divide the total service interval by the daily distance:
     \[
     \frac{18,000 \text{ miles}}{900 \text{ miles/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
     \]

Thus, the train goes between services every 20 days.

"To determine how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to find out how much stuffing is required for a collie bed. 

A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The amount of stuffing for a collie bed is the average of these two amounts:

\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total amount of interest she will pay over the five months and then add this to the principal amount to find the total amount to be repaid. Finally, we divide this total by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest rate is 10% per year. For five months, the interest rate is:
   \[
   \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\%}{12} \times 5 = \frac{10}{12} \times 5 = \frac{50}{12} \approx 4.17\%

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.
3. Calculate the total profit by subtracting the cost of supplies from the total revenue.
4. Determine the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade.
5. Calculate the profit per hour.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade.**

Millie can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups.
\[
3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.**

Millie sells each cup for $1.
\[
36 \text{ cups} \times 1 \text{ dollar per cup} = 36 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total profit.**

The cost of supplies is $18.
\[
36 \text{ dollars (revenue)} - 18 \text{ dollars (cost)} = 18 \text{ dollars (profit)}
\]

**Step 4: Determine the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade.**

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour.
\[
\frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the profit per hour.**

\[
\frac{18 \text{ dollars (profit)}}{9 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Thus, Millie's profit per hour is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.

He sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.

According to the problem, the amount of land he has left is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 12.8 \times 5 \):

\[
12.8 \times 5 = 64
\]

Next, divide 64 by 2:

\[
64 \div 2 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"First, we determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = 0.5 \times 52 = 26
\]
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 0.5 \times 52 = 26
\]

The performance is with only the female members, so initially, there are 26 girls performing. However, half of these girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who can make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have in terms of the ratio given. Let the number of popsicles Betty has be \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has be \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common factor.

The total number of popsicles they have together is given as 165. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 5x + 6x = 165 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 11x = 165 \]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ x = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Thus, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

     \]

3. **Total cost of all streaming services:**
   - Adding the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
     \[
     10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Savings by cancelling the cable package:**
   - The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.
   - The total cost of the streaming services is $26 per month.
   - The savings is:
     \[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog.

1. First, we need to find the number of candles that are expected to explode. Since Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, the probability of a candle exploding is:
   \[
   1 - 0.99 = 0.01
   \]
   Therefore, the number of candles that are expected to explode out of 50,000 is:
   \[
   50000 \times 0.01 = 500
   \]

2. Next, we need to find the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles have this defect. So, the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog is:
   \[
   500 \times 0.05 = 25
   \]

Thus, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[
25

"Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Apples gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples
   - From the average trees: Let this be \( x \) apples

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples
   - From the average trees: 0 apples

3. **Total apples gathered by both:**
   - Joanne: \( 30 + 15 + x \)
   - Sister: \( 60 + 45 + 0 \)

4. **Combined total:**
   \[
   (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500
   \]
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 500 - 150
   \]
   \[
   x = 350
   \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads (each animal has one head):
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps, dromedaries have 1 hump):
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

Thus, the number of dromedaries is:
\[
\boxed{56}

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by both the homemade and store-bought bird feeders.

1. **Number of homemade bird feeders**: 3
2. **Number of store-bought bird feeders**: 3
3. **Birds attracted by each store-bought feeder**: 20
4. **Birds attracted by each homemade feeder**: 20 + 10 = 30

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ homemade feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ store-bought feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Finally, we add the number of birds attracted by both types of feeders to get the total number of birds:

"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}C \) cards.

Each card is sold for $1.5, so the total amount he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}C \).

Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so he earns a total of $150 from selling the cards.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}C = 150 \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}C = 1.5 \times \frac{2C}{3} = 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3} \times C = 1 \times C = C \]

So, we have:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - Total hotdogs prepared: \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - Total hotdogs needed: \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short: \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Each guest needs 2 hotdogs, so the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Thus, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

"First, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]

"First, we calculate the temperature increase due to Marcus baking. He bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the temperature increases by 5 degrees.

Temperature increase from baking = 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After baking, the temperature is:

Initial temperature + Temperature increase from baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Next, we calculate the temperature decrease when Marcus opens the window. The window is open for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes.

Temperature decrease from opening the window = (30 minutes / 10 minutes) * 2 degrees = 3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Finally, we find the final temperature of the house by subtracting the temperature decrease from the temperature after baking:

Final temperature = Temperature after baking - Temperature decrease from opening the window = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

"First, let's calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, so James's swim time is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, so James's bike time is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time it took James to complete the run. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 121 + x \text{ minutes} \]

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 121 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to complete the run.

Final answer:
\[ 59 \]"

"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the department store.
4. Calculate the total revenue.
5. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per sneaker.**

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. The cost per sneaker is:
\[
\text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.**

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each at the flash sale. The total revenue from the flash sale is:
\[
\text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from the department store.**

The remaining sneakers are:
\[
48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers}
\]
The salesman sold these 31 sneakers for $25 each to the department store. The total revenue from the department store is:
\[
\text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of the super ticket:**
   - Movie super ticket: $20
   - One popcorn and one soda for $1 extra: $1
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost without the super ticket:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Soda: $3
   - Let the regular price of popcorn be \( P \)
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + $3 + \( P \) = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.
   - So, $15 + \( P \) = $21 - $2
   - Simplifying, $15 + \( P \) = $19

4. **Solving for \( P \):**
   - \( P = $19 - $15 \)
   - \( P = $4 \)

The regular price of popcorn is $4.

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed:
\[ V = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. Finally, we will divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight of all feed = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) = 4500 pounds.

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips required, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer at home. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4} T = 20
\]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
T = 20 \times 4
\]
\[
T = 80
\]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is \( 80 \).

"To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day to break in his new shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason has to break in the shoes.
2. Divide the total minutes required by the number of days he can walk.

First, we know that Jason has 3 weeks to break in the shoes. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days in 3 weeks is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

However, Jason can only walk 4 days a week. Therefore, the total number of days he can walk in 3 weeks is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes Jason needs to walk each day. The total time required to break in the shoes is 240 minutes. So, we divide the total minutes by the number of days he can walk:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Thus, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day.

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

1. **Number of kids allergic to dairy (A)**: 9
2. **Number of kids allergic to peanuts (B)**: 6
3. **Number of kids allergic to both (A ∩ B)**: 3

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

The total number of kids in the class is 32. Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Thus, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( n \) be the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25n \)

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the total costs are equal:

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Lily as \( L \), and by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (total insects collected)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( D = 9 \) back into the equations to find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to determine the quantities based on the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( x \) be the number of onions Sophia bought.
Let \( y \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

According to the problem:
\[ 4x = 12 \]
\[ 4y = 4 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these quantities together:

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th.
2. Determine the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
3. Divide the total number of calories by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days.**

- From December 31st to January 1st: 1 day
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July 1st to July 19th: 19 days

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

**Step 2: Determine the total number of calories to burn.**

Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. To lose 30 pounds:

Total calories = 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit.**

Daily calorie deficit = Total calories / Total days
Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 201 days ≈ 522.39 calories/day

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of:

522 calories/day

"Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \) and the number of sofas Ophelia has as \( S_O \). According to the problem, Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).

Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can write:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so the number of chairs Jenna has \( C_J \) is:
\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so the number of sofas Jenna has \( S_J \) is:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

1. **Determine the number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Set up the savings for each half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half.
   - He saves twice as much each day in the second half, so he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for each half:**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125
   \]

6. **Combine like terms:**
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

8. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
   \]

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."
"First, we calculate the total cost of the apples, oranges, and peaches.

"Let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \). According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"First, we calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Cost of notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50
- Cost of pens: 2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50
- Cost of calculator: 1 calculator * $12/calculator = $12.00
- Cost of geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10.00/geometry set = $10.00

Next, we add up these amounts to get the total cost before the discount:
Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
Discount amount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

"First, we need to determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, when the water is warm, he swims a mile in:
\[ 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we need to convert the total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Finally, we add the pages read in both weeks:

3. In 7 years, his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).
4. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew: \( S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \).

We can substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct setting for 520 degrees.

1. **Determine the percentage error:**
   - The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it reaches 468 degrees.
   - The difference is \( 468 - 450 = 18 \) degrees.
   - The percentage error is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Percentage error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
     \]

2. **Apply the percentage error to the new temperature:**
   - The recipe calls for 520 degrees.
   - We need to find the setting \( x \) such that when the oven is set to \( x \), it actually reaches 520 degrees.
   - The relationship is:
     \[
     x + 0.04x = 520
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     1.04x = 520
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Adding the durations of the two movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Number of hours: 2

First, calculate the total number of cups sold in the next two hours:
\[
10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, calculate the total earnings from these 20 cups:
\[
20 \text{ cups} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Total Earnings
Finally, add the earnings from both parts to find the total amount of money Patrick earned:
\[
30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is:

"To determine how many years it will take before Jeremy's tires need to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires can handle before needing replacement.
3. Calculate the number of months the tires will last.
4. Convert the number of months into years.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per month.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, the number of rotations per mile is:
\[ \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

For 400 miles:
\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations the tires can handle.**

Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of months the tires will last.**

To find out how many months the tires will last, divide the total number of rotations the tires can handle by the number of rotations per month:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

**Step 4: Convert the number of months into years.**

There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washings with 1 pump per wash:**
   - The bottle provides 120 washings with 2 pumps per wash.
   - If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of washings will be:
     \[
     120 \text{ washings} \times 2 = 240 \text{ washings}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost per washing:**
   - The total cost of the bottle is $24.00.
   - The cost per washing is:
     \[
     \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ washings}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per washing}
     \]

3. **Convert the cost per washing to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, the cost per washing in cents is:
     \[
     0.10 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 10 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, the cost per pump of shampoo is \(\boxed{10}\) cents."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is:
\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount to the total cost. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

So, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and ensure it does not exceed $10.

1. **Total Cost of Classes**: $60
2. **Total Number of Classes**: 10

First, calculate the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes:
\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Total Number of Classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6
\]

Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny's parents will sign him up again if he attends all 10 classes.

Next, we need to determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10. Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class if Manny misses \( x \) classes is:
\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

Solve for \( x \):
\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]
\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]
\[
10x \leq 40
\]
\[
x \leq 4
\]

Thus, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Therefore, the number of classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again is:
\[
\boxed{4}

   - Therefore, Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.

2. **Determine how many miles Lynn ran:**
   - Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.
   - Let \( L \) represent the number of miles Lynn ran.
   - According to the problem, \( 20 = L + 3 \).

3. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: \( L = 20 - 3 \).
   - Therefore, \( L = 17 \).

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]

   - For 16 muffins: \( 3 \text{ tablespoons/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 48 \text{ tablespoons} \).

3. **Calculate the total amount of salt:**
   - Each muffin requires 0.25 tablespoons of salt.
   - For 16 muffins: \( 0.25 \text{ tablespoons/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 4 \text{ tablespoons} \).

4. **Sum the amounts of all dry ingredients:**
   - Total flour: 80 tablespoons
   - Total sugar: 48 tablespoons
   - Total salt: 4 tablespoons
   - Total dry ingredients: \( 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 \text{ tablespoons} \).

Thus, the total number of tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana needs to make 16 muffins is:

"To find out how much candy each of them would have if they pool and share their candy equally, we first need to calculate the total amount of candy they have together. 

Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. 

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of people (3) to find out how much each person gets:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ pounds}}{3} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.

"To find out how much change Adam got, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought and then subtract this from the $15 he paid.

First, calculate the cost of the candies of type A:
\[ 7 \text{ candies} \times \$0.5 \text{ per candy} = \$3.5 \]

Next, calculate the cost of the candies of type B:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.75 \text{ per candy} = \$7.5 \]

Now, add the costs of both types of candies to find the total cost:
\[ \$3.5 + \$7.5 = \$11 \]

Finally, subtract the total cost from the amount Adam paid to find the change:
\[ \$15 - \$11 = \$4 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of good days left in the month after the next three days.

1. **Initial Distribution of Days:**
   - Good days: 12
   - Bad days: 8
   - Neutral days: 30 - 12 - 8 = 10

2. **Next Three Days:**
   - The next three days are: good, neutral, and good.

3. **Update the Count of Good Days:**
   - Initially, there are 12 good days.
   - After the next three days, two more good days are added.
   - Total good days: 12 + 2 = 14

4. **Total Days in the Month:**
   - The month has 30 days.
   - After the next three days, the total number of days recorded is 30 + 3 = 33.

5. **Days Left in the Month:**
   - Since the month has 30 days, the next three days are part of the 30 days.
   - Therefore, the number of days left in the month is 30 - 30 = 0.

6. **Good Days Left in the Month:**
   - Since the month is complete, the number of good days left in the month is 0.

However, the question asks for the number of good days left in the month after the next three days, which means we need to consider the good days within the 30-day period.

- The good days within the 30 days are: 12 (initial) + 2 (next three days) = 14.

Since the month is complete, the number of good days left in the month is 14.

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books, so:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the current height of the bamboo is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the additional height the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow an additional 360 inches, we divide the additional height by the growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Thus, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 8 more toys to have one toy for each of the 12 dogs.
4. When James returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left. So, there are 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.
5. James buys 12 more toys to have one toy for each of the 24 dogs.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so there are 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James no longer needs 3 toys, so he has 24 - 3 = 21 toys.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys James needs:

- Initially, he had 4 toys.
- He bought 8 toys for the 12 dogs.
- He bought 12 more toys for the 24 dogs.
- He no longer needs 3 toys because 3 dogs are gone.

Total toys = 4 (initial) + 8 (first purchase) + 12 (second purchase) - 3 (no longer needed) = 21

So, the total number of toys James needs is 21.

"To determine how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps of the investments made by Dylan and Frances, and then find the remaining amount for Skyler.

1. **Dylan's Investment:**
   - Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount.
   - Total amount = $1200.
   - Dylan's investment = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2400}{5} = 480 \).

2. **Remaining Amount after Dylan's Investment:**
   - Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment.
   - Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720.

3. **Frances's Investment:**
   - Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount.
   - Remaining amount = 720.
   - Frances's investment = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{1440}{3} = 480 \).

4. **Remaining Amount after Frances's Investment:**
   - Remaining amount = Remaining amount after Dylan's investment - Frances's investment.
   - Remaining amount = 720 - 480 = 240.

5. **Skyler's Investment:**
   - Skyler's investment is the remaining amount after Dylan's and Frances's investments.
   - Skyler's investment = 240.

Thus, Skyler's investment is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To determine how many more signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures, we first need to find out how many signatures they currently have together.

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. Adding these together gives:
\[ 20 + 44 = 64 \]

The sisters' goal is to have 100 signatures in total. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the number of signatures they currently have from their goal:
\[ 100 - 64 = 36 \]

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

"First, we determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how much Karen earns in one day. She works 3 hours per day, so her daily earnings are:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Finally, we calculate how much Karen earns in two days:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Karen earns \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in two days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

First, we find the number of hash browns made per potato:
\[ \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Next, we use this ratio to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:
\[ \text{Hash browns from 96 potatoes} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

Therefore, the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes is:

"To determine by how much the group exceeds the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of the group and then compare it to the maximum load.

1. Calculate the total weight of the 8 other adults:
   \[
   8 \text{ adults} \times 80 \text{ kg/adult} = 640 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. Add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 other adults. Assuming Jack's weight is also 80 kg:
   \[
   640 \text{ kg} + 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg}

"Let's denote the number of cookies each person has with the following variables:
- \( K \) for Katarina
- \( M \) for Max
- \( C \) for Cookie Monster
- \( S \) for Summer

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: \( K = M - 5 \)
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: \( M = C + 12 \)
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: \( S = M + 23 \)
4. Katarina has 68 cookies: \( K = 68 \)

First, we use the information that Katarina has 68 cookies to find the number of cookies Max has:
\[ K = M - 5 \]
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Next, we use the number of cookies Max has to find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has:
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Then, we use the number of cookies Max has to find the number of cookies Summer has:
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now, we sum the number of cookies each person has:
\[ K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]
\[ K + M + C + S = 298 \]

Thus, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[ 298 \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length of the dress before adding the lace trim is \( L + 0.5L = 1.5L \).

She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length of the dress \( 1.5L + 20 \) cm.

We know the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

\[
\boxed{80}

1. **Turtle Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - Therefore, to mow half of the lawn, it would take him \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes.

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, to mow half of the lawn, it would take him \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to mow the lawn by mowing half in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode is \( 30 + 20 = 50 \) minutes.

"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have already spent walking and subtract that from the total time they have available.

1. Total time available to walk to school: 30 minutes
2. Time taken to get to the corner where the library is: 6 minutes
3. Time taken to get to the fire station from the library: 13 minutes

First, we add the time taken to get to the library and the time taken to get to the fire station:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we subtract the total time spent walking so far from the total time available:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

Thus, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"First, we need to determine the cost of each candy. We know the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost of the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost gives us the cost of the four candies:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives us the total cost:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved after ten years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of coins Rong saves per month.
2. Calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month.
3. Determine the total number of months in ten years.
4. Calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of coins Rong saves per month.**
Rong saves 20 coins every month.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month.**
Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong. Therefore, the additional number of coins Neil saves per month is:
\[ 20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 8 \]
So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \] coins per month.

**Step 3: Determine the total number of months in ten years.**
There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \] months.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years.**
Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \] coins.
Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \] coins.
The combined total savings of Rong and Neil:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \] coins.

Thus, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

"First, let's determine the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the total bill as \( T \). The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill:
\[ \text{Heartworm check} = 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:

"To determine the total number of squares on Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The number of red squares is given as 14.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24.

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we first need to determine the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks.

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so:
   \[
   \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we know the combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let \( G \) represent the capacity of Gary's truck. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[
4000 + 4800 + G = 11600
\]

Solving for \( G \):
\[
8800 + G = 11600
\]
\[
G = 11600 - 8800
\]
\[
G = 2800
\]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the number of dumplings eaten by both the males and the females.

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings. There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[
6 \times 3 = 18
\]

Next, we know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:
\[
3 + 1 = 4 \text{ dumplings}
\]

There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[
8 \times 4 = 32
\]

To find the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we add the number of dumplings eaten by the females and the males:
\[
18 + 32 = 50
\]

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate how many scoops Erin can buy without the deal:
- Each scoop costs $1.50.
- With $6.00, Erin can buy \( \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \) scoops.

Now, let's apply the deal:
- For every 2 scoops bought, she gets 1 scoop free.
- With 4 scoops, she can get 2 free scoops (since 4 scoops / 2 = 2 free scoops).

So, the total number of scoops Erin can get is:
- 4 scoops bought + 2 free scoops = 6 scoops.

Therefore, Erin can buy 6 scoops of ice cream.

"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Dora's father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as:

\[ \text{Dora's mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of votes each candidate received and then find out how many votes candidate C received.

1. Calculate the number of votes candidate A received:
   - Candidate A got 20% of the votes.
   - Total number of voters = 100.
   - Votes for candidate A = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

2. Calculate the number of votes candidate B received:
   - Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A.
   - Votes for candidate B = 20 votes (A's votes) + 50% of 20 votes = 20 + 0.50 * 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. Calculate the number of votes candidate C received:
   - Total votes = 100.
   - Votes for candidate C = Total votes - (Votes for candidate A + Votes for candidate B) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Thus, candidate C received 50 votes.

"First, we determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we calculate:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck has 77 apples initially.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After giving away 10 apples, Boris has:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck, after receiving 10 apples, has:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. We subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the number of books each person has in terms of Steven's books.

Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.

According to the problem:
- Clara has two times as many books as Steven, so Clara has \( 2S \) books.
- Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has \( S + 6 \) books.

We are given that Clara has 20 books:
\[ 2S = 20 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, we know:
- Steven has 10 books.
- Alice has \( S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \) books.
- Clara has 20 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Thus, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

2. Number of students who like to bake: 10
3. Number of students who like to play basketball: 5
4. The rest of the students like to play video games or play music.
5. The number of students who like to play music is twice the number who prefer playing basketball.

First, calculate the number of students who like to play music:
\[ \text{Number of students who like to play music} = 2 \times \text{Number of students who like to play basketball} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the total number of students who have hobbies other than playing video games:
\[ \text{Total students with other hobbies} = \text{Number of students who like to bake} + \text{Number of students who like to play basketball} + \text{Number of students who like to play music} \]
\[ \text{Total students with other hobbies} = 10 + 5 + 10 = 25 \]

Now, subtract the number of students with other hobbies from the total number of students to find the number of students who like to play video games:
\[ \text{Number of students who like to play video games} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Total students with other hobbies} \]

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of students in each class. Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these students are girls. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times 0.40 = 16 \]

Since the total number of students in each class is 40, the number of boys in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Thus, the number of boys in each class is 24.

"To solve the problem, we need to follow the steps of Lorraine's trades and calculate the total number of buttons she ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trade 90% of small stickers for large buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons

3. **Remaining small stickers:**
   - 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers

4. **Trade 50% of large stickers for large buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons

5. **Remaining large stickers:**
   - 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers

6. **Trade the remaining large stickers for small buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons

7. **Total small buttons:**
   - Remaining small stickers: 3
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total small buttons = 3 + 60 = 63 small buttons

8. **Total large buttons:**
   - From trading small stickers: 9
   - From trading large stickers: 20
   - Total large buttons = 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons

9. **Convert large buttons to small buttons:**
   - Each large button is worth 3 small buttons, so 29 large buttons = 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons

10. **Total small buttons:**
    - From remaining small stickers: 3
    - From trading large stickers: 60
    - From converting large buttons: 87
    - Total small buttons = 3 + 60 + 87 = 150 small buttons

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 150.

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:
\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is also 33. This can be expressed as:
\[ F + A = 33 \]

We can substitute \( F = 2A \) into the equation \( F + A = 33 \):
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, we can find \( F \) by substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Thus, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"First, we determine how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, and Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Ahmed's books} = 300 \]

Solving for Ahmed's books:

\[ \text{Ahmed's books} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of books Ezra has read after reading 150 more books:

\[ \text{Ezra's total books} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we add the number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:

\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Ezra's total books} + \text{Ahmed's books} = 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Thus, the total number of books they have read altogether is:

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \).

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying 17 more fish, the total number of fish Bob has is:
\[ 3 + O \text{ (orange fish)} \]
\[ 4 + W \text{ (white fish)} \]

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O = 5 + 2W \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
\[ O + W = 17 \]

Substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into the equation \( O + W = 17 \):
\[ 5 + 2W + W = 17 \]
\[ 5 + 3W = 17 \]
\[ 3W = 12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their current hourly rates and then find the difference in their earnings for 20 hours of work.

1. **Billy's Initial and Current Hourly Rates:**
   - Billy's starting hourly rate: $10.00
   - After 2 months, Billy's raise: $0.50
     \[
     \text{New hourly rate} = 10.00 + 0.50 = 10.50
     \]
   - On his first anniversary, Billy's raise: $1.00
     \[
     \text{Current hourly rate} = 10.50 + 1.00 = 11.50
     \]

2. **Sally's Hourly Rate:**
   - Sally's starting hourly rate is $0.50 more than Billy's starting hourly rate.
     \[
     \text{Sally's hourly rate} = 10.00 + 0.50 = 10.50
     \]

3. **Earnings for 20 Hours:**
   - Billy's earnings for 20 hours:
     \[
     \text{Billy's earnings} = 11.50 \times 20 = 230.00
     \]
   - Sally's earnings for 20 hours:
     \[
     \text{Sally's earnings} = 10.50 \times 20 = 210.00
     \]

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks. She plays for half an hour every day, so for 14 days, the total hours are:
\[ 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours she plays in the following week. She plays for 2 hours every day, so for 7 days, the total hours are:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played:
\[ 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the first car:**
   - The first car's speed is 60 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance traveled by the first car in 2 hours = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the second car:**
   - The second car's speed is 70 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance traveled by the second car in 2 hours = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Determine the separation between the two cars:**
   - The separation is the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars.
   - Separation = Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car
   - Separation = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Thus, the two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours.

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Use the height of the mosaic to find the length.

First, calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 72 \text{ chips per bag} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with 144 chips:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips per square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height:

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and the amount of money she will get refunded from Amazon.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total shipping cost:
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Milly initially paid $32 for the book.
   - She will receive a refund of $24.
   - She will also pay $3 for shipping.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = 32 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Milly will lose $11.

"To determine the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the installation costs based on the given information.

1. **Base Installation Cost:**
   The base installation cost is $129.00, which includes:
   - 4 mirrors
   - 2 shelves
   - 1 chandelier
   - 10 pictures

2. **Additional Items:**
   - Angela has 6 mirrors, but the base installation already includes 4 mirrors, so she needs 2 additional mirrors.
   - Angela has 2 chandeliers, but the base installation already includes 1 chandelier, so she needs 1 additional chandelier.
   - Angela has 20 pictures, but the base installation already includes 10 pictures, so she needs 10 additional pictures.

3. **Cost for Additional Items:**
   Each additional item costs $15.00. Therefore, the total number of additional items is:
   - 2 additional mirrors
   - 1 additional chandelier
   - 10 additional pictures

   Total additional items = 2 + 1 + 10 = 13

   Cost for additional items = 13 * $15.00 = $195.00

4. **Total Cost:**
   Total cost = Base installation cost + Cost for additional items
   Total cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is $324.00.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the height Naruto can lift a mountain based on the given relationships and the height Pompei can lift a mountain.

1. **Pompei's lifting height:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.

2. **Saskay's lifting height:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting height:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting height:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, 480 inches = \( \frac{480}{12} \) feet = 40 feet.

Thus, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of his journey and then add them together.

1. First, we calculate the distance he travels in the first 4 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the distance he travels in the next 6 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, we add the two distances together to get the total distance:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then use that to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) (distance per hour).
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance, the total distance \( D \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times v \times 18
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Determine the total speed of 4 turtles:**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
     \]

4. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of 4 turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel the same distance.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after all contributions and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the reduced price of the laptop:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"First, we calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Since a large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces and Adam slices 3 large apples, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Next, we calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Since a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces and Adam slices 5 small apples, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to find the total number of slices:
15 slices from large apples + 15 slices from small apples = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 slices - 15 slices eaten = 15 slices

   \]

2. Determine the additional amount of milk needed to reach 25 liters per day:
   \[
   25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day}
   \]

3. Calculate how many more cows are needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk per day:
   \[
   \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows}

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of 8 glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:
\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number:
\[ \lceil 6.75 \rceil = 7 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day, starting with the initial 10 infected people.

**Day 0:**
- Initial number of infected people: 10

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total number of infected people: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total number of infected people: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total number of infected people: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Thus, the total number of people infected after three days is:

3430"
"First, we calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we multiply the number of customers by the amount each customer tipped:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips both Rafaela and Julieta received together, we add their individual totals:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela is:

1520"

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many badges each person earns in a year and then find the difference between the number of badges Wendy earns and the number of badges Amber earns.

1. **Claire's badge earning rate:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges.

2. **Amber's badge earning rate:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Therefore, Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge per month.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's badge earning rate:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Therefore, Wendy earns \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \) badges per month.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges.

4. **Difference in badges earned by Wendy and Amber:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.
   - Amber earns 6 badges in a year.
   - The difference is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \) badges.

Thus, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"To determine how much Paige raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of slices from the loaves.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.**

Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The total number of hours is:
\[ 6:00 \, \text{PM} - 1:00 \, \text{PM} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.**

Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour. Over 5 hours, the total number of loaves baked is:
\[ 2 \, \text{loaves/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 10 \, \text{loaves} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices from the loaves.**

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \, \text{loaves} \times 8 \, \text{slices/loaf} = 80 \, \text{slices} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the slices.**

Each slice is sold for 50 cents. The total revenue from selling 80 slices is:
\[ 80 \, \text{slices} \times 0.50 \, \text{dollars/slice} = 40 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
3. Subtract the sum from the total number of burritos ordered.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students.
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- Total burritos given to students = 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

Step 2: Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.
- Total burritos consumed = 500 burritos (students) + 20 burritos (Mr. George) = 520 burritos

Step 3: Subtract the total burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered.
- Total burritos ordered = 600 burritos
- Total burritos leftover = 600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80.

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to determine the number of each type of car and then subtract the total from 75.

1. **Red cars**: There are 12 red cars.
2. **Green cars**: They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars.
   \[
   \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. **Blue cars**: They have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

Now, we sum the number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[
\text{Total number of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52
\]

The rink has 75 cars in total. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from 75:
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 = 23
\]

Thus, the number of yellow cars is:

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly has in her cart:

1. The total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, so the cost of one pack of bacon is:
   \[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

2. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet of chicken} \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so:

\]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[
\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[
\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
\]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the total number of plants:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of flowering plants is:

"To find the speed at which a whirligig spins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of a thingamabob.
2. Use the speed of a thingamabob to find the speed of a whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11:

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

Thus, the speed of a whirligig is:

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we can start by calculating the cost of the yogurt and then use the total cost to find the cost of the carrots.

1. The cost of the salad is $6.
2. The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily food, so the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
5. Since she eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

1. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

2. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

3. **Determine the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
   - Since \( J \) is the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, and she earned $6 in total, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since $6 is the total payment for all the times she mowed Joe's lawn).

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - If \( J = 1 \), then Tasha mowed Joe's lawn 1 time, Kamala's lawn 3 times, and Alba's lawn 5 times.
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 \) times.
   - Since Joe paid $6 for 1 time, the rate per mowing is $6.
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

"First, we need to determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha bought 5 more notebooks to have a total of 7, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Martha's original notebooks} + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for Martha's original number of notebooks:

\[ \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's number of notebooks from Martha's:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bowls of soup the pot can provide.
2. Determine the number of bowls of soup consumed by the adults and children during dinner.
3. Calculate the number of leftover bowls of soup.
4. Determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Total Soup Capacity:**
   - The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

2. **Dinner Consumption:**
   - Calvin (1 adult bowl)
   - Calvin's wife (1 adult bowl)
   - Two children (2 child bowls)
   - Total bowls consumed during dinner:
     \[
     1 \text{ (Calvin)} + 1 \text{ (wife)} + 2 \text{ (children)} = 4 \text{ bowls}
     \]

3. **Leftover Soup:**
   - The pot can fill 8 child bowls in total.
   - Dinner consumption is equivalent to 4 child bowls (since 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls):
     \[
     4 \text{ adult bowls} \times 2 = 8 \text{ child bowls}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total consumption in child bowls is:
     \[
     2 \text{ (Calvin)} + 2 \text{ (wife)} + 2 \text{ (children)} = 6 \text{ child bowls}
     \]
   - Leftover soup in child bowls:
     \[
     8 \text{ (total)} - 6 \text{ (consumed)} = 2 \text{ child bowls}
     \]

4. **Lunch for Children:**
   - Each child can have 1 bowl of soup for lunch.
   - Number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ leftover bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 1 \text{ time}
     \]

Thus, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 1 time.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we need to calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Finally, we sum the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

Thus, the total amount of material Jo needs is 16 yards.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( D = 60 \)
2. Duncan's age eight years ago was \( D - 8 \)
3. Adam's age four years ago was \( A - 4 \)

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]

Add 4 to both sides:
\[ A = 30 \]

Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:

"First, we determine the amount of water Anthony and his father fill into the tank. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which is:

\[ \frac{10000 \text{ gallons}}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we find the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days by subtracting the amount used from the initial amount:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his total expenses for the month and see how much money he has left.

1. **Calculate the cost of the movies he has already seen:**
   - 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars
   - 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars

2. **Calculate the cost of the popcorn and candy he has already bought:**
   - 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
   - 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars

3. **Total expenses so far:**
   \[
   50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining budget:**
   \[
   150 - 130 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost of the movie, popcorn, and candy for the last day of the month:**
   - Movie ticket on a Friday: \(10\) dollars
   - Popcorn: \(8\) dollars
   - Box of candy: \(2\) dollars
   \[
   10 + 8 + 2 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Check if he can afford the last movie, popcorn, and candy:**
   \[
   20 - 20 = 0 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Since he has exactly 20 dollars left, he can afford one more movie, one popcorn, and one box of candy.

Therefore, the number of additional movies Colby can see is:

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Calories in a mini cinnamon roll:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
   - Calories in a mini cinnamon roll = \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.

2. **Total calories in 200 mini cinnamon rolls:**
   - Total calories = 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories/mini cinnamon roll = 40,000 calories.

3. **Calories in a mini blueberry muffin:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
   - Calories in a mini blueberry muffin = \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.

4. **Total calories in 300 mini blueberry muffins:**
   - Total calories = 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories/mini blueberry muffin = 45,000 calories.

5. **Total calories in all the pastries:**
   - Total calories = 40,000 calories (mini cinnamon rolls) + 45,000 calories (mini blueberry muffins) = 85,000 calories.

The total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday.
2. Divide the total by the number of days (5) to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed each day:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: \( 2 \times 39 = 78 \) Junebugs
- Wednesday: \( 2 \times 39 = 78 \) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, sum these values to get the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed is 300.

Next, we divide the total by the number of days (5) to find the average:

"To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the total distance each vehicle traveled.

1. Calculate the distance the bus traveled:
   - The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance (bus) = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

2. Calculate the distance the car traveled:
   - The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance (car) = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

3. Determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car:
   - Difference in distance = Distance (bus) - Distance (car)
   - Difference in distance = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and John as \( P \), \( A \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( P + A + J = 100 \) (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old)
2. \( A = J + 10 \) (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. \( P = A + J \) (Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, find \( A \) and \( P \):
\[ A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is:

"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The first 12 hours are covered by the 1000 pesos charge. The additional 5 hours (17 - 12) will be charged at 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

The total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had chosen the 24-hour stay, it would have cost him 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours is:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour stay + additional hours) = 250 pesos

"First, we determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, the amount of hay each sheep needs is:

\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
- John earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
  \[
  50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we need to account for his expenses:
- He spends 50 dollars on gas.
- He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank.
- He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost for the pencils is:
  \[
  5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time James spends swimming the initial distance:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Rest time = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = 3 hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) miles per hour = 1 mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 8 \) miles / \( 1 \) mile per hour = 8 hours.

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   - Total time = Initial swimming time + Rest time + Remaining swimming time
   - Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine the number of pages in the book, we start by understanding the given information:

1. The book is 1.5 inches thick.
2. There are 100 pages per inch of paper.

First, we calculate the total number of pages per inch:
\[ 100 \text{ pages/inch} \]

Next, we find the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ 100 \text{ pages/inch} \times 1.5 \text{ inches} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contains 2 pages. Therefore, the total number of sheets of paper is:
\[ \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages/sheet}} = 75 \text{ sheets} \]

However, the question asks for the total number of pages, which we have already calculated as 150 pages.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know that he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 measuring cups.

To find the number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has initially:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Number of measuring spoons} = 24 + 16 = 40 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we need to subtract these from the total number of utensils:
\[ \text{Remaining utensils} = 40 - 6 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds to the number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

"To determine how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total emails sent per day**: 16
2. **Work emails**: 7

First, we calculate the number of non-work emails:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we determine how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we find out how many emails are left after accounting for the family emails:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

One-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Thus, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:
\[ 1 \]

"First, we determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya and Aliya is 3 years old, we calculate:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

Next, we determine Shawna's father's age. Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we calculate:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number and overstated this by 20%, we can find the actual number of people by calculating what 100% (the actual number) would be.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people. Courtney's report is 120% of the actual number, which is 48. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the total number of holes on the island by the end of the fourth day.
3. Use the information that the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net number of holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

The total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

Next, let \( x \) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day. The total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 29 + x \]

According to the problem, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day. The number of holes dug by the end of the first day is 10, so:
\[ 29 + x = 4 \times 10 \]
\[ 29 + x = 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 40 - 29 \]
\[ x = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokemon:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

We can substitute \( X \) and \( S \) in the first equation using the second and third equations.

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]
Simplify:
\[
S = 160 - 13
\]
\[
S = 147
\]

Thus, Stan has caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokemon."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then calculate the total time spent watching all episodes.

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, we calculate the total time spent watching all episodes:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Length of each episode} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Total distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ \boxed{374} \]"

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these together:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39.

Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost of the books:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25 to buy the books. Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold each day and then multiply by the respective prices.

First, let's define the number of boxes sold on each day:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
- \( G_S = 10 \) (Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday)
- \( A_S = G_S - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \) (Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than gingerbread)
- \( G_U = G_S + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 \) (Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday than on Saturday)
- \( A_U = 15 \) (Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday)

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold over the two days:
- Total gingerbread sold: \( G_S + G_U = 10 + 15 = 25 \)
- Total apple pie sold: \( A_S + A_U = 6 + 15 = 21 \)

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from gingerbread: \( 25 \times 6 = 150 \)
- Earnings from apple pie: \( 21 \times 15 = 315 \)

Finally, we sum the earnings from both products:
- Total earnings: \( 150 + 315 = 465 \)

Thus, Sunny earned a total of \( 465 \) dollars over the two days.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother based on the information given.

1. **Emil's current age**: 19 years old.
2. **Emil's age when he turns 24**: 24 years old.

When Emil turns 24:
- He will be half the age of his dad.
- He will be twice as old as his brother.

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the current age of Emil's dad.
- \( B \) as the current age of Emil's brother.

### Step 1: Determine the age of Emil's dad when Emil turns 24
When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} \times (D + 5) \]
\[ 24 = \frac{D + 5}{2} \]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]

### Step 2: Determine the age of Emil's brother when Emil turns 24
When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2 \times (B + 5) \]
\[ 24 = 2B + 10 \]
Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 14 = 2B \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ B = 7 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the current ages of Emil's dad and brother
- Current age of Emil's dad: \( D = 43 \)
- Current age of Emil's brother: \( B = 7 \)

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   Each flower grows 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot.

2. **Determine the total space required for each plant including the space between them:**
   Each plant requires 1 foot of space for the plant itself and 1.5 feet of space between plants, totaling 2.5 feet per plant.

3. **Calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   The flower bed is 111 feet long. To find the number of plants that can fit, divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required per plant:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants}
   \]
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number:

"First, we calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds

The total amount of soil in the bag is 30 pounds. We subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To determine the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the problem into two parts: peeling the shrimp and sautéing them.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to sauté 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to sauté, the total time to sauté 90 shrimp is:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and sauté 90 shrimp is the sum of the time to peel and the time to sauté:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Air conditioner on low for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate on low: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \( 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees} \)

2. **Air conditioner on high for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate on high: 3 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \( 3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees} \)

3. **Air conditioner off for 2 hours:**
   - Warming rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total warming: \( 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees} \)

Now, we sum up the total temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \( 6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees} \)
- Total warming: \( 4 \text{ degrees} \)

Net temperature change:
- Net cooling: \( 18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees} \)

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages at which Bill and his dad saw Comet Halley.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet the second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - The time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time, and the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years, we can find Bill's age when he saw the comet the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Thus, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider each type of check and the frequency at which he writes them.

1. **Electric bill checks:**
   - Buford writes 1 check per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, he writes \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) checks for the electric bill per year.

2. **Gas bill checks:**
   - Buford writes 1 check per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, he writes \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) checks for the gas bill per year.

3. **Church checks:**
   - Buford writes 2 checks per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, he writes \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) checks to the church per year.

4. **Pest and lawn service checks:**
   - Buford writes 1 check per quarter.
   - There are 4 quarters in a year.
   - Therefore, he writes \( 1 \times 4 = 4 \) checks for the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is \(\boxed{52}\)."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \).

The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France and the number of flights to Germany are each \( \frac{1}{8}F \) (since \( 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} \) is split equally between France and Germany).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes is twice the number of flights the second plane makes:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can find the number of flights to France:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To determine the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - The combined duration of Tobias' and Chikote's howls is \( 20 + 40 = 60 \) seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous' howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - The total combined duration of the three wolves' howls is \( 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \) seconds.

5. **Convert the total duration to minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Therefore, \( 120 \) seconds is \( \frac{120}{60} = 2 \) minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

We are given that the total age of the children is 20:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( L \):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Therefore, Helene's age \( H \) is:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of cookies brought by the guests. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the size of each slice of watermelon relative to the total watermelon and then find the percentage for each adult's slice.

1. Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \).
2. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is:
- 4 kids' slices: \( 4x \)
- 2 adults' slices: \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \)

So, the total watermelon is divided into:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

   - Let \( y \) be the initial charge when Maria went to the park.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know this equals \( x \approx 0.348 \).
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589
   \]

Thus, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 58.9%.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment.
2. Calculate Janet's total earnings per hour.
3. Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.
4. Determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the required amount.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment.
- The cost of the car is $10,000.
- She wants to save 20% of this amount.
- 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.

Step 2: Calculate Janet's total earnings per hour.
- She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips.
- Total earnings per hour = $10 + $15 = $25.

Step 3: Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.
- She works 40 hours a week.
- Total earnings per week = 40 hours * $25/hour = $1,000.

Step 4: Determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the required amount.
- Total amount needed = $2,000.
- Total earnings per week = $1,000.
- Number of weeks needed = $2,000 / $1,000 = 2 weeks.

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up these costs to find the total amount spent so far:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so the remaining amount he can spend is:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"First, we need to determine the total number of packs Anne gave to her friends. She purchased a box with 15 packs and kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away:

\[ 15 - 2 = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces in the 13 packs she gave away. Each pack contains 60 pieces, so:

\[ 13 \times 60 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces equally to her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating the price increase over time. The formula is:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the future price of the carrots,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the carrots,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% increase),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album and then find out how many of those were selfies and portraits.

1. First, we find out how many pictures are in each album:
   \[
   \text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the total number of pictures in the 3 albums of selfies:
   \[
   \text{Number of selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies}
   \]

3. Then, we calculate the total number of pictures in the 2 albums of portraits:
   \[
   \text{Number of portraits} = 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits}
   \]

4. Finally, we add the number of selfies and portraits to get the total:
   \[
   \text{Total number of selfies and portraits} = 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45
   \]

Thus, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine the rate at which he reads and then use that rate to calculate the time for 18 pages.

First, we know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, his reading rate is:
\[ \text{Reading rate} = \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ pages per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We can use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Number of pages}}{\text{Reading rate}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{0.3 \text{ pages per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To determine the number of guests currently in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and update the number of guests accordingly.

1. **Initial number of guests:**
   The hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkouts:**
   24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
   So, 76 guests remain.

3. **Late checkouts:**
   15 guests elected for a late checkout.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
   So, 61 guests remain.

4. **Afternoon check-ins:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 guests checked in.
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
   So, 91 guests are now in the hotel.

5. **Evening check-ins:**
   7 more people checked in after dinner was served.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the proportional relationship between the number of sandwiches and the cost. We can use the first two packages to find the ratio.

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package has 4 sandwiches for $6. We can see that the cost per sandwich is consistent across these two packages:
- Cost per sandwich in the first package: $3 / 2 = $1.50
- Cost per sandwich in the second package: $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the cost per sandwich is $1.50, we can use this to find the cost of the third package, which contains 8 sandwiches:
- Cost of 8 sandwiches: 8 * $1.50 = $12

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give an extension to the whole class.
     - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
     - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60

3. **Personal Extension Scenario:**
   - If Marcus does not get a class extension, there is a 20% chance he can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
     - Probability of getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
     - Probability of not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.80

Now, we calculate the total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher: 0.50
- Probability of having the normal teacher and getting a class extension: \(0.50 \times 0.40 = 0.20\)
- Probability of having the normal teacher, not getting a class extension, but getting a personal extension: \(0.50 \times 0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.06\)

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
\[ 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76 \]

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college education, including the loans and the income he lost by not working, and then determine how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the income lost while in school:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Income lost over 4 years = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Income lost
   - Total cost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = 3 * $25,000 = $75,000 per year

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost of college:**
   - Annual income after college = $75,000
   - Total cost to be earned = $300,000
   - Time required = Total cost / Annual income

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

The length of each piece of fabric is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

The width of each piece of fabric is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Twice the amount he lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - He won $1 more than this: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   - Net change for the second race: \(+11\)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race: $11
   - Loss in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total net change for the day:
- First race: \(-5\)
- Second race: \(+11\)
- Third race: \(-16.5\)

Total net change:
\[
-5 + 11 - 16.5 = -10.5
\]

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net change by the number of races:
\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{-10.5}{3} = -3.5
\]

Since we are asked for the average loss, we take the absolute value:
\[
3.5
\]

Thus, the average loss per race is:
\[
\boxed{3.5}

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

The share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the fraction of a day they worked each day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

First, calculate the total number of days:
- 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Next, determine the fraction of a day they worked each day:
- They worked 3/8 of a day each day.

Convert the fraction of a day to hours:
- 1 day = 24 hours
- 3/8 of a day = (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours

Calculate the total hours worked by the team:
- Total hours per day = 9 hours
- Total hours over 21 days = 9 * 21 = 189 hours

Finally, divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked:
- Number of painters = 4
- Hours per painter = 189 / 4 = 47.25 hours

Each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for the price of the car after \( t \) years, given an initial price \( P_0 \) and a depreciation rate \( r \), is:
\[ P(t) = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

Here:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) (initial price in 2007)
- \( r = 0.21 \) (depreciation rate)
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \approx 0.493039 \]

Now, multiply by the initial price:
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times 0.493039 \approx 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately:
\[ 9860.78 \]

"To determine how much James pays for insurance in a year after his accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance.
2. Multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost.

First, let's find the increased monthly cost. The normal cost of the insurance is $120 per month. Since the cost increased by 60%, we calculate the increase as follows:

\[ \text{Increase} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:

\[ \text{New monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12:

\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

"To determine the number of laundry loads Greg does in a year, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Weekly Laundry Calculation:**
   - Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.
   - The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

2. **Twin Sheets:**
   - Greg needs to wash 4 twin sets of sheets each week.
   - Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, he needs to do:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads of twin sheets per week}
     \]

3. **King Sheets:**
   - Greg needs to wash 1 king set of sheets each week.
   - Since the machine can wash 1 king set at a time, he needs to do:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load of king sheets per week}
     \]

4. **Total Weekly Loads:**
   - Adding the loads for twin and king sheets:
     \[
     2 \text{ loads of twin sheets} + 1 \text{ load of king sheets} = 3 \text{ loads per week}
     \]

5. **Yearly Calculation:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Therefore, the total number of loads in a year is:
     \[

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week.
2. Determine the number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys each day.
3. Calculate the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey each day.

First, we know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats each day. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys each day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is:
\[ 24 \times 7 = 168 \text{ bananas} \]

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315, so the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
\[ 315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7:
\[ \frac{147}{7} = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."

"First, let's determine the cost of 15 roses. Since the price is $15 for a dozen (12 roses), we can calculate the cost of 15 roses as follows:

- Cost for 12 roses: $15
- Cost for 3 additional roses: 3 * $2 = $6

So, the total cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 + 6 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny arrives with five 5 dollar bills, which totals:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Jenny has left after buying the roses is:
\[ 25 - 21 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the remaining 4 dollars into quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so:
\[ 4 \div 0.25 = 16 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with:
\[ 16 \text{ quarters} \]

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved.

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach 200 toothpicks:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can calculate the number of additional weeks required to save 80 more toothpicks:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find out how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of seconds in 4 hours.
2. Calculate the number of jellyfish one spring can create in that time.
3. Multiply that number by 5 to account for all the springs.

First, convert 4 hours into seconds:
1 hour = 60 minutes
1 minute = 60 seconds
So, 4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 = 14400 seconds

Next, since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create:
14400 jellyfish

Since there are 5 springs, the total number of jellyfish created is:
14400 * 5 = 72000

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance James walked and then determine the time it took based on his walking speed.

1. **Distance to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Halfway to the store**: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
3. **Distance walked to the halfway point and back home**: 2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.
4. **Distance from home to the store after returning home**: 4 miles.

So, the total distance James walked is:
4 miles (to the halfway point and back home) + 4 miles (from home to the store) = 8 miles.

5. **Walking speed**: 4 miles per hour.

To find the total time taken, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought.
2. Determine the cost if she bought the bananas individually.
3. Determine the cost if she bought the bananas in bunches.
4. Calculate the savings by comparing the two costs.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought.**

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch averages 4 bananas:
\[
10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the cost if she bought the bananas individually.**

The cost of one banana is $0.80:
\[
40 \text{ bananas} \times 0.80 \text{ dollars per banana} = 32 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the cost if she bought the bananas in bunches.**

The cost of one bunch is $3.00:
\[
10 \text{ bunches} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars per bunch} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the savings.**

The savings is the difference between the cost of buying the bananas individually and the cost of buying them in bunches:
\[
32 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, the total amount of fence is 100 feet:
\[ S + H = 100 \]

It is also given that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam:
\[ H = S + 60 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S = 100 - 60 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field at the end of a 6-hour day, we need to calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

1. Calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer:
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the total number of bales produced is:
     \[
     5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales}

2. Calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck:
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the total number of bales picked up is:
     \[
     3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales}
     \]

3. Determine the number of bales left in the field:
   - Subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales produced by the farmer:
     \[
     30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales}

"First, let's calculate the total number of periods John has in a week. He has 6 periods each day for 5 days, plus 2 extra classes each day for 5 days:

\[ 6 \text{ periods/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} + 2 \text{ extra classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ periods/week} + 10 \text{ periods/week} = 40 \text{ periods/week} \]

Each period is 40 minutes long, so the total number of minutes he spends in class each week is:

\[ 40 \text{ periods/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, he spends an additional \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on Saturday and Sunday. The total extra learning time over the weekend is:

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes/week} = 100 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Adding the extra learning time to the regular class time gives the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 100 \text{ minutes/week} = 1700 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1700 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:

"Let's denote the total weight of the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms, which is \( \frac{x}{4} \).

So, we have:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 4:
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. Calculate the area of the east and west walls:
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

3. Calculate the total area of all four walls:
   - Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

4. Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we need to calculate the total time spent on these activities each day and then multiply by 5.

1. Calculate the total break time per day:
   - Bobby takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each.
   - Total break time per day = 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes.

2. Calculate the total time for lunch and breaks per day:
   - Lunch time per day = 30 minutes.
   - Total time per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

3. Convert the total time per day to hours:
   - 60 minutes = 1 hour.

4. Calculate the total time for 5 days:
   - Total time for 5 days = 5 * 1 hour = 5 hours.

So, the total time Bobby spends on lunches and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours.

"First, we determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran, we calculate:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8 miles
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Next, we calculate the total distance run by Amber and Micah:

Total distance (Amber + Micah) = Amber's distance + Micah's distance
Total distance (Amber + Micah) = 8 miles + 28 miles
Total distance (Amber + Micah) = 36 miles

Now, we find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the overall total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - Total distance (Amber + Micah)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - 36 miles
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for a 20-year retirement, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:**
   - Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Current annual salary = $100,000.
   - Annual retirement income needed = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.

2. **Calculate the total amount needed for 20 years of retirement:**
   - Total retirement savings needed = Annual retirement income needed * 20 years = $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

3. **Determine how much Lauren saves each year:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   - Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

4. **Calculate the number of years required to save $800,000:**
   - Number of years needed = Total retirement savings needed / Annual savings = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her 20-year retirement.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. 

Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now, we know the total number of students in the school is 600. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. The remaining stickers are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.
6. Since Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we have \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).

Now, solve for \( S \):

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \) (since they painted the same number of eggs). Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, with Camden painting 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \) and the number of eggs painted by Camden as \( C \).

From the problem, we have:
1. \( A + A + C + S = 56 \) (total eggs painted)
2. \( C + S = 30 \) (Camden and Sarah's total)
3. \( C = S + 12 \) (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

First, substitute \( C \) from equation 3 into equation 2:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 9 \) back into equation 3 to find \( C \):
\[ C = 9 + 12 \]
\[ C = 21 \]

Next, substitute \( C = 21 \) and \( S = 9 \) into equation 1 to find \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Thus, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons Nik can make.
2. Calculate the total number of boxes needed.
3. Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
4. Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
5. Add the weights of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight.
6. Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.

Step 1: Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons.
Nik has 200 crayons, and each group contains 8 crayons.
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of boxes needed.
Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, the number of boxes is equal to the number of groups.
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = 25 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons.
\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes.
\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 5: Add the weights of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight.
\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 6: Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking the 3 miles, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

1. **Determine Grandma's speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - Speed on the beach = \(\frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}\).

2. **Determine Grandma's speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \(2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\).

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Time on the sidewalk = \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has already saved.

Jane saves $4 every week. Over the past 8 weeks, she has saved:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can determine the number of additional weeks required to save $28 by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. 

1. Convert 2 dozen marbles to a numerical value:
   \[
   2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ marbles}
   \]

2. Let \( x \) be the number of marbles Bob currently has. According to the problem, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles:
   \[
   x + 24 = 60
   \]

3. Solve for \( x \):

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug such that the mixture in Donny's water bottle is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.

The total amount of water in the water bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The temperature of the mixture in the water bottle can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture \( T_m \) is:

\[
T_m = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5}
\]

We know that \( T_m \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[
4 \times 33 = 132
\]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T_2 \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[
T_2 \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:

\[
\boxed{68}

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the 21 days (3 weeks) and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Cows added per day**: 20
3. **Number of days**: 21

   Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

   Total cows after 21 days = Initial cows + Cows added
   Total cows after 21 days = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

4. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
5. **Chickens added per day**: 10
6. **Number of days**: 21

   Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

   Total chickens after 21 days = Initial chickens + Chickens added
   Total chickens after 21 days = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

7. **Total number of animals on the farm**:
   Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens
   Total animals = 470 + 230 = 700

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700.

"First, we calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted total:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we determine the total number of bagels in 4 packs:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per bagel:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

Thus, the cost per bagel is:

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to determine how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes during each period and then sum these amounts.

1. For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
   \[
   5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. The total number of eggs Chester eats over the 60 days is:
   \[
   90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
   \[
   \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"Let's start by defining the number of seashells each person collected. Let \( C \) represent the number of seashells Carlos collected, \( J \) represent the number of seashells Jim collected, and \( R \) represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jim collected 27 seashells.
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos.
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ J = 27 \]
\[ J = C + 5 \]
\[ C = 2R \]

First, substitute \( J = 27 \) into the second equation:
\[ 27 = C + 5 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 27 - 5 \]
\[ C = 22 \]

Next, substitute \( C = 22 \) into the third equation:
\[ 22 = 2R \]
Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{22}{2} \]
\[ R = 11 \]

Now, we know the number of seashells each person collected:
- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

The total number of seashells collected is:
\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person gets:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Thus, each person gets 20 seashells.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of the land for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - He sells another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30.
   - 1/4 of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.

3. **Third Sale:**
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The total amount from the third sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - Earnings from the first sale: $50
   - Earnings from the second sale: $30
   - Earnings from the third sale: $90
   - Total earnings: \( 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \) dollars

Thus, Abraham will be able to earn a total of $170 after selling all his unused land.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many eggs each person found and then subtract the total number of found eggs from the total number of hidden eggs.

1. **Total number of hidden eggs:**
   - Cole hid 3 dozen eggs.
   - 3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 eggs.

2. **Eggs found by each person:**
   - Lamar finds 5 eggs.
   - Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar: 2 × 5 = 10 eggs.
   - Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy: 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
   - Mei finds half as many as Charlie: 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

3. **Total number of eggs found:**
   - Total found = Lamar's eggs + Stacy's eggs + Charlie's eggs + Mei's eggs
   - Total found = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

4. **Number of eggs still hidden:**
   - Hidden eggs = Total hidden - Total found
   - Hidden eggs = 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 9.

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections John makes in a week.
4. Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.**

The first two complexes each have 200 apartments. Combined, they have:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ apartments} \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.**

The total number of apartments is:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections John makes in a week.**

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment:
\[ 1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 3120 \text{ collections/week} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.**

John gets paid $0.40 per collection:
\[ 3120 \text{ collections/week} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars/collection} = 1248 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the total amount of money John makes in a week is:
\[ 1248 \]

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we need to determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Next, we sum the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \), the length of the red rope as \( R \), and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R \) from the first equation into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Next, substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, substitute \( Y = 12 \) back into the second equation to find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ B = 12 - 7 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Finally, substitute \( B = 5 \) into the first equation to find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B \]
\[ R = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's start by determining how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, we have:
\[ \text{Rissa's initial amount} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, this amount is \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her initial amount. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his little sister. Ronnie's initial amount was $5, so after giving $3, he is left with:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of red paint used in the mural. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Paint Used:**
   The mural used a total of 12 pints of paint.

2. **Yellow Paint:**
   Half of the mural is yellow. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint used is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

3. **Remaining Paint:**
   The remaining paint is used for the red, white, and purple colors. The total amount of remaining paint is:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

4. **Equal Amounts of Red, White, and Purple Paint:**
   The problem states that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Let \( x \) be the amount of paint used for each of these colors. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   x + x + x = 6
   \]
   Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   3x = 6
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{6}{3} = 2
   \]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dishwasher pods are in the special size box and then calculate how many cycles can be run for $1.

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods can be bought for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods that can be bought for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Calculate the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1:**

"First, we determine the number of $20 bills Thomas initially withdraws. Since he withdraws $1000 in $20 bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 of these bills. The number of remaining bills is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

The number of bills he has left after paying the bill is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Each of these 20 bills is worth $20, so the total amount of money he has left is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. The new total amount of money he has is:

\[
400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money into $5 bills. The number of $5 bills he gets is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of goals scored by each team in both halves of the match and then sum them up.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)

4. **Total number of goals scored in the match:**

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, expand the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so in one hour, \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) snowballs melt.
   - Therefore, the net number of snowballs made in one hour is \( 20 - 8 = 12 \) snowballs.

2. **Calculate the time required to make 60 snowballs:**
   - If Jay makes 12 snowballs per hour, we need to find out how many hours it will take to make 60 snowballs.
   - The time required is \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) hours.

Thus, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine Jim's current age based on the information given.

1. **Identify the current ages:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.

2. **Determine the time frame:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.

3. **Calculate John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John's age 20 years ago: \( 28 - 20 = 8 \) years old.

4. **Set up the relationship between John's and Jim's ages when Digimon came out:**
   - When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - Let \( J \) be Jim's age when Digimon came out.
   - Therefore, \( 8 = 2J \).

5. **Solve for Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - \( J = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

6. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - Jim's current age: \( 4 + 20 = 24 \) years old.

Thus, Jim is currently 24 years old.

"To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to track the usage and orders over the three days and then work backwards.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
   - At the end of the first day, they had \( x - 38 + 50 \) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - They did not order any bandages on the second day.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \( (x - 38 + 50) - 28 \) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) bandages.
   - At the end of the third day, they had \( ((x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100) - 25 \) bandages.

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
((x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100) - 25 = 78
\]

Simplify the equation step by step:

\[
(x + 12) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
\]

\[
x + 12 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
\]

\[
x + 59 = 78
\]

Subtract 59 from both sides:

\[
x = 19
\]

Thus, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

\[
\boxed{19}

1. **Calculate the cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total number of visits in 5 years: \(3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ years} = 15 \text{ visits}\).
   - Total cost for 5 years: \(15 \text{ visits} \times 2 \text{ dollars/visit} = 30 \text{ dollars}\).

2. **Calculate the new cost of one visit after the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 is \(1.5 \times 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}\).
   - New cost of one visit: \(2 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Calculate the cost of visits after the price increase:**
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year.
   - The new cost of one visit is $5.
   - She visits the museum for 3 more years.
   - Total number of visits in 3 years: \(3 \text{ visits/year} \times 3 \text{ years} = 9 \text{ visits}\).

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles Brianna's family has.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - Each person has 1 flashlight.
   - There are 4 people.
   - Each room has 2 flashlights.
   - There are 8 rooms.

   Total flashlights = (flashlights per person * number of people) + (flashlights per room * number of rooms)
   Total flashlights = (1 * 4) + (2 * 8)
   Total flashlights = 4 + 16
   Total flashlights = 20

2. **Candles:**
   - Half the rooms have 4 small candles each.
   - The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each.
   - There are 8 rooms, so half of 8 is 4.

   Total small candles = 4 rooms * 4 small candles per room
   Total small candles = 16

   Total medium candles = 4 rooms * 5 medium candles per room
   Total medium candles = 20

   Total candles = Total small candles + Total medium candles
   Total candles = 16 + 20
   Total candles = 36

3. **Total items (candles and flashlights):**
   Total items = Total flashlights + Total candles
   Total items = 20 + 36
   Total items = 56

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:
\[ \text{Vanessa's speed} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Using her speed:
\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

First, calculate the total amount of line needed:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- There are 200 feet of dock.

\[ \text{Total line needed} = 3 \times 200 = 600 \text{ feet} \]

Next, subtract the amount of line he already has:
- He currently has 6 feet of new line.

\[ \text{Line to buy} = 600 - 6 = 594 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line.

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes a week, we need to calculate the total revenue from reservations for the days they are open.

1. Calculate the total cost per reservation:
   - 2 meals at $5 each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars
   - 1 bottle of wine at $5: \(5\) dollars
   - Total cost per reservation: \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars

2. Calculate the total revenue per night:
   - 6 reservations per night: \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars

3. Calculate the total revenue for the week:
   - Open 2 days a week: \(2 \times 90 = 180\) dollars

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

1. **Calculate the total cost price (CP) of the watermelons:**
   \[
   \text{Total CP} = \$80
   \]

2. **Determine the profit percentage:**
   \[
   \text{Profit percentage} = 25\%
   \]

3. **Calculate the total profit:**
   \[
   \text{Total profit} = \text{Total CP} \times \frac{\text{Profit percentage}}{100} = 80 \times \frac{25}{100} = 80 \times 0.25 = \$20
   \]

4. **Calculate the total selling price (SP):**
   \[
   \text{Total SP} = \text{Total CP} + \text{Total profit} = 80 + 20 = \$100
   \]

5. **Determine the selling price per watermelon:**
   \[
   \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total SP}}{\text{Number of watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = \$2
   \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - Therefore, John is currently \(18 + 19 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Therefore, the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - The number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - The number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"First, we calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original price is $400, and he gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price.

Cost of the radiator after discount:
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

Cost of labor:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

Total cost:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( k \) as the number of cows.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

"To determine how many slices each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 7 pizzas is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices.
