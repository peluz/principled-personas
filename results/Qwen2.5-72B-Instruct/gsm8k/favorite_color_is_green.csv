"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's find the new value of the house. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original value + 150% increase).

The original value of the house is $80,000. So, the new value is:
\[ 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the house, which is the purchase price plus the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ 70,000 \]

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day for all chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, we calculate the total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens:
- Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, we calculate the total amount of feed already given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Finally, we find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal:
- The total daily requirement is 60 cups.
- The feed already given is 40 cups.
- The feed needed for the final meal is \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, where every second glass is discounted to 60% of the regular price.

1. The cost of one glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Now, let's break down the purchase:
- For 16 glasses, there are 8 pairs of glasses.
- In each pair, the first glass costs $5 and the second glass costs $3.

So, the cost for one pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 8 pairs:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:

"Let's start by defining the number of sheep in each city based on the information given:

- Seattle has 20 sheep.
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so:
  \[
  \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
  \]
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so:
  \[
  \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
  \]

Now, we add the number of sheep in all three cities together:
\[
\text{Total sheep} = \text{Seattle's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
\]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the 200 GB file.
2. Add the time taken for the Windows restart.
3. Add the time to download the full 200 GB file again.

First, calculate 40% of the 200 GB file:
\[ 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \]

Next, calculate the time to download 80 GB at a rate of 2 GB/minute:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, add the 20 minutes for the Windows restart:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, add the time to download the full 200 GB file again:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Total time:

"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels:

- John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

Now, let's calculate the distance John travels on his way back:

- He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles.
- For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
- For the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours total - 2 hours in traffic - 0.5 hours at 30 mph), he drives at 80 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Total distance traveled on the way back:
- 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

Finally, let's calculate how far John is from home:
- Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
- Distance traveled back = 135 miles.
- Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay and her overtime pay.

1. **Regular Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost of Planting the Tree:**
   - $90

2. **Annual Revenue from Selling Lemons:**
   - 7 lemons per year
   - $1.5 per lemon
   - Annual revenue = 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5

3. **Annual Cost to Water and Feed the Tree:**
   - $3 per year

4. **Net Annual Profit:**
   - Net annual profit = Annual revenue - Annual cost
   - Net annual profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

5. **Number of Years to Recover Initial Cost:**
   - Initial cost = $90
   - Net annual profit = $7.5
   - Number of years to recover initial cost = Initial cost / Net annual profit
   - Number of years = $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so the number of vacuum cleaners sold to the red house is 2.
3. After selling to the green and red houses, the number of vacuum cleaners left is \( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.
5. After selling at the orange house, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so the equation is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = 5
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to complete the trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the time already spent hiking:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining time to complete the trail:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining distance to be hiked:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 6 \text{ miles}

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

Next, since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is:

\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Now, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to determine the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running, and then divide the distance by the time to get his speed.

1. **Total Distance**: John runs 60 miles a week.

2. **Total Time**:
   - On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
   - On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.
   - Total time for the other two days: \( 1.5 \times 2 = 3 \) hours.
   - Total time for the week: \( 3 + 3 = 6 \) hours.

3. **Speed**:
   - Speed is calculated as distance divided by time.
   - Speed = \( \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \).

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the distances she covers while running and walking over the given time.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - She spends one-third of the time running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - She spends two-thirds of the time walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we first need to determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. 

1. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies.
2. Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.

So, the total number of pie pieces is:
\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

"First, let's determine the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips. Since there are 5 servings in the bag and each serving has 250 calories:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target of 2000 calories. You have already consumed 1800 calories:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. Since each serving is 250 calories and the bag is 300g with 5 servings, each serving is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ g}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ g/serving} \]

To find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories, we use the ratio of calories to grams:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} \times 60 \text{ g/serving} = 48 \text{ g} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

   - Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - To make 20 candles, he needs \( \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \).

2. **Calculate the total cost of beeswax and wicks:**
   - One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00.
   - For 2 pounds of beeswax, the total cost is \( 2 \times 10.00 = 20.00 \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - For 20 candles, the total revenue is \( 20 \times 2.00 = 40.00 \).

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Net profit = \( 40.00 - 20.00 = 20.00 \).

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is \( 20.00 \).

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially from the total number of Post-it notes used to find out how many were in the package.

First, we know that Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. So, she used 220 Post-it notes in total.

Next, we know that she started with 80 Post-it notes and ended up with 23 Post-it notes remaining. We can set up the equation to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package:

\[
\text{Initial Post-it notes} + \text{Post-it notes in the package} - \text{Post-it notes used} = \text{Post-it notes remaining}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
80 + \text{Post-it notes in the package} - 220 = 23
\]

Solving for the number of Post-it notes in the package:

\[
80 + \text{Post-it notes in the package} - 220 = 23
\]

\[
\text{Post-it notes in the package} - 140 = 23
\]

\[
\text{Post-it notes in the package} = 23 + 140
\]

\[
\text{Post-it notes in the package} = 163

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

1. First, calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest:
   \[
   5 \text{ phones} \times \$150 \text{ per phone} = \$750
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total interest for all the phones:
   \[
   2\% \text{ interest} \times \$750 = 0.02 \times \$750 = \$15
   \]

3. Add the interest to the total cost to get the total amount Shiela will pay:
   \[
   \$750 + \$15 = \$765
   \]

4. Finally, divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:
   \[
   \frac{\$765}{3 \text{ months}} = \$255
   \]

So, Shiela will pay each month for 3 months:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar.
2. Calculate the total revenue for each type of flower based on the rounded prices and the number of pots sold.
3. Sum the total revenue for all types of flowers to find the total amount Artie will make.

### Step 1: Round the Prices
- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Revenue for Each Type of Flower
- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 = $36.00
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 = $18.00
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 = $34.00

### Step 3: Sum the Total Revenue
- Total revenue = $36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

So, the total amount Artie will make is:

"To find the average square footage of a level in the sandcastle, we need to determine the square footage of each level and then calculate the average.

Given:
- The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:
- 4th level: 16
- 3rd level: \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \)
- 2nd level: \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \)
- 1st level: \( 64 \times 2 = 128 \)

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

The average square footage of a level is:

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

1. **First 180 days:**
   - The puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - Total food needed for 180 days: \( 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \).

2. **Remaining days of the year:**
   - A year has 365 days.
   - Remaining days after the first 180 days: \( 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \).
   - The puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day.
   - Total food needed for the remaining 185 days: \( 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \).

3. **Total food needed for the first year:**
   - Total food needed: \( 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \).

4. **Number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed: \( \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \).

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the total cost of buying the flowers in packages of 3 and in packages of 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 3 = 6 packages.
- The total cost for 6 packages is 6 * $2.50 = $15.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.00.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 2 = 9 packages.
- The total cost for 9 packages is 9 * $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, we compare the two total costs:
- The cost for packages of 3 is $15.00.
- The cost for packages of 2 is $9.00.

The amount of money saved by buying the flowers in packages of 2 is:
$15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"First, we calculate the amount of water each girl received. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of 24 liters, we have:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters per girl} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, the boy received 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water given to the girls and the boy is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water initially available was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( W \) using the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate the number of cans used based on the initial volume.
3. Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.

First, since the volume of the tomatoes is halved when cooked into sauce, the initial volume of tomatoes must be twice the volume of the sauce. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so the initial volume of tomatoes is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Let's break down the information given:

1. Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes:
\[ x + 20 \]

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (the cars that took an exit).

The total number of cars that were originally on the motorway is the sum of the cars that drove through and the cars that did not drive through:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

"To find out how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total distance Julia rowed.
2. Calculate the total time it took her to row that distance.
3. Use the rate of water intake to find out how much water the boat took on.

First, we know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, so we can calculate the total distance she rowed:

\[
\text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we know the boat was taking on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can calculate the total amount of water taken on:

\[
\text{Total water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

So, the total amount of water the boat took on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of lessons per day.
2. Calculate the total number of cleanings per lesson.
3. Multiply the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson.

First, since each of the 4 teachers has 2 lessons per day, the total number of lessons per day is:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons/teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons/day} \]

Next, since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of cleanings per day is:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons/day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings/day} \]

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought.

For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Cost per board: $10
- Total cost for 10 boards: \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) dollars

For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Cost per board: $16
- Total cost for 5 boards: \( 5 \times 16 = 80 \) dollars

Total cost for all the lumber:
\[ 100 + 80 = 180 \] dollars

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber, given that prices have increased by 50%.

For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Original cost per board: $10
- New selling price per board: \( 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \) dollars
- Total selling price for 10 boards: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) dollars

For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Original cost per board: $16
- New selling price per board: \( 16 \times 1.5 = 24 \) dollars
- Total selling price for 5 boards: \( 5 \times 24 = 120 \) dollars

Total selling price for all the lumber:
\[ 150 + 120 = 270 \] dollars

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total selling price} - \text{Total cost} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 270 - 180 = 90 \] dollars

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were added on the second day. 

Initially, there were 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

"First, let's determine Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can write:

\[ 40000 = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Solving for Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. His salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years later. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add the two new salaries to find the total salary the two were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

\[ 99076.92 \]"

"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday:**
   - Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - She slept 2 hours less each day than on Monday.
   - Therefore, she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours each day.
   - For two days, she slept \(6 \times 2 = 12\) hours.

3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:**
   - She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   - Therefore, she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours each day.
   - For four days, she slept \(7 \times 4 = 28\) hours.

4. **Total hours slept throughout the week:**

"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break the problem into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

1. Calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour:
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

2. Calculate the remaining time she runs at 5 miles per hour:
   - Total time: 7 hours
   - Time already spent running at 10 miles per hour: 3 hours
   - Remaining time = Total time - Time already spent = 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours

3. Calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour:
   - Speed: 5 miles per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

4. Add the distances from both parts to get the total distance:
   - Total distance = Distance at 10 miles per hour + Distance at 5 miles per hour
   - Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is 50 miles.

"Debra initially sees 30 bees leave the hive. In the next 6 hours, she sees half that number return, which is 15 bees. Then, in the following 6 hours, she sees two times the initial 30 bees leave, which is 60 bees. Finally, in the last 6 hours, every bee that had left and not yet returned comes back. The total number of bees that left and had not returned is the sum of the first and third groups of bees (30 + 60) minus the bees that returned in the second period (15), which is 75 bees. Therefore, 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost for inflating the tires of the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get both tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
- The unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get it inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires is \(1 \times 1 = 1\).

Now, we add up all the tires:
\[10 + 9 + 1 = 20\]

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total cost is:
\[20 \times 0.25 = 5\]

Therefore, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. **Dave ate 14 fries.**
2. **The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate:**
   \[
   \text{Seagull ate} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ fries}
   \]

3. **Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:**
   \[
   \text{Pigeons ate} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]

4. **Total fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons:**
   \[
   14 + 7 + 9 = 30 \text{ fries}
   \]

5. **Let \( x \) be the total number of fries in the pack initially. After the seagull and pigeons, the remaining fries are:**
   \[
   x - 30
   \]

6. **A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:**
   \[
   \text{Raccoon ate} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30)
   \]

7. **The remaining fries after the raccoon:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30)
   \]

8. **Ants carried off one fry, leaving five behind:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]

9. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
   \]
   \[
   x - 30 = 18

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in class each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in the semester.

1. **Calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
   - He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
   - Therefore, each of these days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in class.
   - Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total for these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

2. **Calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
   - He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
   - Therefore, each of these days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in class.

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use feet for consistency.

1. **Convert the length of each type of baked good to feet:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long, so each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet.
   - Each baguette is already given as 2 feet long.

2. **Calculate the total length for each type of baked good:**
   - Total length of rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
   - Total length of croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
   - Total length of baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

3. **Add the total lengths together:**
   - Total length = 100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet.

The total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):

Let \( C \) represent the number of white carnations. According to the problem:
\[ 5C = 200 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ C = 40 \]

Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Next, we need to find out how many red roses she ordered. The problem states that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations:
\[ R = 4C \]
\[ R = 4 \times 40 \]
\[ R = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.

2. **Determine Jan's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's age two years ago: \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).

3. **Set up the equation for Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's current age.
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago: \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
   - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

4. **Solve for Mark's current age:**
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 19 + 2 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

5. **Determine Jean's age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Jean's age: \( 21 + 2 = 23 \).

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

### Well-Rounded Team:
Each of the four members runs their 400 meter leg in 55 seconds. Therefore, the total time for the well-rounded team is:
\[
4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Less Well-Rounded Team:
The first runner runs their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the times for each runner are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time for the less well-rounded team is:
\[
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Difference in Times:
The well-rounded team completes the race in 220 seconds, while the less well-rounded team completes the race in 222 seconds. The difference in their times is:
\[
222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the faster team wins by:
\[
2 \text{ seconds}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities:
     \[
     \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

4. **Expressing the result as a percentage:**
   - To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     2 \times 100 = 200\%
     \]

Therefore, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

   - Total straw for rats: \( 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 \) pieces

5. **Straw per Rat:**
   - Straw per rat: 6 pieces

6. **Total Number of Rats:**
   - Total number of rats: \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \)

7. **Number of Rats per Cage:**
   - Number of cages for rats: 3
   - Number of rats per cage: \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \)

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is invested or borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% monthly interest)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Plugging in the values:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict:

"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost price per bag is $20, and the transportation cost per bag is $2, so the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The selling price per bag is $30, so the profit per bag is:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The total profit made by the trader is $400. Therefore, the number of bags sold can be calculated by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

Thus, the trader sold 50 bags.

"First, let's calculate the total amount spent on food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so:

\[ \text{Cost of food} = \text{Cost of tickets} - 4.50 = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the rides. They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33:

\[ \text{Cost of rides} = 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of tickets} + \text{Cost of food} + \text{Cost of rides} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each of them paid:

\[ \text{Amount per person} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{3} = \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks.
2. Divide the weekly total by 7 to find the daily amount.

First, we know that one duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement by dividing by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: 50 trees.
2. **Net change in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.
3. **Number of years**: 10 years.

First, calculate the total number of trees after 10 years:
\[ \text{Total trees after 10 years} = \text{Initial trees} + (\text{Net increase per year} \times \text{Number of years}) \]
\[ \text{Total trees after 10 years} = 50 + (8 \times 10) \]
\[ \text{Total trees after 10 years} = 50 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total trees after 10 years} = 130 \]

Next, calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years:
\[ \text{Trees that die} = 30\% \text{ of total trees} \]
\[ \text{Trees that die} = 0.30 \times 130 \]
\[ \text{Trees that die} = 39 \]

Finally, calculate the number of trees left after 30% die:
\[ \text{Trees left} = \text{Total trees after 10 years} - \text{Trees that die} \]
\[ \text{Trees left} = 130 - 39 \]
\[ \text{Trees left} = 91 \]

So, the number of trees Tom has left is:

   - Sue had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Number of flamingos taken back and painted white on Saturday morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the 18 pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and put back out.

3. **Number of pink and white flamingos on Saturday morning:**
   - Pink flamingos left: \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - White flamingos added: 6.

4. **Number of flamingos added on Sunday morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - Total pink flamingos on Sunday morning: \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - Total white flamingos on Sunday morning: 6.

5. **Difference between the number of pink and white flamingos on Sunday noon:**
   - Number of pink flamingos: 30.
   - Number of white flamingos: 6.
   - Difference: \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Thus, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers.

First, we know that Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers, Mark's total weekly earnings are:

"To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score among the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total points needed for an average of 93 over the remaining five tests.
3. Determine the score required on the sixth test to reach this total.

First, let's identify the lowest score among the first five tests:
- Scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
- The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the total points needed for an average of 93 over the remaining five tests:
- The formula for the average is: \(\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Points}}{\text{Number of Tests}}\)
- We want the average to be 93 over 5 tests: \(93 = \frac{\text{Total Points}}{5}\)
- Therefore, the total points needed is: \(93 \times 5 = 465\)

Now, we need to find the sum of the remaining four scores after removing the lowest score:
- Sum of the remaining scores: \(89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367\)

To find the score needed on the sixth test, we set up the equation:
- Let \(x\) be the score on the sixth test.
- The total points including the sixth test should be 465: \(367 + x = 465\)

Solving for \(x\):
- \(x = 465 - 367\)
- \(x = 98\)

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of half a dozen plates.
2. Calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups.
3. Find the cost of one cup.

First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:
- Each plate costs $6000.
- Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
- Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates:
- Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup:

"To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
2 pairs * $20/pair = $40

The total cost for the jacket and shoes is:
$30 (jacket) + $40 (shoes) = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so the remaining amount she needs to earn is:
$70 (total cost) - $10 (saved) = $60

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns:
4 times * $5/time = $20

The remaining amount she needs after babysitting is:
$60 (remaining) - $20 (earned from babysitting) = $40

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she earns per lawn mowed:
$40 / $4/lawn = 10

Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day: 100 customers.
2. Determine the number of customers on the second day: 100 customers + 50 more = 150 customers.
3. Calculate the total number of customers for the first two days: 100 customers + 150 customers = 250 customers.
4. Given that the total number of customers by the end of the third day is 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total for the first two days from the total for the three days: 500 customers - 250 customers = 250 customers.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the problem, we know:
1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.
3. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

First, let's express the amount of water in each pool 4 minutes ago:
- 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the first condition:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

According to the second condition:
\[ B = 4S \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

Set the two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]

Solve for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt.
2. Divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total cost of the shoes and the belt:
   \[ \text{Total cost} = \$320.00 + \$32.00 = \$352.00 \]

2. Number of hours needed to work:
   \[ \text{Hours needed} = \frac{\$352.00}{\$8.00/\text{hour}} = 44 \text{ hours} \]

So, Lori will have to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back to find the remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:

"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian and Zack based on Harriet's age.

Harriet is 21 years old. Since Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \]

Harriet is half the age of Zack, so:
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
\[ \text{Adrian's age in 3 years} = 63 + 3 = 66 \]
\[ \text{Harriet's age in 3 years} = 21 + 3 = 24 \]
\[ \text{Zack's age in 3 years} = 42 + 3 = 45 \]

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we first need to determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna based on the information given.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi:
Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \).
Yuri scored \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
Brianna scored \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.

Now, we can calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \) points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points of the other three students from 251:
\( 251 - 197 = 54 \).

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

"First, we determine how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. The initial amount of water in the tank is 120 liters.

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

So, 30 liters of water are left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters.

Next, Celine collects rainwater that is twice the amount of what is left in the tank. Since 30 liters are left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

Therefore, the total amount of water in the tank now is 90 liters.

"First, let's determine the total number of Pokemon cards James has initially:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- James buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

Total new cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{32 \times 100}{96} = \frac{3200}{96} \approx 33.33\%
\]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home. This leaves:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

watermelons still on the farm. When Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. We calculate the number of watermelons ready at this point:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

So, Ashlyn took 63 more watermelons home. The number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Thus, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

"To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = \( 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \).

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Total tax = \( 10\% \times 240,000 = 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000 \).

3. **Registration fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Total registration fees = \( 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \).

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the cars + Tax + Registration fees
   - Total cost = \( 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \).

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we first need to calculate the number of cookies each of them ate over the two days and then convert that into calories.

On Monday:
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister, which is \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday:
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many as her sister, which is \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
- Sue's sister: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.
- Sue: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Next, we convert the number of cookies into calories. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories:
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

- There are 3 classes.
- Total students = 20 students/class * 3 classes = 60 students.

Step 2: Determine the total number of boys and girls in the school.
- The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
- Total boys = 50% of 60 students = 0.5 * 60 = 30 boys.
- Total girls = 50% of 60 students = 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls.

Step 3: Calculate the number of boys in the first and second classes.
- First class has 15 girls, so it has 20 - 15 = 5 boys.
- Second class has 12 girls, so it has 20 - 12 = 8 boys.

Step 4: Use the information to find the number of boys in the third class.
- Total boys in the school = 30 boys.
- Boys in the first class = 5 boys.
- Boys in the second class = 8 boys.
- Boys in the third class = Total boys - (Boys in the first class + Boys in the second class) = 30 - (5 + 8) = 30 - 13 = 17 boys.

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 17.

"To find out how many animals Rick killed, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. **Determine the number of cougars killed today:**
   - Last night, Rick killed 15 cougars.
   - Today, he killed three fewer cougars than last night.
   - Number of cougars killed today = 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

2. **Determine the number of wolves killed today:**
   - Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
   - Number of wolves killed today = 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

3. **Calculate the total number of animals killed today:**
   - Total animals killed today = 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals.

4. **Calculate the total number of animals killed over both days:**
   - Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals.
   - Total animals killed over both days = 25 animals (last night) + 48 animals (today) = 73 animals.

"First, let's determine the total number of cows before Mr. Sylas buys any additional cows. There are 10 stalls, each with 20 cows:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. The number of new cows per stall is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of cows in each stall after the new cows are added. Each stall originally had 20 cows and now has 2 additional cows:
\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Finally, we need to determine the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls:
\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 22 \text{ cows/stall} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \)

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. In the second week, they each doubled their output:

- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Now, we add the stories from both weeks for each person:

- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we add the total number of stories written by all three:

\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has before buying the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth \(5 \times 25 = 125\) cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth \(2 \times 10 = 20\) cents.

Adding these together, Kelly has \(125 + 20 = 145\) cents.

Next, we subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has.

\(145 - 55 = 90\) cents.

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has.
2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
3. Use the information that their total is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out to find the total number of medals.

Step 1: Determine the number of medals Izzy has.
- Ali has 22 medals.
- Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
- Therefore, Izzy has \( 22 - 5 = 17 \) medals.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
- Ali has 22 medals.
- Izzy has 17 medals.
- Together, they have \( 22 + 17 = 39 \) medals.

Step 3: Use the information that their total is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out.
- Let \( T \) be the total number of medals given out.
- According to the problem, \( 39 = \frac{T}{10} \).
- To find \( T \), multiply both sides by 10: \( T = 39 \times 10 = 390 \).

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Six years ago, the population was \(P / 2\).
   - We know that \(P / 2 = 60000\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Thus, the current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem:

- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. If the total number of electric wires is 45, we can use the ratio to find the number of electric poles.

Let the number of electric poles be \( P \). According to the ratio, the number of electric wires is 3 times the number of electric poles, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3P = 45 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To solve the problem, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of people at the beginning of the party:
   \[
   25 \text{ men} + 15 \text{ women} = 40 \text{ people}
   \]

2. Determine the number of people who left after an hour:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ people}
   \]

3. Calculate the number of people who stayed:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30 \text{ people}
   \]

4. We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Therefore, the number of women who stayed is:
   \[
   30 \text{ people} - 22 \text{ men} = 8 \text{ women}
   \]

So, the number of women left is:

"First, let's determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. Jam has a total of 26 pencils, with 2 loose pencils, so the pencils in the boxes total:

26 pencils - 2 loose pencils = 24 pencils

Since these 24 pencils are evenly distributed among 3 boxes, each box contains:

24 pencils / 3 boxes = 8 pencils per box

Now, let's find out how many boxes Meg needs for her 46 pencils. If each box can hold 8 pencils, then the number of boxes Meg needs is:

46 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 5.75 boxes

Since Meg cannot have a fraction of a box, she will need 6 boxes to store all her pencils.

Now, we add the number of boxes Jam and Meg need together:

Jam's boxes: 3
Meg's boxes: 6

Total boxes needed: 3 + 6 = 9

"To find out how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need to calculate the number of ice cubes required:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Added Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees.
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

3. **Determine the monthly salary of a senior programmer:**
   - The monthly salary of a junior programmer is $2000.
   - The monthly salary of a senior programmer is $400 more than that of a junior programmer.
   \[
   \text{Monthly salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
   \]

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers:**
   - The number of junior programmers is 40.
   - The monthly salary of each junior programmer is $2000.
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
   \]

5. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers:**
   - The number of senior programmers is 60.
   - The monthly salary of each senior programmer is $2400.
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
   \]

6. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all programmers:**
   - The total monthly salary for all programmers is the sum of the total monthly salaries for junior and senior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary for all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got in. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:
\[
(x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6
\]

We are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, so:
\[
x + 6 = 20
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = 20 - 6 = 14
\]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has:

24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

He then passes 14 out to his friends, so he has:

22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends, which is:

2 * 14 = 28 lollipops.

Adding these to the 8 he has left, he now has:

8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so he has:

36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has:

33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to determine the total percentage of charge required:

100% - 60% = 40%

Next, we know the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find out how many minutes it will take to charge 40 percentage-points, we multiply:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

Finally, to convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This shopping trip, the customer spent $43. They used their $4 in rewards, and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of the rewards off the price. 

\[ \text{Coupon value} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied to this shopping trip:

\[ \text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine which job offers Nick a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs after accounting for taxes and other deductions.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Annual hours: 2000
- Annual gross pay: \( 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \)
- State tax rate: 20%
- Net pay after tax: \( 30,000 \times (1 - 0.20) = 30,000 \times 0.80 = 24,000 \)

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net pay after property tax: \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \)
- State tax rate: 10%
- Net pay after state tax: \( 36,000 \times (1 - 0.10) = 36,000 \times 0.90 = 32,400 \)

Now, we compare the net pay from both jobs:
- Net pay from Job A: $24,000
- Net pay from Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
\[ 32,400 - 24,000 = 8,400 \]

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A.

\[ 200 + 75 = 275 \]

Next, we add the money she already has in her savings:
\[ 80 + 275 = 355 \]

The phone costs $400, so we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone to find out how much more she needs:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \]

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save:

"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost for the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

This $2 is half of the change he received after buying the candy. Therefore, the total change he received is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Billy started with $10, the amount he spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount he spent by the cost per pound:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is:
\[ 4 \]

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can write this relationship as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip (from the first city to the second, then to the third, and back to the first city).
2. Multiply this distance by 3 to find the total distance traveled in one day.
3. Determine how many days it takes for the train to travel 18,000 miles.

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance for one complete trip

- Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- Distance from the third city to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles

Total distance for one complete trip:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled in one day

The train makes this trip 3 times a day:
\[ 300 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips/day} = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

### Step 3: Determine how many days it takes to travel 18,000 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles:
\[ \frac{18,000 \text{ miles}}{900 \text{ miles/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

So, the train goes between services every 20 days.

"To determine how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to find out how much stuffing is required for a collie bed. 

1. Calculate the average amount of stuffing for a collie bed:
   - A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is \((8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5\) pounds.

2. Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
   - Each chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - Therefore, 4 chihuahua beds take \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of stuffing.

3. Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:
   - Each collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.
   - Therefore, 3 collie beds take \(3 \times 5 = 15\) pounds of stuffing.

4. Add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds:
   - Total stuffing needed = 8 pounds (for chihuahua beds) + 15 pounds (for collie beds) = 23 pounds.

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she has to pay back, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, calculate the interest on the loan:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

The principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.50 \]

Next, calculate the total amount to be paid back:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50 \]

Now, divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5} \]

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.

He sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.

According to the problem, the amount of land he has left is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8

"To find the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time spent recording the song.
2. Convert all times to the same unit (minutes).
3. Calculate the total work time.
4. Determine the percentage of the total work time spent editing.

**Step 1: Calculate the time spent recording the song.**
Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. She spends half that much time recording it:
\[ \text{Time spent recording} = \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{2} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Convert all times to minutes.**
- Time spent writing: \( 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \)
- Time spent recording: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \)
- Time spent editing: \( 90 \text{ minutes} \)

**Step 3: Calculate the total work time.**
\[ \text{Total work time} = 240 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 4: Determine the percentage of the total work time spent editing.**
\[ \text{Percentage spent editing} = \left( \frac{90 \text{ minutes}}{450 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

"To find out how many books Wendy will need, we first need to determine the number of books that can be placed in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. This is calculated by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns:

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 books

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double this number. First, we double the number of books:

36 books * 2 = 72 books

Then, we add 20 more books to this amount:

72 books + 20 books = 92 books

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

"First, let's determine the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had. She made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with each box containing 15 cards. 

The total number of pre-made cards is:
2 boxes * 15 cards/box = 30 cards

Adding the cards she made:
20 cards + 30 cards = 50 cards

Next, we calculate the total number of cards Erica passed out:
24 cards to her classmates + 5 cards to her family = 29 cards

Subtract the number of cards she passed out from the total number of cards she initially had:
50 cards - 29 cards = 21 cards

Finally, we add the number of cards she received from family and friends:
21 cards + 17 cards = 38 cards

So, the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has is:

- Bill gets 1/3 of 12 slices, which is 12 * (1/3) = 4 slices.
- Mark gets 1/4 of 12 slices, which is 12 * (1/4) = 3 slices.

Next, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark and the slices Jenny eats:

- Total slices given away and eaten = 4 (Bill) + 3 (Mark) + 2 (Jenny) = 9 slices.

Finally, we subtract the total slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices:

- Slices left = 12 - 9 = 3 slices.

2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.
3. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.
4. Multiply the total number of days worked in a year by the daily pay rate.

Step 1: The builder works 6 days every week.
Step 2: The builder works 4 weeks every month, so the number of days worked in a month is:
\[ 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

Step 3: There are 12 months in a year, so the number of days worked in a year is:
\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

Step 4: The builder gets paid $50 every day, so the total earnings in a year are:

"To find out how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
2. Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Compute the total cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Determine the number of sandwiches needed.**
Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, for 20 people:
\[ \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches:
\[ \text{Total meat required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total cheese required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 3: Compute the total cost of the meat and cheese.**
The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore:
\[ \text{Total cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars/pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Total cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars/pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns and cannolis at Allan's house.

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \).

Next, Allan buys more cannolis and corns:

3. Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \( 40 + 60 = 100 \).
4. Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so the number of corns he buys is \( 100 - 40 = 60 \).

Now, let's find the new total number of corns:

5. The new total number of corns is \( 80 + 60 = 140 \).

Finally, we find the combined total of corns and cannolis:

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he walked 5,000 steps. He also walked 1,000 steps with his friend. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we can calculate the total steps he had taken before the jog and subtract that from the total steps he had left to reach his goal after the jog.

Steps taken before the jog: 5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps.

Total steps needed to reach the goal: 10,000 - 2,000 (steps left) = 8,000 steps.

Therefore, the steps taken during the jog: 8,000 (total steps needed) - 6,000 (steps before the jog) = 2,000 steps.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to calculate the payments for each month and then sum them up.

### May:
- Number of employees: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in May: 4 (assuming a typical 4-week month)

First, calculate the weekly pay for one employee:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, calculate the monthly pay for one employee:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 2400 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, calculate the total pay for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \text{ dollars/employee} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

### June:
- Number of employees at the start of June: 40
- Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
- Number of employees remaining: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

Using the same calculations as for May:

   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from the jogger jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the savings from the tattered jeans:**
   - The rest of the savings came from the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the tattered jeans is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 after a $4 savings.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 after a $2 savings.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

6. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by both the homemade and store-bought bird feeders.

1. Lillian builds 3 homemade bird feeders.
2. Lillian buys 3 store-bought bird feeders.
3. Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds.
4. Each homemade bird feeder attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought one, so each homemade bird feeder attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade and store-bought bird feeders:

- Total birds attracted by homemade feeders: \(3 \times 30 = 90\)
- Total birds attracted by store-bought feeders: \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see each day:

\[ 90 + 60 = 150 \]

"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for the dinner she ordered, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel**: $4
2. **Cost of the soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 
   - 25% of $4 is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \)
   - Therefore, the cost of the soup is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) dollars.
3. **Cost of the cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel.
   - Half of $4 is \( 4 / 2 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:
- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

Total cost: \( 4 + 5 + 2 = 11 \) dollars.

"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}C \) cards.

Each card is sold for $1.5, so the total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}C \).

This amount of money is enough to buy the $100 ticket and leave him with $50 in spending cash, so the total amount of money he makes is $150.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}C = 150 \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}C = 1.5 \times \frac{2C}{3} = 1 \times C = C \]

So:
\[ C = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - Most guests would eat one hotdog, but he prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, the caterer prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 36 guests * 1 hotdog/guest = 36 hotdogs for the first hotdogs.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (first hotdogs) + 36 (second hotdogs) = 72 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer had 72 hotdogs prepared.
   - The total hotdogs needed were 80.
   - Shortage of hotdogs = 80 - 72 = 8 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest wanted a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the shortage of hotdogs.
   - Therefore, 8 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. 

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of the letters in Indras' name is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \). 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this half, so the number of letters in her sister's name is \( 3 + 4 = 7 \).

Now, we add the number of letters in both names to find the total:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

So, the final cost of her order is $132.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many candy bars George bought. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount George spent:**
   - George had $5 initially.
   - He had 1% of his money left, which means he had \( 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \) dollars left.
   - Therefore, the amount he spent is \( 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40.
   - The total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the amount spent on candy bars:**
   - The total amount spent is $4.95.
   - The amount spent on chips is $1.20.
   - The amount spent on candy bars is \( 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the number of candy bars:**

"First, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]

\[ P = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]

\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

30 minutes is half an hour, so the distance the horse runs is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse will eat for running 16 miles. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, so:
\[ \text{Hay needed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Sugar cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Next, we sum the total weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats)
- Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since the farmer can't make a partial trip).

- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt has to eat to get five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Cost of morning rides:
   \[
   14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ rides/day} \times \$6 \text{ per ride} = 14 \times 2 \times 6 = 168
   \]

2. Cost of afternoon rides:
   \[
   14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ rides/day} \times \$2 \text{ per ride} = 14 \times 2 \times 2 = 56
   \]

3. Total cost:
   \[
   168 + 56 = 224
   \]

So, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:

\[
224

"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:

\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we find the total number of oranges they have together:

\[ 50 + 70 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie:

\[ \frac{120}{3} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Thus, the number of Greek orange pies they can make is:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation for each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( n \).

For the first venue:
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food is $5 per person.
- The total cost for the first venue is \( 200 + 5n \).

For the second venue:
- The cost is $25 per person.
- The total cost for the second venue is \( 25n \).

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

To solve for \( n \), we first subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20n \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ n = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Bodhi as \( B \), and by Lily as \( L \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, we substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( L \):
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then convert that to yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. 

First, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Next, we convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein to yards. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of cows on the farm**: 30 cows
2. **Number of sheep on the zoo**: 20 sheep

Next, we need to verify the given conditions:

- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
  - Number of cows on the zoo = 2 * Number of cows on the farm
  - Number of cows on the zoo = 2 * 30 = 60 cows

- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.
  - Number of sheep on the farm = 1/2 * Number of sheep on the zoo
  - Number of sheep on the farm = 1/2 * 20 = 10 sheep

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo:

- **Total animals on the farm**:
  - Cows on the farm: 30
  - Sheep on the farm: 10
  - Total on the farm = 30 + 10 = 40 animals

- **Total animals on the zoo**:
  - Cows on the zoo: 60
  - Sheep on the zoo: 20
  - Total on the zoo = 60 + 20 = 80 animals

- **Combined total of animals**:
  - Total on the farm + Total on the zoo = 40 + 80 = 120 animals

Therefore, the combined total number of animals on the farm and the zoo is:

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can set up the following equations:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

Substitute \( H = 3L \) into the first equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, substitute \( L = 30,000 \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000.

"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem:

- Let \( O_c \) represent the number of chairs Ophelia has.
- Let \( O_s \) represent the number of sofas Ophelia has.
- Let \( J_c \) represent the number of chairs Jenna has.
- Let \( J_s \) represent the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( O_s = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( O_s = O_c - 2 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( J_c = 3 \times O_c \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( J_s = J_c - 2 \).

First, we solve for \( O_c \) using the information that Ophelia has 20 sofas:
\[ O_s = O_c - 2 \]
\[ 20 = O_c - 2 \]
\[ O_c = 22 \]

Next, we find \( J_c \) using the relationship between Jenna's and Ophelia's chairs:
\[ J_c = 3 \times O_c \]
\[ J_c = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ J_c = 66 \]

Now, we find \( J_s \) using the relationship between Jenna's sofas and chairs:
\[ J_s = J_c - 2 \]
\[ J_s = 66 - 2 \]
\[ J_s = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = O_s + J_s = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = O_c + J_c = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 people get on the bus:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
4. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus. ""3 times fewer"" means one-third of the number who got off:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   So, 7 people get on the bus:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:
\[
66

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Determine Jame's current age:
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. Determine Jame's age in 8 years:
   - Jame's current age is 22.
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \).

3. Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:
   - In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. Determine the cousin's current age:
   - The cousin will be 55 in 8 years.
   - Therefore, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. Determine the age difference between Jame and his cousin:
   - Jame's current age is 22.
   - The cousin's current age is 47.
   - The age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much one monitor costs, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the cost of the computer, which is given as $1,100.
2. Determine the cost of the printer, which is $400 less than the computer. So, the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.
3. Calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 (computer) + $700 (printer) = $1,800.
4. Subtract the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total amount spent to find the cost of the 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.
5. Divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300.

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

1. **Determine the number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**
   - Therefore, the total savings in the first half of April is \( 15x \).

4. **Since Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half:**
   - The amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \).
   - Therefore, the total savings in the second half of April is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

5. **Set up the equation to meet the monthly saving target:**
   - Total savings in April = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 15x + 30x = 1125 \)
   - \( 45x = 1125 \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   - \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April."

Next, we calculate Bob's weight. Since Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, we have:

Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 * 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, we find the total weight of the three friends:

Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds
Total weight = 540 pounds

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:

Average weight = Total weight / 3
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3

"First, we need to determine the ages of James's two sons. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, which means the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we calculate the total number of candles needed. The older son needs 12 candles, and the younger son needs 8 candles. Therefore, the total number of candles required is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since each pack contains 5 candles, we need to determine how many packs are required to get at least 20 candles. We divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is 4 * 3 = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the 100 pages she read in the second week.

First, we calculate the total reading time in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- So, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we convert the total reading time in the first week into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).
- The total number of pages read in the first week is \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

Now, we add the pages read in the second week:
- In the second week, she read 100 pages.

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
2. Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month.
3. Determine the difference between the total number of roses ordered and the total number of roses grown.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month. Assuming a month has 4 weeks:

\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 160 \text{ roses/month} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month. The first shop orders 20 roses, the second shop orders 15 roses, and the third shop orders 30 roses per week. So, the total number of roses ordered per week is:

\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses/week} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of roses ordered in a month:

\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 260 \text{ roses/month} \]

Finally, we determine the difference between the total number of roses ordered and the total number of roses grown:

\[ 260 \text{ roses/month} - 160 \text{ roses/month} = 100 \text{ roses/month} \]

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to find the correct setting for 520 degrees.

1. **Determine the percentage error:**
   - The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it reaches 468 degrees.
   - The difference is \( 468 - 450 = 18 \) degrees.
   - The percentage error is \( \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \).

2. **Apply the percentage error to the desired temperature:**
   - The recipe calls for 520 degrees.
   - If the oven is off by 4%, we need to find the setting \( x \) such that \( x \) plus 4% of \( x \) equals 520.
   - This can be expressed as \( x + 0.04x = 520 \).
   - Simplifying, \( 1.04x = 520 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), \( x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \).

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. So, the second movie is:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"Let's break down the spending:

- On Monday, Howard spends $8.
- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the total amount spent over the three days:

- Total spent = $8 (Monday) + $16 (Tuesday) + $64 (Wednesday) = $88.

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:

- $100 - $88 = $12.

"To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate his earnings for each period and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, in one hour, he earned \( 15 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50 \text{ per cup} = \$7.50 \).

For four hours, his earnings are:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times \$7.50 \text{ per hour} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, in one hour, he earned \( 10 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60 \text{ per cup} = \$6.00 \).

For two hours, his earnings are:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times \$6.00 \text{ per hour} = \$12.00 \]

Finally, we sum the earnings from both periods:
\[ \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

So, Patrick earned a total of:

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires can handle before needing replacement.
3. Calculate how many months the tires will last.
4. Convert the number of months into years.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations in one month.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. 

First, find the number of 2-mile segments in 400 miles:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/segment}} = 200 \text{ segments} \]

Next, calculate the total number of rotations in one month:
\[ 200 \text{ segments} \times 725 \text{ rotations/segment} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations the tires can handle.**

Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 3: Calculate how many months the tires will last.**

\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations/month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

**Step 4: Convert the number of months into years.**

\[ \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

So, the tires will last for 6 years before they need to be replaced.

"If the jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings using 2 pumps per wash, then using 1 pump per wash would double the number of washings to 240. The cost per pump, therefore, would be the total cost divided by the number of washings when using 1 pump per wash.

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{\$24.00}{240 \text{ washings}} = \$0.10 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.10 to cents:

\[ \$0.10 = 10 \text{ cents} \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is:

\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount to the total cost. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost. So, we calculate 70% of $60:

\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42, the amount of money he will have left is:

\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

So, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.

"To find the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of cars towed in the first three days and the number of cars towed in the remaining four days.

1. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
   \]

2. For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars each day than the 10 cars it pulled on the first three days. So, the number of cars towed each day for the remaining four days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. 

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, while Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap at this rate. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and see how many classes he can miss while keeping the cost per class below or equal to $10.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. The total number of classes is 10.
3. The cost per class if he attends all 10 classes is \( \frac{60}{10} = 6 \) dollars per class.

If Manny misses some classes, the cost per class will increase. We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss while keeping the cost per class at or below $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class when he misses \( x \) classes is \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \).

Solving the inequality:
\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

Multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

Simplify:
\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

Subtract 100 from both sides:
\[
-40 \leq -10x
\]

Divide both sides by -10 (and reverse the inequality sign):
\[
4 \geq x
\]

So, \( x \leq 4 \).

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we can start by determining how many miles Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we calculate:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3 \]

Substituting the distance Reggie ran into the equation:

\[ 20 = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3 \]

Solving for Lynn's distance:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find out how much money Tim will make in a year with his new salary and bonus, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise.
2. Calculate the annual salary based on the new monthly salary.
3. Calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary based on the new monthly salary.
4. Add the annual salary and the bonus to get the total annual income.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **New Monthly Salary:**
   \[
   \text{New Monthly Salary} = \text{Old Monthly Salary} + (\text{Old Monthly Salary} \times 0.05)
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Monthly Salary} = 20000 + (20000 \times 0.05) = 20000 + 1000 = 21000
   \]

2. **Annual Salary:**
   \[
   \text{Annual Salary} = \text{New Monthly Salary} \times 12
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual Salary} = 21000 \times 12 = 252000
   \]

3. **Bonus:**
   \[
   \text{Bonus} = \text{New Monthly Salary} \times 0.5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Bonus} = 21000 \times 0.5 = 10500
   \]

4. **Total Annual Income:**
   \[
   \text{Total Annual Income} = \text{Annual Salary} + \text{Bonus}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Annual Income} = 252000 + 10500 = 262500
   \]

So, Tim will make $262,500 in a year.

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the sales from green hats in the first month.
2. Calculate the total sales for the first month.
3. Calculate the total sales for the second month.
4. Sum the total sales for both months.

**Step 1: Determine the sales from green hats in the first month.**

Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total sales for the first month.**

The total sales for the first month are the sum of the sales from red hats and green hats:
\[ \text{Total sales for the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total sales for the second month.**

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:
\[ \text{Total sales for the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

**Step 4: Sum the total sales for both months.**

The total sales for both months are:
\[ \text{Total sales for both months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:
\[ \boxed{2100} \]"

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books, so:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Determine the total growth needed to reach 600 inches.
3. Calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the needed amount.

First, convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches:
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- 20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

Next, determine the total growth needed to reach 600 inches:
- Total height needed = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Growth needed = 600 - 240 = 360 inches

Now, calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches:
- The bamboo grows 30 inches per day
- Number of days = 360 / 30 = 12 days

So, the bamboo will reach 600 inches in 12 days.

"James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs. There are 8 more dogs, so he needs to buy 8 toys to have enough for all 12 dogs. After buying the toys, he finds out there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are now 24 dogs (12 original dogs + 12 additional dogs). He then buys 12 more toys to have enough for all 24 dogs. When he comes back, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs. Therefore, he now needs 21 toys in total (24 - 3).

"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps of the investments made by Dylan and Frances.

1. **Determine Dylan's investment:**
   Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining amount after Dylan's investment:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

3. **Determine Frances's investment:**
   Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{1440}{3} = 480

"To solve this, we can set up a proportion based on the information given:

6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

We need to find out how many hash browns (let's call this number \( x \)) can be made from 96 potatoes.

The proportion is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}} \]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[ 6x = 36 \times 96 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{36 \times 96}{6} \]
\[ x = \frac{3456}{6} \]
\[ x = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes.

"To find out by how much the group exceeds the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults and then compare it to the maximum load.

1. Calculate the total weight of the 8 other adults:
   \[
   8 \text{ adults} \times 80 \text{ kg/adult} = 640 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. Add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults. Assuming Jack's weight is also 80 kg:
   \[
   640 \text{ kg} + 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. Subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight to find the excess:
   \[
   720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg}
   \]

The group exceeds the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"Let's denote the number of cookies that the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

From the problem, we know:
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: \( M = C + 12 \)
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: \( K = M - 5 \)
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: \( S = M + 23 \)
- Katarina has 68 cookies: \( K = 68 \)

First, we can find the number of cookies Max has:
\[ K = M - 5 \]
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Next, we can find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has:
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Now, we can find the number of cookies Summer has:
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Finally, we can find the total number of cookies:
\[ \text{Total} = K + M + C + S \]
\[ \text{Total} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 298 \]

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as \( L \).

1. Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after this extension is:
   \[
   L + 0.5L = 1.5L
   \]

2. She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom of the dress, making the final length:
   \[
   1.5L + 20
   \]

3. We know the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   1.5L + 20 = 140
   \]

4. To solve for \( L \), first subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   1.5L = 120
   \]

5. Then, divide both sides by 1.5:
   \[
   L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris took to mow half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

1. **Turtle Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - Therefore, to mow half of the lawn, it would take him \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes.

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, to mow half of the lawn, it would take him \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to mow the lawn by using both modes is the sum of the time taken in each mode.
   - Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

Thus, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the combined ages equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):

\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have saved after ten years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of coins Rong saves per month.
2. Calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month.
3. Calculate the total number of coins saved by each over ten years.
4. Add the totals to get the combined savings.

1. Rong saves 20 coins every month.

2. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. 
   - 2/5 of 20 coins is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) coins.
   - Therefore, Neil saves \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) coins every month.

3. Calculate the total savings over ten years (120 months):
   - Rong's total savings: \( 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \).
   - Neil's total savings: \( 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \).

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20, so the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Let \( T \) be the total bill. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we can write:
\[ \text{Heartworm check} = 0.60T \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

"To find the total number of squares in Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The number of red squares is given as 14.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24.

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter in square feet is the same as the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the information about Topher's shoes.

1. First, convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches.
   - 8 feet = 8 * 12 inches = 96 inches
   - 8 feet 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

2. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.
   - According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
   - This can be written as: \( 100 = 9x + 10 \)

3. Solve for \( x \):
   - Subtract 10 from both sides: \( 100 - 10 = 9x \)
   - Simplify: \( 90 = 9x \)
   - Divide both sides by 9: \( x = \frac{90}{9} \)
   - Simplify: \( x = 10 \)

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students:
\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \]

Now, to find the number of boys in each class:
\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers:**
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers is \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.
   - She has \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers left.

3. **Trading Large Stickers:**
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers is \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.
   - She has \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers left.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so she gets \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Small buttons: \( 27 \) (from trading small stickers) + \( 60 \) (from trading large stickers) = \( 87 \) small buttons.
   - Large buttons: \( 20 \) large buttons.

6. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Total buttons = \( 87 \) small buttons + \( 20 \) large buttons = \( 107 \) buttons.

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:

\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is also 33. This can be expressed as:

\[ F + A = 33 \]

We can substitute \( F = 2A \) into the second equation:

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):

\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since it needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To find the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, and then add these distances together.

1. **Calculate the driving distance:**
   - They drove for 6 hours.
   - Their average driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - Distance driven = Time × Speed = 6 hours × 50 miles/hour = 300 miles.

2. **Calculate the hiking distance:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - Their average hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed = 50 miles/hour ÷ 2 = 25 miles/hour.
   - Hiking speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour.
   - Distance hiked = Time × Speed = 1.5 hours × 20 miles/hour = 30 miles.

3. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.

Thus, the total distance to their vacation spot is 330 miles.

"Let's break down the scoring for both Ava and Emma based on the given information.

1. **Points for enemies jumped on:**
   - Let the number of enemies Emma jumps on be \( E \).
   - Then, the number of enemies Ava jumps on is \( E + 8 \).
   - Points for Emma: \( 10E \)
   - Points for Ava: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)

2. **Points for berries collected:**
   - Let the number of berries Emma collects be \( B \).
   - Then, the number of berries Ava collects is \( B + 3 \).
   - Points for Emma: \( 5B \)
   - Points for Ava: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)

3. **Points for time left:**
   - Let the time left for Emma be \( T \) seconds.
   - Then, the time left for Ava is \( T - 4 \) seconds.
   - Points for Emma: \( 30T \)
   - Points for Ava: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)

Now, let's calculate the total scores for both Ava and Emma.

- **Total score for Emma:**
  \[
  10E + 5B + 30T
  \]

- **Total score for Ava:**
  \[
  10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
  \]

The difference between Ava's score and Emma's score is:
\[
(10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) = -25
\]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is:

"To find out how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of rides on the usual days and the number of rides on the special days.

1. **Usual Days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - This happens for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides per day = 2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day.
   - This happens for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of orange fish he bought
- \( y \) as the number of white fish he bought

So, we have:
\[ x + y = 17 \]

After adding the new fish, the total number of fish in the pond is:
- Orange fish: \( 3 + x \)
- White fish: \( 4 + y \)

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:
\[ 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \]
\[ 3 + x = 8 + 2y \]
\[ x - 2y = 5 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( x + y = 17 \)
2. \( x - 2y = 5 \)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From the first equation:
\[ x = 17 - y \]

Substitute \( x \) in the second equation:
\[ 17 - y - 2y = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3y = 5 \]
\[ -3y = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3y = -12 \]
\[ y = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify, substitute \( y = 4 \) back into the first equation:
\[ x + 4 = 17 \]
\[ x = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish. Let's check the final condition:
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \)
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)

Indeed, 16 is twice 8, so the condition is satisfied.

The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives each week.
2. Determine the total amount of gas used each week.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gas used each week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Andy drives each week.**

Andy drives to work and back home each day, so the round trip distance is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles/day} \]

Since he drives from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of gas used each week.**

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon. Therefore, the total amount of gas used each week is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the gas used each week.**

The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the total cost of gas each week is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:
\[ 15 \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt:

- She received ten $20 bills, so the total from the twenties is \(10 \times 20 = 200\) dollars.
- She also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total from the quarters is \(140 \times 0.25 = 35\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the amount of money she spent:

- She spent all the quarters, which is $35.
- She spent \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the twenties. The total amount from the twenties is $200, so \( \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \) dollars.

Now, we add the amounts she spent:

- Total spent = $35 (quarters) + $120 (twenties) = $155.

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for the lunch is:

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of groups formed.
2. Calculate the number of groups that each had members bring back seashells.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of groups formed.**

The total number of people is 90, and each group consists of 9 people. Therefore, the total number of groups is:
\[ \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of groups that each had members bring back seashells.**

According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups had members bring back seashells. So, we need to find \(\frac{3}{5}\) of 10:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups.**

Each of these 6 groups had 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back by one group is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Since there are 6 such groups, the total number of seashells brought back is:
\[ 6 \times 18 = 108 \]

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in a week. We can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
\]

\[
\text{Total branches} = 420
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7}
\]

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = 60
\]

So, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[
60

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of petals Rose picked initially and then subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped.

1. **Initial Petals:**
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

2. **Total Petals Initially:**
   \[
   15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}

"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used and lost:

- John makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
- They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

So, the total number of marshmallows used and lost is:
9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows.

Now, subtract this from the total number of marshmallows in the bag:
35 (total) - 21 (used and lost) = 14 marshmallows left.

Since they want to share the remaining marshmallows equally, divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:
14 / 2 = 7.

Each kid can have 7 more S'mores.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

We know the total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
z + z + s + s + 2s = 10
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2z + 2s + 2s = 10
\]

\[
2z + 4s = 10
\]

Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( s \) in the equation:

\[
2z + 4(2z) = 10
\]

\[
2z + 8z = 10
\]

\[
10z = 10
\]

\[
z = 1
\]

Now, find \( s \):

\[
s = 2z = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]

Finally, find the amount of oil:

\[
\text{Amount of oil} = 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4
\]

Thus, the amount of oil Tanya uses is:

\[

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Since there are 20 students, and they each raised the same amount, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250.

"To find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John completes in one day.
2. Multiply the number of tasks per day by the payment per task to find his daily earnings.
3. Multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week to find his weekly earnings.

Step 1: Total number of tasks per day
- John does 30 cycles a day.
- Each cycle has 5 tasks.
- Total tasks per day = 30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Step 2: Daily earnings
- Each task pays $1.20.
- Daily earnings = 150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

Step 3: Weekly earnings
- John works 7 days a week.
- Weekly earnings = $180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week

Therefore, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then use that to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) (distance per hour).
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance, the total distance \( D \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times v \times 18
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the same distance:**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of 4 turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours}

"First, let's determine the number of socks and dishes each person has.

Jack has 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, the number of socks Jack has is:
\[ \text{Jack's socks} = \frac{\text{Jack's dishes}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack:
\[ \text{Peter's socks} = 2 \times \text{Jack's socks} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack:
\[ \text{Peter's dishes} = \frac{\text{Jack's dishes}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
\[ \text{Total socks} = \text{Jack's socks} + \text{Peter's socks} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total dishes} = \text{Jack's dishes} + \text{Peter's dishes} = 60 + 30 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total items} = \text{Total socks} + \text{Total dishes} = 90 + 90 = 180 \]

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

First, we know:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

The total number of students in the class is 20. We can find the number of students who are good at both subjects by subtracting the number of students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - 5 - 8 = 7 \]

So, 7 students are good at both math and English.

Next, we add the number of students who are good at math only to the number of students who are good at both subjects to find the total number of students who are good at math:

\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group will take, including their setup, performance, and exit, and then account for the intermission.

1. Calculate the total time for each group:
   - Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
   - Time to perform: 6 minutes
   - Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes
   - Total time per group: 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

2. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. Subtract the 10-minute intermission:
   - Total concert time: 120 minutes
   - Time after intermission: 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

3. Determine how many groups can perform in the remaining time:
   - Number of groups: 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11.

"To find out how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest earned and then add it to the original amount.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 \]

However, the rate should be a fraction of the principal, not a dollar amount. The correct rate is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \]

Now, calculate the interest correctly:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 675 \]

Next, add the interest to the original principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 975 \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ 975 \]"

- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together, they have 85 books: \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne: \( S = A + 25 \)
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn: \( A = F - 12 \)

We can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to solve for \( F \).

First, substitute \( A = F - 12 \) into \( S = A + 25 \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute \( S = F + 13 \) and \( A = F - 12 \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and Sarah will buy a 20-meter rope, so the cost will be:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope:

\[ 40 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve the problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 24 - 8 = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly has in her cart:

1. The total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
2. Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since 5 packs of bacon cost $10, one pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, each pack of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4. With 6 packs of chicken, the total cost is 6 * $4 = $24.
3. Each pack of strawberries costs $4. With 3 packs, the total cost is 3 * $4 = $12.
4. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2. With 7 packs, the total cost is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost of bacon: $10
- Total cost of chicken: $24
- Total cost of strawberries: $12
- Total cost of apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:
$65 - $60 = $5

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run for, we need to first subtract the time of the encore from the total runtime of the final concert. 

The final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes long. The encore itself is 15 minutes long. So, the length of the final concert without the encore is:

65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Since the final concert (excluding the encore) is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can find the length of her usual concerts by dividing this time by 2:

50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of a thingamabob.
2. Use the speed of a thingamabob to find the speed of a whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the following equation to find the speed of a thingamabob:

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of a whatchamacallit}}{11} \]

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} \]

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount they spent and then divide it by 2, since they had the same amount of allowance.

1. Cost of the cake: $11
2. Cost of the balloons: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons, so 12 / 2 = 6 sets of 2 balloons, and 6 sets * $0.5 = $3
3. Cost of the ice cream: 2 tubs at $7 each, so 2 * $7 = $14

Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since the total cost is $28 and this amount is the combined allowance of Julia and Nadine, each of them must have received half of this amount.

"To find out how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.**

Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
Total number of lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

**Step 4: Calculate the profit.**

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"To find out how many pets Larry has, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats:
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7
   \]
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits:
   \[
   \text{Number of fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has:
   \[
   \text{Number of gerbils} = \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Now, let's add up all the pets:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of rabbits} + \text{Number of fish} + \text{Number of gerbils}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to first figure out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.

1. The sloth takes 4 hours for one complete trip (down, pick berries, and back up).
2. In 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8}{4} = 2 \) complete trips.

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and he can make 2 trips in that time, the number of berries he needs to pick up per trip is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries per trip} \]

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is:

"First, we need to determine the amount of water Anthony and his father fill into the tank. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool. Since the pool has 10,000 gallons of water, the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Therefore, the total amount of water emptied after 6 days is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin.
3. Multiply the calories of a mini cinnamon roll by the number of mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Multiply the calories of a mini blueberry muffin by the number of mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

First, we calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Calories in a mini cinnamon roll = 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Next, we calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Calories in a mini blueberry muffin = 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we calculate the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls:
- Number of mini cinnamon rolls = 200.
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls = 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, we calculate the total calories for the mini blueberry muffins:
- Number of mini blueberry muffins = 300.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins = 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

Thus, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday.
2. Sum the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday.
3. Divide the total by the number of days (5) to find the average.

First, let's calculate the number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday:
- On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
- On Tuesday, she removed \( 2 \times 39 = 78 \) Junebugs.
- On Wednesday, she removed \( 2 \times 39 = 78 \) Junebugs.

Next, we sum the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday:
- Monday: 39
- Tuesday: 78
- Wednesday: 78
- Thursday: 48
- Friday: 57

Total number of Junebugs removed:
\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 \]

Now, we divide the total by the number of days (5) to find the average:
\[ \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The distance the bus traveled is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

The distance the car traveled is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

The difference in distance traveled is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( L \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

"First, let's determine the initial number of water balloons Maria and her friends had. Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so:

\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ water balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ water balloons} \]

Maria had 1 water balloon for herself, so the total number of water balloons at the start is:

\[ 8 \text{ water balloons} + 1 \text{ water balloon} = 9 \text{ water balloons} \]

Next, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more water balloons. There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ water balloons per person} = 15 \text{ water balloons} \]

Adding these to the initial total, the final number of water balloons is:

\[ 9 \text{ water balloons} + 15 \text{ water balloons} = 24 \text{ water balloons} \]

So, the total number of water balloons the girls had is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time James spends swimming the initial distance:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Rest time = \( 6 \) hours / 2 = 3 hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.

   - Total commission from 10 copies = 10 * $1.20 = $12.00.

3. **Total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
   - Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15.00.

"To find Leo's age, we first need to determine Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26 years old.

So, Marcus's age is:
26 - 5 = 21

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo’s age. Therefore, Leo’s age is:
21 * 2 = 42

So, Leo is 42 years old.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the team is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us the following equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:

\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the expressions for \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"First, let's determine how many 15-minute intervals there are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 4 \text{ intervals/hour} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours Vince was stapling reports:
\[ 11:00 \text{ PM} - 8:00 \text{ AM} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we find the total number of 15-minute intervals in 15 hours:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 4 \text{ intervals/hour} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
2. Subtract the time she was sleepwalking.
3. Adjust for the 5 minutes she woke up earlier.

First, let's calculate the total number of minutes Kim usually sleeps:
- From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
- 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

Next, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking:
- She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
- 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

So, the time she was not sleeping on her bed due to sleepwalking is 23 minutes.

Now, we adjust for the 5 minutes she woke up earlier:
- She woke up 5 minutes earlier than 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
- From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes.
- 7 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 55 minutes = 420 + 55 = 475 minutes.

Finally, we subtract the 23 minutes she was sleepwalking from the 475 minutes she was in bed:
- 475 minutes - 23 minutes = 452 minutes.

So, the total number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 452.

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons left with Jonathan is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of utensils (measuring cups + measuring spoons) Jonathan has remaining:

\[ \text{Total utensils} = 24 \text{ (measuring cups)} + 10 \text{ (measuring spoons)} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day and there are 14 days in 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds to the total patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

"If Kelly is right and Courtney overstated the number of people in attendance by 20%, we can find the actual number of people who attended the concert by adjusting Courtney's reported number accordingly.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number (48) is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = x + 0.2x \]
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow the sequence of events and the given conditions.

1. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.
2. They dug 13 holes on the second day.
3. They dug 8 holes on the third day but filled in 2 holes, so the net number of holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\).

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so four times this number is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day. The total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 29 + x = 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 40 - 29 \]
\[ x = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, substitute \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the third equation to find \( S \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

1. **Distance traveled south in the first leg:**
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \times 30 = 300 \) miles

2. **Distance traveled north in the second leg:**
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \times 18 = 36 \) miles

3. **Distance traveled south in the third leg:**
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \times 22 = 110 \) miles

Now, we sum the distances traveled south and subtract the distance traveled north:

- Total distance south: \( 300 + 110 = 410 \) miles
- Total distance north: \( 36 \) miles

Net distance traveled south: \( 410 - 36 = 374 \) miles

   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

2. **Determine his dad's age when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Therefore, his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.

3. **Determine his dad's current age:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.

4. **Determine his brother's age when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Therefore, his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

5. **Determine his brother's current age:**

"To find out how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the total cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply that by 5.

First, calculate the cost for one basket:
- Cost of 3 petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00 per petunia = $9.00
- Cost of 2 sweet potato vines: 2 vines * $2.50 per vine = $5.00

Total cost for one basket: $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

Now, multiply the cost of one basket by the number of baskets:
- Total cost for 5 baskets: 5 baskets * $14.00 per basket = $70.00

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds

The total amount of soil in the bag is 30 pounds. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations to find out how much soil is left for the roses:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break the problem into two parts: peeling and cooking.

1. **Peeling Time:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:
     \[
     \text{Peeling time} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking Time:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To cook 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can cook in one batch and then multiply by the time it takes to cook one batch:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cooking time} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - Add the peeling time and the cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Air conditioner on low for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate on low: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \( 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees} \)

2. **Air conditioner on high for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate on high: 3 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \( 3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees} \)

3. **Air conditioner off for 2 hours:**
   - Warming rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total warming: \( 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees} \)

Now, we sum up the total cooling and warming effects:
- Total cooling: \( 6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees} \)
- Total warming: \( 4 \text{ degrees} \)

The net change in temperature is:
- Net change: \( 18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees} \)

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to add up the checks he writes for each of his expenses:

1. **Electric bill:** 1 check per month
2. **Gas bill:** 1 check per month
3. **Church:** 2 checks per month
4. **Pest and lawn service:** 1 check per quarter (4 times a year)

First, we calculate the total number of checks he writes per month:

- Electric bill: 1 check
- Gas bill: 1 check
- Church: 2 checks

Total checks per month = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks

Next, we calculate the total number of checks he writes per year for the monthly expenses:

- 4 checks per month * 12 months = 48 checks

Now, we add the checks for the quarterly pest and lawn service:

- 1 check per quarter * 4 quarters = 4 checks

Finally, we add the checks for the monthly expenses and the quarterly expenses:

- 48 checks (monthly) + 4 checks (quarterly) = 52 checks

So, Buford writes 52 checks per year.

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \).

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France and the number of flights to Germany are each \( \frac{1}{8}F \) (since \( 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} \) is split equally between France and Germany).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes is twice the number of flights the second plane makes:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can find the number of flights to France:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount given to him by his mother and father and then subtract this from the cost of the trousers.

1. Adam's mother gave him $6.
2. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Now, we add the amounts given by his mother and father:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

The total cost of the trousers is $30. Therefore, the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \) years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

We are given that the total age of the children is 20 years:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( L \):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is:
- 4 kids' slices: \( 4x \)
- 2 adults' slices: \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \)

So, the total watermelon is divided into:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

"To find out the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 0.07 \times 3x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.79x = 28 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):

   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 0.09 \times 5y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is 35.44%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.55y = 35.44 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{35.44}{0.55} \approx 64.44\%
     \]

Thus, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 64.44%.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save and then determine her weekly earnings.

1. Calculate the down payment amount:
   - The cost of the car is $10,000.
   - Janet wants to save 20% of this amount.
   - Down payment = 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.

2. Calculate Janet's hourly earnings:
   - She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips.
   - Total hourly earnings = $10 + $15 = $25.

3. Calculate Janet's weekly earnings:
   - She works 40 hours a week.
   - Weekly earnings = 40 hours * $25/hour = $1,000.

4. Determine how many weeks she needs to work to save the down payment:
   - Total amount needed = $2,000.
   - Weekly savings = $1,000.
   - Number of weeks = $2,000 / $1,000 = 2 weeks.

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment for the car.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add up these costs:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar has $10, so the remaining amount he can spend is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Plums cost $0.25 each, so the number of plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"First, we need to determine the total number of packs Anne gave to her friends. She had 15 packs and kept 2, so she gave away:

15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces in the 13 packs she gave away. Each pack contains 60 pieces, so:

13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces

Now, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends to find out how many pieces each friend received:

780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces/friend

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]

First, calculate \( 1 + 0.05 \):

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, raise 1.05 to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

"James reads 18 pages of his book. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read 18 pages by setting up a proportion:

If 3 pages = 10 minutes,
then 18 pages = \( x \) minutes.

To find \( x \), we can use the equation:
\[ x = \frac{18 \text{ pages} \times 10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]

\[ x = \frac{180}{3} \]

\[ x = 60 \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the proportional relationship between the number of sandwiches and the cost.

First, let's look at the given packages:
- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.

We can see that the cost per sandwich is consistent across these two packages:
- For the first package: \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) dollars per sandwich.
- For the second package: \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) dollars per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package should also be $1.5.

Now, we calculate the cost for the third package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost for 8 sandwiches = \( 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \) dollars.

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college education and the income he lost while in school, and then determine how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Jim takes 4 years to finish college.
   - He gets $50,000 in loans per year.
   - Total loans: \( 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the income lost while in school:**
   - Jim had a job paying $25,000 per year before college.
   - He did not work for 4 years.
   - Total income lost: \( 4 \times 25,000 = 100,000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn to cover the loans and lost income:**
   - Total amount: \( 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income: \( 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000 \) dollars per year.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total amount:**

"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we first determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces he needs. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, and Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider on each side. This means:

- The length of the fabric piece will be 6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet.
- The width of the fabric piece will be 8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet.

Each piece of fabric will therefore measure 8 feet by 10 feet. To find the area of one piece of fabric, we multiply the length by the width:

8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:

80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the fraction of a day they worked each day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

First, calculate the total number of days:
- 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Next, determine the fraction of a day they worked each day:
- They worked 3/8 of a day each day.

Convert the fraction of a day to hours:
- 1 day = 24 hours
- 3/8 of a day = (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours

Calculate the total hours worked by the team:
- Total hours per day = 9 hours
- Total hours over 21 days = 9 * 21 = 189 hours

Finally, divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked:
- Number of painters = 4
- Hours per painter = 189 / 4 = 47.25 hours

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for the price of the car after \( t \) years, given an initial price \( P \) and an annual depreciation rate \( r \), is:
\[ P(t) = P \times (1 - r)^t \]

Here:
- \( P = 20000 \) (initial price of the car)
- \( r = 0.21 \) (annual depreciation rate)
- \( t = 3 \) (number of years from 2007 to 2010)

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.493039 \]

Now, multiply by the initial price:
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P(3) = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ 9860.78 \]

"To find out how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The cost of the tank top is $10.
2. The cost of the running shorts is $5 more than the tank top, so it is $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The original price of the tennis shoes is $48, but they were on sale for half price, so the cost is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The cost of the athletic socks is $8, but Alison had a coupon for $2 off, so the cost is $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, we add the cost of all the items together:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55.

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of food the cats eat in one day.
2. Divide the total amount of food Imma has by the daily consumption to find out how many days it will last.

First, we know that Imma feeds her cats 60 grams of food per meal, and she feeds them twice a day. Therefore, the total amount of food consumed per day is:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of food by the daily consumption:
\[ 720 \text{ grams} \div 120 \text{ grams/day} = 6 \text{ days} \]

"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each spent, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which took 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by all monkeys in a week.
2. Determine the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys.
3. Subtract the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find the daily consumption of the third monkey.

First, we know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we calculate the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Now, we find the total daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day.
- The second monkey eats 14 bananas per day.
- Together, they eat \(10 + 14 = 24\) bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas eaten by all monkeys in a week is 315, the total daily consumption for all three monkeys is:
\[ \frac{315 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Finally, we subtract the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find the daily consumption of the third monkey:
\[ 45 \text{ bananas per day} - 24 \text{ bananas per day} = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

\text{Price Mr. Rogers sold to his friend} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
\]

**Step 3: Determine the discount Mr. Roger's friend received from the original price.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Roger's friend paid $1800.

\[
\text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200
\]

**Step 4: Convert this discount into a percentage of the original price.**

\[
\text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
\]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price is:

"To find out how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of seconds in 4 hours.
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 = 14400 seconds

2. Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours.
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, it would create 14400 jellyfish.

3. Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours.
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish, then 5 springs would create 5 * 14400 = 72000 jellyfish.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat.
2. Before the Allosaurus ate, the velociraptors had scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means the 270 kilograms is half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged.
3. Therefore, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate and before the velociraptors scavenged was \( 270 \times 2 = 540 \) kilograms.
4. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms is half of the total meat on the triceratops.
5. Therefore, the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was \( 540 \times 2 = 1080 \) kilograms.

So, the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse blinks and then use that rate to find out how long it will take for 459 blinks.

1. First, find the rate of blinks per minute:
   \[
   \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
   \]

2. Next, use the rate to find the time it takes for 459 blinks:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}
   \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

1. **Initial Count:**
   - Male guppies: 4
   - Female guppies: 7
   - Male goldfish: 3
   - Female goldfish: 5

2. **Fish Purchased:**
   - Male guppies: 2
   - Female guppies: 1
   - Male goldfish: 2
   - Female goldfish: 3

3. **Total Count After Purchase:**
   - Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
   - Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
   - Total male goldfish: 3 + 2 = 5
   - Total female goldfish: 5 + 3 = 8

4. **Total Male and Female Fish:**
   - Total male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfish) = 11
   - Total female fish: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfish) = 16

"To find the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person spent on their respective tasks and then sum these times.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

Now, we sum the times for all three:
- Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
- Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

"To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the one-way distance to his parents' house:
   - Time taken to drive one way = 2 hours
   - Speed = 70 mph
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

2. Calculate the round trip distance:
   - Round trip distance = One-way distance × 2 = 140 miles × 2 = 280 miles

3. Calculate the total distance driven in a month:
   - John visits his parents twice a month
   - Total monthly distance = Round trip distance × Number of visits = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

So, the total distance John drives in a month when visiting his parents is 560 miles.

"To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of toys needed to determine how many toys the fifth worker produced.
3. Divide the number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked to find the hourly production rate.

Let's start with step 1:

- The first 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each. So, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The next 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each. So, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.
- Combined, the first 4 workers produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Now, calculate the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in 10 hours:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

Next, step 2:
- The total order is for 400 toys.
- By the end of the shift, they still need 20 more toys to complete the order.
- Therefore, the number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys} \]

Finally, step 3:
- The fifth worker produced 180 toys in 10 hours.
- The hourly production rate for the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

So, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs, we first need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory’s dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the remaining half of the stickers to Kris, so Kris received \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total.
6. Since Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we have \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).

Now, solve for \( S \):

\[
\frac{S}{4} = 16
\]

\[
S = 16 \times 4
\]

\[
S = 64
\]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"First, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's John has. Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags, so the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each ounce contains 30 M&M's, so the total number of M&M's is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M's per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M's} \]

John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, so the number of small bags he can make is:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M's}}{10 \text{ M&M's per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance that is half of the way around the Earth.
2. Calculate how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance.

First, the circumference of the Earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of the way around the Earth is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Liam is currently 16 years old.
2. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
3. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince. So, if we let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago, we have:
   \[
   14 = 2V
   \]
4. Solving for \( V \):
   \[
   V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
5. This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago.
6. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total eggs painted by all four:**
   \[
   A + M + C + S = 56
   \]

2. **Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs:**
   \[
   A = M
   \]

3. **Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs:**
   \[
   C + S = 30
   \]

4. **Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah:**
   \[
   C = S + 12
   \]

First, substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into the equation \( C + S = 30 \):
\[
(S + 12) + S = 30
\]
\[
2S + 12 = 30
\]
\[
2S = 18
\]
\[
S = 9
\]

Now, find \( C \):
\[
C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21
\]

Next, substitute \( C = 21 \) and \( S = 9 \) into the total eggs equation:
\[
A + M + 21 + 9 = 56
\]
\[
A + M + 30 = 56
\]
\[
A + M = 26
\]

Since \( A = M \):
\[
2A = 26
\]
\[
A = 13
\]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[
C - A = 21 - 13 = 8
\]

Thus, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boxes needed.
2. Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
3. Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
4. Add the weights of the boxes and the crayons.
5. Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.

**Step 1: Determine the number of boxes needed.**

Nik has 200 crayons and each box holds 8 crayons. So, the number of boxes needed is:
\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the boxes.**

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes. So, the total weight of the boxes is:
\[ 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the crayons.**

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons. So, the total weight of the crayons is:
\[ 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

**Step 4: Add the weights of the boxes and the crayons.**

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

**Step 5: Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.**

There are 16 ounces in a pound. So, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money they all have together, we add Valerie's salary, her brother's salary, and their mother's salary:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

1. **Determine Grandma's speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - Speed on the beach = \(\frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}\).

2. **Determine Grandma's speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \(2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\).

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Time on the sidewalk = \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes.

"To solve the problem, let's first determine how many marbles Bob has initially. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the initial number of marbles:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from his initial number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that would allow Donny to drink the mixed water.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug.
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of water from the second mug. The final temperature \( T_f \) can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures:

\[
T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{4 + 1}
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5}
\]

Donny can drink the water if \( T_f \) is at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40
\]

To solve for \( T_2 \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by 5:

\[
132 + T_2 \geq 200
\]

Next, we subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T_2 \geq 68
\]

Thus, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"First, let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Let's calculate the number of scoops Gomer ate:
23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, let's determine how many potatoes are needed to make the scoops of mashed potatoes:
3 less than 6 potatoes = 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes
1 less than 3 scoops = 3 - 1 = 2 scoops

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops.

To find the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops

Each rock is sold for $7.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the rocks.
The total cost is the amount Adam spent to buy the rocks.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \times 5 = 100 \]

Step 4: Find the difference between the total cost and the total revenue to determine the loss.
\[ \text{Loss} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total revenue} = 100 - 84 = 16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16.

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to calculate the individual probabilities of each ticket winning and then multiply these probabilities together.

1. The probability that the first ticket wins is given as 20%, or 0.20.
2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability that the second ticket wins is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

Now, we multiply the probabilities of both tickets winning:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells.
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos.
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.

First, we find out how many seashells Carlos collected:
\[ \text{Carlos's seashells} = \text{Jim's seashells} - 5 = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we determine how many seashells Carrey collected:
\[ \text{Carrey's seashells} = \frac{\text{Carlos's seashells}}{2} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of seashells collected by all three:
\[ \text{Total seashells} = \text{Jim's seashells} + \text{Carlos's seashells} + \text{Carrey's seashells} = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

Finally, we divide the total number of seashells equally among the three:
\[ \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{\text{Total seashells}}{3} = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Each person gets 20 seashells.

1. Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.
2. Determine the total cost of the devices bought on Monday and Tuesday.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the devices.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.
- Linus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount.
- Selling price = 2 * $20 = $40

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the devices bought on Monday and Tuesday.
- Cost of 2 devices on Monday = 2 * $20 = $40
- Cost of 4 devices on Tuesday = 4 * $20 = $80
- Total cost = $40 + $80 = $120

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the devices.
- Total number of devices sold = 2 (Monday) + 4 (Tuesday) = 6 devices
- Total revenue = 6 * $40 = $240

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles are needed (since 100% / 20% = 5 bottles).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - Total bottles needed = 2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles.

3. **Determine how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
   - Additional bottles needed = Total bottles needed - Current production = 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

2. Determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections he makes in a week.
4. Compute the total amount of money he makes based on the number of collections and the rate per collection.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.**

The first two complexes each have 200 apartments. Combined, they have:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:
\[ 400 \times 1.60 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.**

The total number of apartments is:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total length of the ropes:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

2. **Amount Given to Their Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of pods in the special size box.
2. Calculate the cost per pod for the special size box.
3. Determine how many pods you can get for $1.
4. Since 1 pod is used per cycle, the number of pods you can get for $1 is the number of cycles you can run.

First, the special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box. The regular box has 100 pods, so the special size box has:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} + (0.20 \times 100 \text{ pods}) = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The cost of the special size box is $12. Therefore, the cost per pod for the special size box is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

To find out how many pods you can get for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per pod:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Therefore, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Therefore, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of teeth the dentist drills.
2. Determine the number of teeth the dentist caps.
3. Calculate the total number of teeth fixed.
4. Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed out of the total number of teeth.

Step 1: The dentist drills 4 teeth.
Step 2: The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:
\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Step 3: The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy:
   \[
   \text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount of money}}{\text{Cost per book}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{500} = 54
   \]

2. Since Bob distributes the books equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:
   \[
   \text{Number of books per school} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{3}

"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
3. Now, there are 1 (from the first event) + 5 (from the second event) = 6 apples on the ground.
4. Newton picked up these 6 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing another 6 apples to fall.
5. Now, there are 1 (left from the previous step) + 6 (from the third event) = 7 apples on the ground.
6. Newton picked up all 7 apples and went home.

To find the total number of apples Newton brought home, we add the apples he put in his pocket:
- 1 apple from the first event
- 5 apples from the second event
- 6 apples from the third event

Total apples in his pocket: 1 + 5 + 6 = 12

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices of each type of pizza her friends will consume and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:
- Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices.
- There are 6 friends.

\[
6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ cheese pizza slices}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese pizzas are required. Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices:
\[
\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas}
\]

Now, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:
- Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices.
- There are 6 friends.

\[
4 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 24 \text{ pepperoni pizza slices}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many whole pepperoni pizzas are required. Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas}
\]

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour and then calculate how long it will take him to reach 60 snowballs.

1. **Determine the net number of snowballs made per hour:**
   - Jay makes 20 snowballs in an hour.
   - In one hour, there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes each.
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so in one hour, \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs melt.
   - Therefore, the net number of snowballs made in one hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\).

2. **Calculate the time needed to make 60 snowballs:**
   - Since Jay makes 12 snowballs per hour, we need to find out how many hours it will take to make 60 snowballs.
   - The time required is \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of bandages used each day:**
   - On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages.
   - On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - On the third day, they used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.

2. **Calculate the total number of bandages used over the three days:**
   - Total bandages used = \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\)

3. **Determine the total number of bandages ordered:**
   - On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack, which is 50 bandages.
   - On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - Total bandages ordered = \(50 + 100 = 150\)

4. **Calculate the total number of bandages available at the end of the third day:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
   - Total bandages available at the end of the third day = \(x + 150 - 91\)

5. **Set up the equation based on the information given:**
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.
   - Therefore, \(x + 150 - 91 = 78\)

6. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - \(x + 59 = 78\)
   - \(x = 78 - 59\)
   - \(x = 19\)

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 19.

"To find out how many pens Alain has, we need to calculate the total number of red and black pens.

First, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, she bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs of black pens} \]

Each pack of black pens also has 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we add the total number of red and black pens to find the total number of pens Alain has:

"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which means he planted \(20 \times 2 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees planted on the second day is \(20 + 10 = 30\).

For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted \( \frac{1}{4} \) more than the 40 he planted on the first day. This means he planted an additional \(40 \times \frac{1}{4} = 10\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. Therefore, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is \(40 + 10 = 50\).

Now, we add up all the trees planted over the two days:
- White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.
3. Calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.**

The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
\[ \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches:
\[ \text{Total number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches per jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \]

**Step 4: Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans} \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was off by:
\[ 36 \]

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To find out how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of ground beef are needed for 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the number of pounds of ground beef.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds of meat he needs for 80 meatballs, we divide 80 by 16:

\[ \text{Pounds of meat needed} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. To find out how much seasoning he needs for 5 pounds of meat, we multiply 5 by 2:

\[ \text{Tablespoons of seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we know:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats.
   \[
   \text{Total treats} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Now, substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

Add 2 to both sides:
\[
4c = 12
\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[
c = 3
\]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem:
- Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.
- Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Samantha has 27 paintings.

So, we can write the equation for Samantha's paintings as:
\[ 27 = (K + 8) - 12 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 27 = K + 8 - 12 \]
\[ 27 = K - 4 \]

Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( K \):
\[ 27 + 4 = K \]
\[ 31 = K \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

Next, we need to find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right to pass. She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct:
\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \text{ questions} \]

Now, let's determine how many questions she got right on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:
\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \text{ questions} \]

To find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is 116:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Phineas Frog to travel half the distance on land and half the distance in water.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
3. **Distance in Water**: 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

Next, we calculate the time it takes to travel each segment:

- **Time on Land**: 
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}

"To find out how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in one week and then subtract that from the 300 pounds of feed Dexter ordered.

1. First, calculate the daily feed consumption for one pig:
   - Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
   - Daily consumption per pig = 4 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 8 pounds/day.

2. Next, calculate the total daily feed consumption for all five pigs:
   - Total daily consumption for 5 pigs = 8 pounds/day/pig * 5 pigs = 40 pounds/day.

3. Now, calculate the total feed consumption for one week (7 days):
   - Total weekly consumption = 40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds.

4. Finally, subtract the total weekly consumption from the 300 pounds of feed Dexter ordered:

   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour = \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \).

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Difference = Number of oranges Ana can peel - Number of oranges Jane can peel
   - Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"First, calculate the cost of the radiator after the 80% discount:

Original cost of the radiator: $400
Discount: 80% of $400 = 0.80 * $400 = $320
Cost after discount: $400 - $320 = $80

Next, calculate the cost for the mechanic to install the radiator:

Cost per hour: $50
Number of hours: 3
Total cost for labor: $50 * 3 = $150

Finally, add the cost of the radiator and the labor to find the total amount Mark paid:

Total cost: $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

We know the following:
- The total number of animals is 20:
  \[
  c + k = 20
  \]
- The total number of legs is 70:
  \[
  2c + 4k = 70
  \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
c + 2k = 35
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[
(c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
k = 15
\]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[
c + 15 = 20
\]
\[
c = 5
\]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas.
2. Divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry and his 3 friends, which makes 4 people in total).

First, we calculate the total number of slices:
7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:
56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

So, each person can have 14 slices.
