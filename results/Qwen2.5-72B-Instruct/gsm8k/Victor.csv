"To determine Josh's profit, we need to calculate the final value of the house after the repairs and then subtract the total cost (purchase price plus repair costs) from this value.

The value of the house increased by 150% due to the repairs. This means the value of the house after repairs is 250% of the original value (100% original value + 150% increase).

First, we calculate the 250% of the original value of the house:
250% of $80,000 = 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000

This is the new value of the house after the repairs. Now, we need to calculate the total cost Josh incurred:
Total cost = Purchase price + Repair costs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
Profit = New value of the house - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

So, Josh's profit is $70,000.

"James runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. To find the total meters he runs a week, we can multiply the number of sprints per session by the distance of each sprint and then multiply that by the number of sessions per week.

So, the calculation is:

3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint * 3 sessions/week

Now, let's do the math:

3 * 60 * 3 = 540 meters

James runs a total of 540 meters a week.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the day and then subtract the amount already given in the morning and afternoon meals.

Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily requirement is:
20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Wendi has already given:
15 cups in the morning + 25 cups in the afternoon = 40 cups

The amount of feed needed for the final meal is the total daily requirement minus what has already been given:
60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To calculate the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: every first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

We can pair the glasses into sets of two, with each set costing $5 (for the first glass) + $3 (for the second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find the number of pairs, which is 8 pairs.

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair to find the total cost:

8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) sheep.

Now, to find the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we add the number of sheep in each city:

\( 20 \) (Seattle) + \( 80 \) (Charleston) + \( 160 \) (Toulouse) = \( 260 \) sheep.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Carla to download the file, including the time lost due to the Windows update restart.

1. First, we calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file:
   40% of 200 GB is 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB.

2. Since Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is:
   80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

3. After the download is interrupted, Carla has to wait for the Windows update, which takes 20 minutes.

4. After the update, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, so she will download the full 200 GB again at the same rate of 2 GB/minute:
   200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

5. The total time to download the file, including the time lost to the update, is the sum of the time to download 40% of the file, the update time, and the time to download the full file again:
   40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Carla to download the file is 160 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance John travels in each segment of his trip and then determine how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

1. First, we calculate the distance John travels away from home:
   - He drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. Then, we calculate the distance John travels back home:
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles.
   - He drives for the next half-hour at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours total - 2 hours in traffic - 0.5 hours at 30 mph) at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.
   - Total distance traveled back home = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

3. Finally, we calculate how far he is from home:
   - Distance from home = Distance away from home - Distance back home
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours she worked.

Regular pay for the first 40 hours:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Overtime pay for the additional 5 hours:
5 hours * ($10/hour * 1.2) = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week:
$400 (regular pay) + $60 (overtime pay) = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

First month: 60 downloads
Second month: 3 times the first month, so 3 * 60 = 180 downloads
Third month: 30% reduction from the second month, so 180 - (0.30 * 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads

Now, we add the downloads from all three months together:
60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366 downloads

"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

For the donuts:
3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen would be 3 * $68 = $204

For the mini cupcakes:
2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen would be 2 * $80 = $160

For the mini cheesecakes:
6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen would be 6 * $55 = $330

Now, we add up the costs of all the pastries:
$204 (donuts) + $160 (mini cupcakes) + $330 (mini cheesecakes) = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then see how many years it will take for the cumulative net profit to cover the initial planting cost.

The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.

Each year, the tree will produce 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, so the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5

The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

The net profit per year is the annual revenue minus the annual cost:
$10.5 - $3 = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
$90 / $7.5 = 12

So, it will take 12 years for the net profit to cover the initial planting cost. However, at the end of the 12th year, the profit will just cover the cost, and he will start earning money after that. Therefore, Carlos will start earning money in the 13th year.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Melanie started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
3. After the green house, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.
6. After the orange house, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left, which we know is 5.

So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now we solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]
\[ 2x = 36 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance.
2. Subtract the number of contemporary dance students from the total to find the remaining students.
3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students.
4. Subtract the number of jazz dance students from the remaining students to find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
5. Calculate the percentage of the entire class that is enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Number of students in contemporary dance:
   20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

2. Remaining students after contemporary dance:
   20 students - 4 students = 16 students

3. Number of students in jazz dance:
   25% of the remaining 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

4. Remaining students after jazz dance (enrolled in hip-hop dance):
   16 students - 4 students = 12 students

5. Percentage of students in hip-hop dance:
   (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her weekly earnings from both jobs and then multiply by the number of weeks she works in a year.

First, we calculate her weekly earnings from teaching:
$20 per hour * 35 hours per week = $700 per week

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings from cheerleading coaching:
$30 per hour * 15 hours per week = $450 per week

Now, we add the two weekly earnings to find her total weekly salary:
$700 per week + $450 per week = $1150 per week

Finally, we multiply her total weekly salary by the number of weeks she works in a year to find her annual salary:
$1150 per week * 50 weeks per year = $57,500 per year

Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa should take to hike the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
2. Calculate the time Marissa has already spent hiking.
3. Determine the remaining time she has to complete the trail.
4. Calculate the speed required to cover the remaining distance in the remaining time.

Step 1: Total time to hike 12 miles at 4 miles per hour:
Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Step 2: Time already spent hiking:
Time for first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time for next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total time spent = 2 hours

Step 3: Remaining time to complete the trail:
Remaining time = Total time - Time already spent
Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours
Remaining time = 1 hour

Step 4: Distance remaining to be hiked:
Distance remaining = Total distance - Distance already hiked
Distance remaining = 12 miles - (4 miles + 2 miles)
Distance remaining = 12 miles - 6 miles
Distance remaining = 6 miles

Speed required for the remaining distance:
Speed required = Distance remaining / Remaining time
Speed required = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed required = 6 miles per hour

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trail.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in both the orange drink and the pineapple drink, and then sum them up after accounting for the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before the spill:
- The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in it is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in it is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract the water content of that 1 liter from the total water content of the orange drink:
- The amount of water in 1 liter of the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 \) liter.

Now, let's do the calculations:

Water in 10 liters of orange drink before spill:
\( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters

Water in 1 liter of orange drink spilled:
\( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \) liters

Water in 9 liters of orange drink after spill:
\( \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) liters

Water in 15 liters of pineapple drink:
\( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) liters

Total water in the remaining 24 liters (9 liters of orange drink + 15 liters of pineapple drink):
\( 6 + 9 = 15 \) liters

So, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age to find out how many years ago his son was born.

Step 1: Determine Raymond's current age.
Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before her, Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old.

Step 2: Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
Raymond had his son at the age of 23.

Step 3: Subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age.
Raymond is currently 37 years old, and he was 23 when his son was born, so 37 - 23 = 14 years ago.

Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought and subtract that from the total amount she paid. Then we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza.

The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. The total number of coins is 110:
   \( S + G = 110 \)

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
   \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):

\( S + (S + 30) = 110 \)
\( 2S + 30 = 110 \)
\( 2S = 110 - 30 \)
\( 2S = 80 \)
\( S = 40 \)

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

"To find out how many total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add them to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points and then add that to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So in the second 20 minutes, he scored:
4 points + 1 point = 5 points

Now, we add the points from both sessions to get the total points:
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

1. Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts eaten in 30 days.

Step 1: Number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 60 yogurts
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

So, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds, and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours given the time spent running and walking.

First, we know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run. Therefore, her running speed is twice her skipping speed:

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3 mph
Running speed = 6 mph

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can determine her walking speed:

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 mph / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 mph

Now, we need to calculate the time spent running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking over a total of six hours:

Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 hours
Time spent running = 2 hours

Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 hours
Time spent walking = 4 hours

Next, we calculate the distance traveled while running and walking:

Distance running = Running speed * Time spent running
Distance running = 6 mph * 2 hours
Distance running = 12 miles

Distance walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking
Distance walking = 1.5 mph * 4 hours
Distance walking = 6 miles

Finally, we add the distances together to get the total distance traveled:

Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking
Total distance = 12 miles + 6 miles
Total distance = 18 miles

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance. Her normal throwing distance is 400 feet, so with the gemstone, she can throw the javelin:

400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:

1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet

Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Calculate the number of calories per gram of chips.
3. Determine how many calories you have left to consume for the day.
4. Calculate how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.

Step 1: Total calories in the 300g bag
Since there are 5 servings in the bag and each serving has 250 calories, the total number of calories in the bag is:
5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories

Step 2: Calories per gram of chips
The bag is 300g, so the number of calories per gram is:
1250 calories / 300g = 4.1667 calories/gram

Step 3: Remaining calories for the day
You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories, so the remaining calories are:
2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Step 4: Grams of chips you can eat
To find out how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram:
200 calories / 4.1667 calories/gram ≈ 48 grams

So, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips.

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making the candles and the total revenue from selling them.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of beeswax are required to make 20 candles. Since 1 pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, we can calculate the pounds of beeswax needed as follows:

20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds of beeswax

Next, we calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks for 2 pounds:

2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00

Finally, we calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

$40.00 (revenue) - $20.00 (cost) = $20.00 (net profit)

"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write one article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which means:
2/5 * 5 = 2 more articles than Monday.
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which means:
2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, we can calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes and then bought a package with an unknown number of Post-it notes, which we'll call \( x \). She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left over. The total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is the sum of the Post-it notes she started with and the ones she bought. After using 220, she had 23 left, so the equation is:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 23 + 220 - 80 \]
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the package that Candice purchased contained 163 Post-it notes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:
   Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
   Number of blue ties = 5

2. Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, the number of red ties is:
   Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   Number of red ties = 2 * 5
   Number of red ties = 10

3. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is:
   Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + (50% of Cost per blue tie)
   Cost per red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
   Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
   Cost per red tie = $60

4. Now we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:
   Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
   Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
   Total spent on red ties = $600

5. Finally, we can find out the total amount spent on all ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:
   Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
   Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
   Total spent on ties = $800

So, the total amount John spent on ties is $800.

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Total number of units in the building
Total units = Number of floors * Units per floor
Total units = 15 floors * 8 units/floor
Total units = 120 units

Step 2: Number of occupied units
Occupied units = Total units * Occupancy rate
Occupied units = 120 units * 3/4
Occupied units = 90 units

Step 3: Number of unoccupied units
Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 units - 90 units
Unoccupied units = 30 units

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily income from selling the eggs.
3. Multiply the daily income by the number of days in a week to get the weekly income.

Step 1: Number of dozens of eggs produced per day
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozens per day

Step 2: Daily income from selling the eggs
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.
21 dozens * $2 per dozen = $42 per day

Step 3: Weekly income
There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily income by 7 to find the weekly income.
$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week

Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at a rate of 10 miles per hour and he sails for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance he covers is:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find out how long it takes him to travel back at a rate of 6 miles per hour, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

So, the time it takes to travel back is:

Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books that Uriah removes:

30 comic books * 1/4 pound per comic book = 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah still needs to remove more weight to reach the total of 15 pounds. Let's find out how much more weight he needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Next, we need to determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so:

7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound per toy) = 7.5 * 2 = 15 toys

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the revenue for both Thursday and Friday and then find the difference.

For Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each, so the revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires at $40 each, so the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
- The total revenue for Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

For Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each, so the revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
- There are no truck tires repaired, so the revenue from truck tires is $0.
- The total revenue for Friday is $480 + $0 = $480.

Now, we find the difference in revenue between the two days:
- The difference is $520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40.

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck. Then, we divide this remaining capacity by the weight of each box.

The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. The weight of each box is 15 pounds.

First, we calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge:

5000 pounds (bridge limit) - 3755 pounds (driver and truck) = 1245 pounds (remaining capacity)

Next, we determine how many boxes can be loaded:

1245 pounds (remaining capacity) / 15 pounds (per box) = 83 boxes

Since we can't load a fraction of a box, we take the integer part of the result, which is 83.

"If Marcy works for 30 years, she will have worked 10 years beyond the 20-year mark, which is the point at which she starts to become entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

For each of those 10 years, she earns an additional 5% of the $50,000 pension. So, we calculate the additional pension as follows:

10 years * 5% of $50,000 = 10 * 0.05 * $50,000 = 0.5 * $50,000 = $25,000

This $25,000 is the additional amount she will receive on top of the base $50,000 pension. Therefore, her total annual pension after 30 years of service will be:

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency and then use that to determine the total distance she can travel on a full tank.

First, we calculate the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) based on the information that she traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas:

Fuel efficiency (mpg) = Distance traveled (miles) / Amount of gas used (gallons)
Fuel efficiency (mpg) = 100 miles / 4 gallons
Fuel efficiency (mpg) = 25 mpg

Now that we know her car's fuel efficiency is 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate the total distance she can travel on a full tank of 12 gallons:

Total distance (miles) = Fuel efficiency (mpg) * Tank capacity (gallons)
Total distance (miles) = 25 mpg * 12 gallons
Total distance (miles) = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in that time and then divide by the number of cups per bag.

First, we need to know how many days are in a year. A standard year has 365 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food for the first 180 days is:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

For the remaining days of the year (365 - 180 = 185 days), the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food for the remaining 185 days is:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Each bag of dog food contains 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia will need, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 1/4 of what Sarah does.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.

First, we calculate how much laundry David does:
David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 pounds / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Next, we calculate how much laundry Raymond does:
Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 pounds / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

Now, we find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 pounds - 100 pounds
Difference = 100 pounds

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds.

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying the flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 with the cost of buying them in packages of 2 for $1.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
- 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
- 9 packages * $1.00 per package = $9.00

The difference in cost between the two options is:
- $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

So, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, which means each girl got:

24 liters * (1/6) = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of:

4 liters * 2 = 8 liters

The boy then got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:

8 liters + 6 liters = 14 liters

The total amount of water was 24 liters, so the amount of water left is:

24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters

10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers

Then he gave away 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 to decorate a greeting card, which means he gave away a total of:

9 + 28 = 37 stickers

Subtracting the stickers he gave away from the total he had, we get:

54 - 37 = 17 stickers

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

"To find the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we first need to calculate Alex's weight based on the information given.

Grace's weight is 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds to find Alex's weight:

4 * 125 - 2 = 500 - 2 = 498 pounds

Now, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight to find their combined weight:

"Let's denote the number of games won as W and the number of games lost as L. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

W + L = 22

It is also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us:

W = L + 8

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for L:

(L + 8) + L = 22
2L + 8 = 22
2L = 22 - 8
2L = 14
L = 14 / 2
L = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost (L), we can find the number of games won (W):

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

The team won 15 games.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to apply the 10% increase to her initial monthly salary of $600 for each of the three years following her 5-year mark.

First, let's calculate her monthly salary after the first 10% increase:
$600 + ($600 * 10%) = $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we apply the 10% increase for the second year:
$660 + ($660 * 10%) = $660 + $66 = $726

And for the third year:
$726 + ($726 * 10%) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Now, to find her annual salary, we multiply her final monthly salary by 12 (months in a year):
$798.60 * 12 = $9,583.20

Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $9,583.20.

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, which we can denote as \( 10H \).

The total number of copies sold by both is 88,000, so we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find the number of copies Harald sold, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To find out how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of guests that will actually show up by accounting for the 1/4 that don't show up.
2. Determine the number of gift bags needed based on the number of guests that will show up.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.

Step 1: Calculate the number of guests that will show up.
If 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, then 3/4 of the attendees will show up. So, we calculate 3/4 of 16 friends:
\( \frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12 \) guests will show up.

Step 2: Determine the number of gift bags needed.
Christina needs .75 gift bags per guest, so for 12 guests, she will need:
\( 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \) gift bags.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.
Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:
\( 9 \times 2 = 18 \) dollars.

Christina will spend 18 dollars on gift bags.

"To calculate the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to consider the amount that both the adult and child dinosaurs will eat.

Each adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad. With 20 adults, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is:
20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Each child dinosaur will eat half as much as an adult, which is 5 lbs of potato salad. With 5 children, the total amount of potato salad for the children is:
5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Adding the amounts for adults and children together gives us the total amount of potato salad needed:
200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles and then calculate his improved time after his diet change.

1. Let's denote Gerald's original time as \( G \) seconds.
2. Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's original time, so Lee's time is \( G - 2 \) seconds.
3. We are given that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation \( G - 2 = 38 \).
4. Solving for \( G \), we get \( G = 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds. This is Gerald's original time.
5. Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means his new time is 90% of his original time.
6. To find the new time, we calculate \( 0.90 \times 40 \) seconds.

Now, let's do the calculation:

\( 0.90 \times 40 = 36 \) seconds.

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that the number of dogs is 60.
2. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is 2 times the number of dogs. So, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.
3. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, the number of rabbits is (number of dogs + number of cats) - 12.
4. We can calculate the number of rabbits as (60 + 120) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168.
5. To find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits).

Now, let's calculate the total number of pets:

60 + 120 + 168 = 348

4. Subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the girl scout.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Number of boys = 2/5 of 200 students
   Number of boys = 2/5 * 200
   Number of boys = 80

2. Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
   Number of girls = 200 - 80
   Number of girls = 120

3. Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 of the number of girls
   Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120
   Number of girls in the girl scout = 80

4. Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
   Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80
   Number of girls not in the girl scout = 40

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to work backwards from the final volume of the sauce to the initial volume of the canned tomatoes, and then determine how many tomatoes that volume represents.

1. Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
2. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked into sauce, the original volume of the canned tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce.
3. Therefore, the original volume of the canned tomatoes is 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.
4. Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes.
5. To find out how many cans she used, we divide the total volume of the canned tomatoes by the volume of one can: 64 ounces / 16 ounces/can = 4 cans.
6. Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes.

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, after the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

The total number of cars that were originally on the motorway is 30. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, minus the 5 cars that took an exit.

The equation to represent this is:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 - 5 \]
\[ x + 15 = 25 \]
\[ x = 25 - 15 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, 10 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water Julia's boat took on while she was rowing back to shore.

First, we need to find out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. We can calculate the distance she rows in 64 seconds by setting up a proportion:

20 feet / 16 seconds = X feet / 64 seconds

Solving for X gives us the distance rowed in 64 seconds:

X = (20 feet * 64 seconds) / 16 seconds
X = (1280 feet*seconds) / 16 seconds
X = 80 feet

Now that we know Julia rowed 80 feet, we can calculate how much water the boat took on. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can set up another proportion to find out how much water was taken on over 80 feet:

2 liters / 10 feet = Y liters / 80 feet

Solving for Y gives us the amount of water taken on:

Y = (2 liters * 80 feet) / 10 feet
Y = (160 liters*feet) / 10 feet
Y = 16 liters

So, by the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to determine the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new increased price.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each: 10 * $10 = $100
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: 5 * $16 = $80

Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Next, we calculate the selling price of each type of board after the 50% price increase:

- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: $10 + ($10 * 50%) = $10 + $5 = $15 each
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: $16 + ($16 * 50%) = $16 + $8 = $24 each

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards:

- Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 * $15 = $150
- Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 * $24 = $120

Total revenue = $150 + $120 = $270

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many parts of the total mixture are sugar and how many are water, based on the given ratio of 7:13.

The total parts of the mixture are 7 (for sugar) + 13 (for water) = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to calculate the fraction of the total that is sugar and then apply that fraction to the total amount used.

The fraction of the total that is sugar is 7/20. To find the amount of sugar used, we multiply this fraction by the total amount:

(7/20) * 120 = 7 * (120/20) = 7 * 6 = 42

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many vehicles were added on the second day and then calculate how many containers that would represent, given that each container holds 5 vehicles.

On the first day, there were 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is:
2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
30 vehicles (total) - 10 vehicles (from the first day) = 20 vehicles

Since each container holds 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

The number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Add both salaries to get the total salary the two were receiving four years later.

Step 1: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. If Adrien's salary was $40,000, we can set up the equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + 0.30 * Lylah's salary
$40,000 = 1.30 * Lylah's salary

Now, we solve for Lylah's salary:

Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.30
Lylah's salary = $30,769.23 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what he was making four years ago. So we calculate:

Adrien's salary four years later = Adrien's salary four years ago + 40% of Adrien's salary four years ago
Adrien's salary four years later = $40,000 + 0.40 * $40,000
Adrien's salary four years later = $40,000 + $16,000
Adrien's salary four years later = $56,000

Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. We calculate:

Lylah's salary four years later = Lylah's salary four years ago + 40% of Lylah's salary four years ago
Lylah's salary four years later = $30,769.23 + 0.40 * $30,769.23
Lylah's salary four years later = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69
Lylah's salary four years later = $43,076.92 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 4: Add both salaries to get the total salary the two were receiving four years later.
Total salary = Adrien's salary four years later + Lylah's salary four years later
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,076.92
Total salary = $99,076.92

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92.

"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of sheets Miguel uses per week.
2. Calculate the number of weeks in a month.
3. Multiply the number of sheets used per week by the number of weeks in a month.

Step 1: Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets.
So, the number of sheets he uses per week is:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Step 2: The number of weeks in a month can vary, but for simplicity, we often use an average of 4 weeks per month.

Step 3: Now, we multiply the number of sheets used per week by the number of weeks in a month:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Determine the cost of a watermelon:
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Since each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

2. Determine the cost of an orange:
   - An orange costs $5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   - Since a watermelon costs $45, an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

3. Calculate the total cost for 4 watermelons:
   - 4 watermelons * $45 per watermelon = $180.

4. Calculate the total cost for 20 peppers:

"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost, and then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
- The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
- The revenue per patient is therefore $200 * 0.4 = $80.
- With 500 patients a day, the total revenue is $80 * 500 = $40,000.

Next, let's calculate the total cost:
- The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.
- The cost per patient is therefore $150 * 0.4 = $60.
- With 500 patients a day, the total cost is $60 * 500 = $30,000.

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
- Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits per day.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know that there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. We can subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total to find the number of semi-automatic cars.

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:

- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many babies as queens: \( B = 2Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the worker bees, baby bees, and queens:

\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

We can substitute the relationships into the equation:

\[ 2B + B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

To solve for \( B \), we first need to combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we can find a common denominator, which is 2:

\[ \frac{6B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

\[ \frac{7B}{2} = 700 \]

Now, we can solve for \( B \) by multiplying both sides by 2 and then dividing by 7:

\[ 7B = 1400 \]

\[ B = 200 \]

Now that we have the number of baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees:

\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.

"To calculate how much Shawnda made, we need to determine the total number of tires she inflated and then multiply that by the cost per tire.

Bicycles have 2 tires, so 5 people on bicycles would have 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
Tricycles have 3 tires, so 3 people on tricycles would have 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 person on a unicycle would have 1 * 1 = 1 tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total amount made is 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 500 cents is equal to 500 / 100 = 5 dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so in total, the pigeons ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
4. After the seagull and pigeons ate, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's denote the original number of fries as \( x \).

After Dave and the seagull ate, there were \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \) fries left.
After the pigeons ate, there were \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \) fries left.
The raccoon then stole two thirds of the remaining fries, so one third was left, which means \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \) fries were left after the raccoon.
After the ants carried off 1 fry, 5 fries were left, so before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.

Now we can set up the equation for the fries left after the raccoon:

\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x - 30 = 6 * 3 \]
\[ x - 30 = 18 \]
\[ x = 18 + 30 \]
\[ x = 48 \]

So, the original number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 48.

9 hours (MWF) + 8 hours (TTh) = 17 hours per week

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks:
17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours

Therefore, in one semester, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes.

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit, in this case, feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

First, we convert the length of the rolls from inches to feet:
- Each roll is 4 inches long, so 300 rolls will be 300 * 4 inches.
- 300 * 4 inches is 1200 inches.
- 1200 inches is 1200 / 12 = 100 feet.

Next, we convert the length of the chocolate croissants from inches to feet:
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, so 120 croissants will be 120 * 6 inches.
- 120 * 6 inches is 720 inches.
- 720 inches is 720 / 12 = 60 feet.

The baguettes are already given in feet:
- Each baguette is 2 feet long, so 60 baguettes will be 60 * 2 feet.
- 60 * 2 feet is 120 feet.

Now, we add up the total length of all the baked goods:
- Rolls: 100 feet
- Croissants: 60 feet
- Baguettes: 120 feet

Total length = 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet.

"To calculate the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to add up the monthly requirements for all the apes and then multiply by 2.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Total monthly requirement = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons)
Total monthly requirement = 700 bananas

For 2 months, the requirement would be:
2 months * 700 bananas/month = 1400 bananas

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then find the difference.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each back and forth is 200 yards (100 yards there and 100 yards back). So, Blake's total distance is:
15 times * 200 yards/time = 3000 yards

Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards there and 80 yards back, for a total of 160 yards per time. She does this 34 times. So, Kelly's total distance is:
200 yards (first run) + 34 times * 160 yards/time = 200 yards + 5440 yards = 5640 yards

Now, we find the difference between the distances run by Kelly and Blake:
5640 yards (Kelly) - 3000 yards (Blake) = 2640 yards

The winner runs 2640 yards farther than the loser.

"To find the tank's water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the changes in water depth from Monday to Tuesday and then from Tuesday to Wednesday.

1. On Monday, the depth of the water is 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the depth of the water is 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet.
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of the depth on Tuesday, which is 2/3 * 24 feet.

Now, let's calculate the depth for Wednesday:

2/3 * 24 feet = 16 feet

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find out how many fish Anakin and Locsin caught, we need to calculate the total for each of them and then add those totals together.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Now, let's add up the totals for each of them:

Anakin's total:
10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19 fish

Locsin's total:
5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13 fish

Combined total:
19 (Anakin's fish) + 13 (Locsin's fish) = 32 fish

So, the total number of fish they were able to catch is 32.

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the effect of the 20% price increase that occurs every two months over the 36-month period.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase over 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases

Each time the price increases, it is multiplied by 1 plus the percentage increase. A 20% increase is the same as multiplying by 1.20 (100% + 20% = 120% = 1.20).

So, the original price of $20 will be multiplied by 1.20, 18 times. We can express this as:

Final price = Original price * (1 + percentage increase) ^ number of increases
Final price = $20 * (1.20) ^ 18

Now, let's calculate the final price:

Final price = $20 * (1.20) ^ 18

Using a calculator to find (1.20) ^ 18:

(1.20) ^ 18 ≈ 38.3376

Now, multiply this by the original price:

Final price ≈ $20 * 38.3376
Final price ≈ $766.752

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is:

$766.75

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. The cost of one red car is $4, so the cost of 5 red cars is:
   5 red cars * $4/red car = $20

2. The cost of one action figure is $5, so the cost of 3 action figures is:
   3 action figures * $5/action figure = $15

3. The cost of the doll is the same as 3 action figures, which is:
   3 action figures * $5/action figure = $15

Now, we add up the costs of all the toys:
$20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the income she would lose by doing her taxes herself.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work at $35 per hour. The total lost income would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

The difference in cost between doing the taxes herself (in terms of lost income) and hiring the accountant is:

$105 (lost income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The cost of the CD burner is €74.
The cost of the printer is €102.

Let's add up the costs of the accessories and the computer:

1090 (computer) + 157 (scanner) + 74 (CD burner) + 102 (printer) = 1423

Now, we subtract this total from Elvira's budget:

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we can substitute \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B \]
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we can set up the equation based on the information given:

Let E represent the amount of money Ethel has. According to the problem, Ethel has $8, so E = 8.

Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, which can be represented as:

J = 2E + 2

Now we substitute the value of E into the equation:

J = 2 * 8 + 2
J = 16 + 2
J = 18

So, Jimmy has $18.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants, and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is given as $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
Jacket cost = 3 * Hat cost
Jacket cost = 3 * $25
Jacket cost = $75

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
Pants cost = (Hat cost + Jacket cost) / 2
Pants cost = ($25 + $75) / 2
Pants cost = $100 / 2
Pants cost = $50

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
Total cost = Hat cost + Jacket cost + Pants cost
Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50
Total cost = $150

"To find out how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time for peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

First, we calculate the time it takes to peel all the potatoes:
60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = 90 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cut all the potatoes:
60 potatoes * 5 seconds per potato = 300 seconds

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the cutting time to minutes:
300 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes

Now, we add the peeling time and the cutting time together to get the total time:
90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to first determine how many gallons of lemonade they sold to make a $25 profit.

Let's break down the costs and revenue:
- Cost per gallon for lemons: $3
- Cost per gallon for sugar: $2
- Total cost per gallon: $3 + $2 = $5
- Revenue per glass: $0.50
- Number of glasses per gallon: 20
- Revenue per gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10

Now, let's calculate the profit per gallon:
- Profit per gallon: Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5

To make a $25 profit, they would need to sell:
- Number of gallons to make $25 profit: $25 / $5 per gallon = 5 gallons

Since they need 5 gallons to make a $25 profit, the amount spent on lemons would be:
- Cost of lemons for 5 gallons: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

So, they spent $15 on lemons.

Now we can solve for \( W \):

\[ W = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Now, since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can calculate the number of red roses (\( R \)) as follows:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

First, we need to find out how old Mark was two years ago. Since Jan is 30 years old now, two years ago Jan was 28 years old. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14 years.

According to the second piece of information, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than 14, which means Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.

Now, to find out how old Mark is now, we add 2 years to his age from two years ago: 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time for the less well-rounded team is the sum of these times:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 seconds = 222 seconds

The difference in time between the two teams is:
222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds

The faster team (the well-rounded team) will win by 2 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
P(>3) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6. Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities:

P(even, even) = (3/6) * (3/6) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We can do this by dividing the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row and then converting the result to a percentage:

Likelihood ratio = P(>3) / P(even, even) = 0.5 / 0.25 = 2

This means that it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we subtract 1 (to find the increase) and then multiply by 100:

Percentage increase = (2 - 1) * 100 = 1 * 100 = 100%

So, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats, hamsters, and rabbits, and then use the information to determine the number of rats.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and rabbits:

- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total for the hamsters is 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw = 50 pieces of straw.
- There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw.

Now, let's add the straw given to the hamsters and rabbits:

50 pieces (hamsters) + 20 pieces (rabbits) = 70 pieces of straw.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed in total, we can subtract the straw given to the hamsters and rabbits to find out how much straw was given to the rats:

160 pieces (total) - 70 pieces (hamsters and rabbits) = 90 pieces of straw for the rats.

We know that each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so we can divide the total number of pieces of straw for the rats by the number of pieces each rat gets to find the total number of rats:

90 pieces (rats) / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can divide the total number of rats by the number of cages to find out how many rats are in each cage:

15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then use the profit to find the number of bags.

Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost of buying the bags is \( 20x \) dollars (since each bag costs $20).
The cost of transporting the bags is \( 2x \) dollars (since it costs $2 to transport each bag).

So, the total cost for the trader is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x \]

The revenue from selling the bags is \( 30x \) dollars (since each bag is sold for $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, and we know the profit is $400:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 400 = 30x - 22x \]
\[ 400 = 8x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks.
2. Divide the weekly total by 7 to find the daily requirement.

Step 1: Total weekly requirement for ten ducks
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, so for ten ducks:
3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Step 2: Daily requirement for ten ducks
There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the weekly total by 7 to find the daily requirement:
35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.
2. Over 10 years, the total increase in trees will be 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.
3. Tom starts with 50 trees, so after 10 years, before any trees die, he will have 50 + 80 = 130 trees.
4. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find out how many trees die, we calculate 30% of 130: 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.
5. The number of trees left after 30% die is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is:

"Let's break down the sequence of events to find out how many pink and white plastic flamingos are in Sue's front yard by noon on Sunday.

1. On Friday morning, there are 18 pink plastic flamingos.
2. On Saturday morning, the neighbors take back one third of the pink flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos.
3. These 6 flamingos are then painted white and put back out, so now there are 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.
4. On Sunday morning, the neighbors add another 18 pink plastic flamingos, so now there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and still 6 white flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos there are than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:

30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24

"To find out how much 8 pens will cost, we first need to determine the cost of one pen. We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. So, the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser is:

$1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

This means that one pen costs $1.50. Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

$1.50 * 8 = $12.00

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00.

"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants and then subtract that from the total amount of carrots available.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, so for 40 restaurants, the total amount of carrots distributed will be:

40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

We started with 200 pounds of carrots, so the amount of carrots that will not be used is:

200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, to find the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has, we add the initial number of cards to the cards collected in each of the three months:

20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the total earnings from both publishers.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers, we get:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"To calculate how much money John made that year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increased salary due to the 5% raise.

First, let's calculate the total amount of the one-time monetary reward:
One-time monetary reward = $5000

Next, let's calculate his new weekly salary after the 5% raise:
New weekly salary = Original weekly salary + (Original weekly salary * Raise percentage)
New weekly salary = $2000 + ($2000 * 0.05)
New weekly salary = $2000 + $100
New weekly salary = $2100

Now, let's calculate his total salary for the year:
Total salary for the year = New weekly salary * Number of weeks in a year
Total salary for the year = $2100 * 52
Total salary for the year = $109,200

Finally, let's add the one-time monetary reward to the total salary for the year to get the total amount of money John made that year:
Total money made = Total salary for the year + One-time monetary reward
Total money made = $109,200 + $5000
Total money made = $114,200

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the total for each meal and then sum them up.

For the sandwiches:
- He ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
- Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
- So, for sandwiches, he used 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices.

For the omelets:
- He ate omelets for breakfast 3 days.
- Each omelet used 1 more slice than each sandwich, so 2 slices + 1 slice = 3 slices per omelet.
- So, for omelets, he used 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

For the macaroni and cheese:
- He used 8 slices of cheese for the entire dish.

Now, we add up all the slices of cheese used:
- Sandwiches: 14 slices
- Omelets: 9 slices
- Macaroni and cheese: 8 slices

Total slices of cheese used = 14 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices = 31 slices.

"To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score from the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total points Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 over the five highest scores.
3. Calculate the sum of the four highest scores from the first five tests.
4. Determine the score needed on the sixth test to reach the total points required for an average of 93.

First, let's identify the lowest score from the first five tests:
The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the total points needed for an average of 93 over five tests:
Total points needed = 93 * 5 = 465

Now, we calculate the sum of the four highest scores from the first five tests:
Sum of four highest scores = 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Finally, we determine the score needed on the sixth test:
Score needed on sixth test = Total points needed - Sum of four highest scores
Score needed on sixth test = 465 - 367 = 98

Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to get an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To calculate the total kilometers Michael rode, we need to break it down into two parts: the first four weeks and the following three weeks.

For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides 4 * 125 = 500 kilometers.

For the following three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides 3 * 120 = 360 kilometers.

Adding the two parts together:
- Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g per chocolate bar = 1000g

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of a candied apple by dividing the weight of a chocolate bar by 2:
40g per chocolate bar / 2 = 20g per candied apple

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
80 candied apples * 20g per candied apple = 1600g

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000g (chocolate bars) + 1600g (candied apples) = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates.
2. Then, we will calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups.
3. Finally, we will determine the cost of each cup.

Step 1: The cost of one plate is $6000, so the cost of half a dozen (6) plates is:
6 * $6000 = $36000

Step 2: The total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
$36000 - $1200 = $34800

Step 3: Twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups:
$34800 / 240 = $145

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then determine how much more money she needs after accounting for her savings and babysitting earnings.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is:
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so the remaining amount she needs is:
$70 (total cost) - $10 (savings) = $60

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
4 * $5 = $20

Now, we subtract her babysitting earnings from the remaining amount she needs:
$60 (remaining amount) - $20 (babysitting earnings) = $40

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn mowed:
$40 / $4 = 10

Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

According to the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42, which is the sum of the eggs produced by the red and white chickens:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens:
\[ W = R + 2 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( R \):

\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle and then divide that by his walking speed.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
P = 2 * (length + width)

Given the dimensions of the park:
Length (L) = 6 miles
Width (W) = 1.5 miles

We can calculate the perimeter as follows:
P = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
P = 2 * 7.5
P = 15 miles

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours (T) he spends walking, we use the formula:
T = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values we have:
T = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
T = 5 hours

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day: 100 customers.
2. Determine the number of customers on the second day: 100 customers + 50 more = 150 customers.
3. Calculate the total number of customers for the first two days: 100 customers + 150 customers = 250 customers.
4. We know the total number of customers by the end of the third day is 500.
5. To find the number of customers on the third day, subtract the total of the first two days from the total by the end of the third day: 500 customers - 250 customers = 250 customers.

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons (since 16 gallons have leaked out in the last 4 minutes), and the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she owes, the total amount she will have paid, and then subtract the latter from the former.

First, we calculate the total amount Janeth owes, which is the principal plus the 10% interest:
Total amount owed = Principal + (Principal * Interest Rate)
Total amount owed = $2000 + ($2000 * 0.10)
Total amount owed = $2000 + $200
Total amount owed = $2200

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will have paid over 12 months:
Total amount paid = Monthly Payment * Number of Payments
Total amount paid = $165 * 12
Total amount paid = $1980

Finally, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount owed:
Remaining balance = Total amount owed - Total amount paid
Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980
Remaining balance = $220

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Adrian and Zack based on Harriet's current age.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years old.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so:
   Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so:
   Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Now, we need to calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
- Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
- Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages together and divide by 3:
Average age = (Harriet's age + Adrian's age + Zack's age) / 3
Average age = (24 + 66 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

After Ashlyn took the 36 watermelons, the remaining number of watermelons is:

120 - 36 = 84 watermelons

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest:

3/4 of 84 watermelons = 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons

After harvesting these 63 watermelons, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested is:

84 - 63 = 21 watermelons

"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. Cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000
2. Tax on the cars: 10% of $240,000 = $24,000
3. Registration fees: 12 cars * $1,000 per car = $12,000

Now, we add all these costs together to get the total amount Mark pays:

$240,000 (cost of cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000

$276,000"
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday.
2. Calculate how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday based on the information that she collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday.

Step 1: On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells, and Kylie collects 5 more than Robert. So, Kylie collects:
20 shells (Robert's collection) + 5 shells = 25 shells

Step 2: On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, she collects:
25 shells (Monday's collection) * 2 = 50 shells

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

"To find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we need to calculate the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number that went inside the cave to eat their dinner, and then subtract these from the total number of penguins.

One-third of the 36 penguins jump in and swim in the ocean:
1/3 * 36 = 12 penguins

Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner:
1/3 * 36 = 12 penguins

Now, we subtract the penguins that left from the total:
36 - 12 (swimming) - 12 (eating) = 12 penguins

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:

"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes he and his girlfriend will consume per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats:
6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats:
42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Together, they eat:
42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, if a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is:
63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet their weekly tomato consumption.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial pens Ram buys and the additional pens he can create by mixing the ink from the empty ones.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from the 25 empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
3. After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens, which he can again mix to make 1 more pen.
4. After using this 1 pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another pen since he needs 5 empty pens to make one new pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens plus the 1 additional pen he made.

25 (initial pens) + 5 (first batch of new pens) + 1 (second batch of new pens) = 31 pens

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we can start by determining the age of each girl based on the information provided.

Jessa's age is given as 20 years old.

Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is:
20 years (Jessa's age) + 5 years = 25 years

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is:
25 years (Joan's age) - 2 years = 23 years

Now, we can find the sum of their ages:
20 years (Jessa) + 25 years (Joan) + 23 years (Mary) = 68 years

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68 years.

"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the rest of the students.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of the students went out through exit A.
   30% of 1000 students = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students

Now, step 2:

2. The number of students remaining after exit A is:
   1000 students - 300 students = 700 students

Next, step 3:

3. 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B.
   3/5 of 700 students = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students

Finally, step 4:

4. The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students:
   700 students - 420 students = 280 students

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that John has 54 candies.
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.
3. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.
4. To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: 54 - 33 = 21.

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of pen pals Mike is still in contact with.
2. Calculate the total number of letters he receives each week.
3. Calculate the total number of pages he needs to write in response.
4. Determine the total time he spends writing those pages.
5. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Mike was a pen pal with 5 people and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is still in contact with:
5 - 2 = 3 people

Step 2: Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, so the total number of letters he receives each week is:
3 * 2 = 6 letters

Step 3: Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he needs to write in response is:
6 * 5 = 30 pages

Step 4: Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing those pages is:
30 * 6 = 180 minutes

Step 5: To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
180 / 60 = 3 hours

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week.

"To calculate the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan, we need to consider the following:

1. Jason's phone plan includes 1000 minutes per month.
2. He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes spent on these calls is 15 minutes/day * 30 days.
3. He has also used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people.

Let's calculate the total minutes used and then subtract that from the 1000 minutes included in his plan.

Total minutes used for calls with his boss: 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes
Total minutes used for calls to other people: 300 minutes

Total minutes used: 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan for the month.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin has 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes 2 * 5 = 10 fries from Griffin. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle took, so Colby takes 5 - 3 = 2 fries from Griffin. Now Griffin has 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.
5. Ginger gives Griffin some fries, and after that, Griffin has 27 fries.

To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to calculate the difference between the number of fries Griffin had after Colby took some and the number of fries Griffin had at the end.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since there are the same number of fish in each aquarium, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

So we can write the equation as:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the number of cookies each of them ate and then convert that into calories.

First, let's calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on each day:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:

- Sue's total cookies: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.
- Her sister's total cookies: 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Next, we convert the number of cookies into calories:

- Sue's total calories: 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories.
- Her sister's total calories: 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories.

Finally, we find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total number of students in the school:
   3 classes * 20 students/class = 60 students

2. Total number of girls in the school (50% of the total students):
   60 students * 50% = 30 girls

3. Number of girls in the third class:
   30 girls (total) - 15 girls (first class) - 12 girls (second class) = 3 girls (third class)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
2. Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
3. Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, which means he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, we can find out how many wolves Rick killed today. Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and he killed 12 cougars, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves today.

Now we can add up all the animals Rick killed:

- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals

Total animals killed: 25 + 48 = 73

First, we calculate 30% of Mitchel's 30 slides:
30% of 30 = 0.30 * 30 = 9

Now, we subtract that from Mitchel's total to find Anne's total:
Anne's slides = Mitchel's slides - 30% of Mitchel's slides
Anne's slides = 30 - 9 = 21

Now that we know Anne went down the slide 21 times, we can calculate how many times Robert went down the slide, which is 4 times as much as Anne:
Robert's slides = 4 * Anne's slides
Robert's slides = 4 * 21 = 84

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by termites from the total weight to find the remaining weight.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree.
- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- There are 200 / 10 = 20 sections in the tree.
- The total weight of the tree is 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

Step 2: Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
- The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
4. Andrea has 52 apples.

From point 1, we can write the equation for the number of apples Jamal has as:
A = J + 8
where A is the number of apples Andrea has and J is the number of apples Jamal has.

Since we know Andrea has 52 apples, we can substitute A with 52:
52 = J + 8

Solving for J, we get:
J = 52 - 8
J = 44

So, Jamal has 44 apples.

From point 3, we can write the equation for the number of bananas Jamal has as:
B = J + 4
where B is the number of bananas Jamal has.

Substituting J with 44, we get:
B = 44 + 4
B = 48

So, Jamal has 48 bananas.

From point 2, we can write the equation for the number of bananas Andrea has as:
A_b = B / 2
where A_b is the number of bananas Andrea has.

Substituting B with 48, we get:
A_b = 48 / 2
A_b = 24

So, Andrea has 24 bananas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have:
Total fruits = A + J + A_b + B
Total fruits = 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas)
Total fruits = 52 + 44 + 24 + 48

"To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then subtract her budget from this total cost.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

The total cost of the house is the sum of the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee:
Total cost = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total cost = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000
Total cost = $409,500

Now, we subtract Mrs. Cruz's budget from the total cost to find out how much more the house costs:
Amount over budget = Total cost - Budget
Amount over budget = $409,500 - $400,000
Amount over budget = $9,500

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

3. Time to cook the chicken: 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil to 400 degrees.

Let's calculate the time for each step:

1. Time to heat oil to 300 degrees: 20 minutes.
2. Time to heat oil from 300 to 400 degrees: 20 minutes * 40% = 8 minutes. So, the total time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes.
3. Total time to warm up the oil to 400 degrees: 20 minutes + 28 minutes = 48 minutes.
4. Time to cook the chicken: 48 minutes - 5 minutes = 43 minutes.

Now, we add the time to warm up the oil and the time to cook the chicken to get the total time:

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary has, we need to add the number of M&Ms in each of the three bags.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add the M&Ms from all three bags together:
300 (first bag) + 312 (second bag) + 150 (third bag) = 762 M&Ms.

"To find the total number of windows in both houses, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house, and then sum these amounts for both houses.

First, we calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, each house has 3 bedrooms * 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows in the bedrooms.

Next, we add the additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.
- Therefore, each house has 6 windows in the bedrooms + 4 additional windows = 10 windows in total.

Since John has 2 houses, we multiply the total number of windows in one house by 2:
- 2 houses * 10 windows/house = 20 windows in total.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we can start by calculating the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then subtracting these from the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches for the two sleeves combined. After that, we can divide by two to find the number of stitches for each sleeve.

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches:
Collar stitches = 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar:
Rosette stitches = 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches

The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can now subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette to find the number of stitches for the two sleeves:
Sleeves stitches (both) = 1800 stitches - (900 stitches + 90 stitches + 180 stitches)
Sleeves stitches (both) = 1800 stitches - 1170 stitches
Sleeves stitches (both) = 630 stitches

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of sleeve stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve:
Sleeve stitches (each) = 630 stitches / 2 = 315 stitches

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part of his role and then sum them up.

1. The solo song has 54 lines, and all of them are his to memorize.
2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines in total. However, only a third of these lines are his, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.
3. The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines in total. Four-fifths of these lines are his, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up all the lines he has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines to memorize: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138

"To find out how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the total time for each type of hole and then convert the total time into hours.

First, we calculate the time for the small holes:
30 small holes * 3 minutes per small hole = 90 minutes

Next, we calculate the time for the large holes:
15 large holes * 10 minutes per large hole = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for both small and large holes:
90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, we convert the total minutes into hours:
240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 years to each of their current ages and then sum those future ages.

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as K. According to the information provided:

M + K = 20

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be K + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

(M + 10) + (K + 10) = M + K + 20

Since we know that M + K = 20, we can substitute this into the equation:

20 + 20 = 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ R = 6S \]

In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now we can substitute the value of \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the equation, we get:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

Let the number of spots on a mamba be \( x \).
Then the number of spots on a cobra is \( 2x \).

We know that a cobra has 70 spots, so:
\( 2x = 70 \)
\( x = 70 / 2 \)
\( x = 35 \)

So, a mamba has 35 spots.

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park:

Total spots on cobras = number of cobras * spots per cobra
Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70
Total spots on cobras = 2800

Total spots on mambas = number of mambas * spots per mamba
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35
Total spots on mambas = 2100

Now, we add the total spots of cobras and mambas to get the combined total spots:
Total spots combined = total spots on cobras + total spots on mambas
Total spots combined = 2800 + 2100
Total spots combined = 4900

Finally, we need to find half the number of spots they all have combined:
Half the number of spots = total spots combined / 2
Half the number of spots = 4900 / 2
Half the number of spots = 2450

"To find out how many dollars Maddy will spend on pizza, we need to calculate the total number of people, the number of pizzas required, and then the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total number of people:
- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
- There are 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:
- 39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost:
- 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

So, Maddy will spend $195 on pizza.

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then determine how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the length available for the sterling silver beads is:
25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (topaz gemstones) = 17 inches

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of sterling silver beads that can fit into the 17 inches is:
17 inches / (1/4 inch/bead) = 17 * 4 beads = 68 beads

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

- Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories
- Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories

Now, let's add the stories from both weeks for each of them:
- Alani's total: 20 (first week) + 40 (second week) = 60 stories
- Braylen's total: 40 (first week) + 80 (second week) = 120 stories
- Margot's total: 60 (first week) + 120 (second week) = 180 stories

"To find the number of 5-star rows, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows, and then subtract that from the total number of stars to find out how many are in the 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars, so:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars, so:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Adding the stars from the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows gives us:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The total number of stars on the flag is 76, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones and then divide that by the weight capacity of one truck.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds each. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of one truck:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Since you can't have a fraction of a truck, and the result is a whole number, we need exactly 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles. We know the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

The formula to calculate time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the slow lane, the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles per hour. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has.
2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
3. Use the information that their combined total is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out to find the total number of medals.

Step 1: Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has:
22 (Ali's medals) - 5 = 17 medals

Step 2: The total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is:
22 (Ali's medals) + 17 (Izzy's medals) = 39 medals

Step 3: Since their combined total is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out, we can set up the equation:
39 * 10 = Total number of medals given out

Now we can calculate the total number of medals given out:
39 * 10 = 390

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

Now, in the fourth round, each player who has over 20 points gets an extra point:

- Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point: 18 points.
- Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: 42 + 1 = 43 points.

"To calculate the total cost John pays for the driving service per year, we need to consider both the mileage cost and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- John's work is 30 miles away, so a round trip is 60 miles.
- He goes to work 5 days a week, so in a week, he travels 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.
- Over 50 weeks, he travels 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.
- At a rate of $2 per mile, the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000/year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the monthly bonus:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus per year is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

Now, let's add the two costs together to get the total annual cost:
- Total cost for miles driven: $30,000/year
- Total cost for monthly bonuses: $1,800/year
- Total annual cost: $30,000/year + $1,800/year = $31,800/year

Therefore, John pays $31,800 a year for the driving service.

Therefore, a single sheet of paper will contain pages 1 and 2 on one side, and pages 31 and 32 on the other side when unfolded. Since the tabloid has 32 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages per sheet:

32 pages / 4 pages per sheet = 8 sheets

So, 8 pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid.

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to determine how many books she sold in that year. We can do this by first figuring out how many books she sold in the first and third years.

We know the following:
- There are 250 books in total.
- There are 50 unsold books.
- She sold 45 books in the third year.
- She sold twice as many books in the first year as in the third year.

Let's calculate the number of books sold in the first year:
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold in the third year
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * 45
- Books sold in the first year = 90

Now, let's calculate the total number of books sold:
- Total books sold = Total books - Unsold books
- Total books sold = 250 - 50
- Total books sold = 200

Next, we can find out how many books were sold in the second year by subtracting the books sold in the first and third years from the total books sold:
- Books sold in the second year = Total books sold - (Books sold in the first year + Books sold in the third year)
- Books sold in the second year = 200 - (90 + 45)
- Books sold in the second year = 200 - 135
- Books sold in the second year = 65

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year by multiplying the number of books sold in the second year by the price per book:
- Money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
- Money earned in the second year = 65 * 20

- He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from the hourly wage are 50 * $10 = $500.

Next, let's add the weekly bonus:
- Since the company performed well, he gets a $300 bonus each week.

Now, let's calculate his total weekly earnings:
- His total weekly earnings are $500 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800.

April typically has 4 weeks, so we will calculate his earnings for 4 weeks:

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves are sold in the morning.
   \( \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \) loaves

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) loaves

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon:
   Half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold in the afternoon.
   \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) loaves

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week and then calculate how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, given that she needs 4 weeks to lose what Joey loses in one week.

First, we find out how much weight Joey loses in one week:
Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in one week, Joey loses:
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in one week). To lose 8 pounds, which is Joey's 4-week total, we calculate how many weeks it will take Sandy:
8 pounds / (2 pounds / 4 weeks) = 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds per week = 16 weeks

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"To calculate the total savings, we need to determine the savings on the ice cream and the milk separately and then add them together.

For the ice cream:
- Original price per tub: $13
- Discounted price per tub: $11
- Savings per tub: $13 - $11 = $2
- Total savings for 2 tubs: 2 * $2 = $4

For the milk:
- Discount per packet: $0.5
- Total savings for 4 packets: 4 * $0.5 = $2

Total savings for both items:
- Total savings: $4 (ice cream) + $2 (milk) = $6

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum for fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs separately and then add them together.

An extra arm grows every 3 days, so in 15 days, the number of new arms will be:
15 days / 3 days per arm = 5 new arms

An extra leg grows every 5 days, so in 15 days, the number of new legs will be:
15 days / 5 days per leg = 3 new legs

Adding the new arms and legs together gives us the total number of new limbs:
5 new arms + 3 new legs = 8 new limbs

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, the cost of the flight ticket:
$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

The total amount spent on suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket is:
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he has left to spend on gifts after buying the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket, and setting aside the savings is:
$6000 - $1950 - $2000 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

"To calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to first determine the daily egg consumption and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

There are three people who eat three eggs each day, and two people who eat two eggs each day.

The three people will consume:
3 people * 3 eggs/person/day = 9 eggs/day

The two people will consume:
2 people * 2 eggs/person/day = 4 eggs/day

The total daily consumption is:
9 eggs/day + 4 eggs/day = 13 eggs/day

Now, to find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs/week

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
4. If Noah was 20 years old six years ago, then Noah is currently 20 + 6 = 26 years old.
5. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time, so the population was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.
6. Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now, so the current population is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense, which we can denote as \( 2D \), and half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, which we can denote as \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

To combine the terms, we need a common denominator, which is 2:

\[ \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{1D}{2} = 105 \]

\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 and then divide by 7:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find out how many people show up for Martha's party, let's break down the information:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, which is 2 * 6 = 12 people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, which is 3 * 4 = 12 people.
- In total, she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.
- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is 8 (illness) + 2 (commitments) = 10 people.

Therefore, the number of people who show up for the party is the total number of people invited minus the number of people who couldn't come:

24 (invited) - 10 (couldn't come) = 14 people.

"To find the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after buying from Johanna and receiving more from his father.
2. Multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to get the total weight.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles.
- Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
- He already had 50 marbles in the store.
- His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

So, the total number of marbles Solomon has is:
20 (from Johanna) + 50 (already in the store) + 8 (from his father) = 78 marbles.

Step 2: Calculate the total weight.
- Each marble weighs 2kgs.
- The total weight is 78 marbles * 2kgs/marble = 156kgs.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular pool is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length \( l = 6 \) feet
- Width \( w = 4 \) feet
- Depth \( d = 5 \) feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]
\[ V = 24 \times 5 \]
\[ V = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 \]
\[ C = 12 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12.

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls and nongendered children based on the number of boys, and then add all the numbers together.

Given:
- The classroom has 30 boys.
- There are 3 times as many girls as boys.
- There are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys.

Let's calculate the number of girls:
Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

Now, let's calculate the number of nongendered children:
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 of 40 people left the party. That's 40 / 4 = 10 people who left.

If 22 men stayed at the party, that means 25 (initial number of men) - 22 (men who stayed) = 3 men left the party.

Since 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men, the remaining 10 - 3 = 7 people who left must have been women.

Initially, there were 15 women, so the number of women left at the party is 15 (initial number of women) - 7 (women who left) = 8 women.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes and then calculate the total number of boxes needed for both Jam and Meg's pencils.

First, let's find out how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the following equation to find the number of pencils in each box:

3 * (number of pencils in each box) + 2 loose pencils = 26 pencils

Let's solve for the number of pencils in each box:

3 * (number of pencils in each box) = 26 - 2
3 * (number of pencils in each box) = 24
(number of pencils in each box) = 24 / 3
(number of pencils in each box) = 8

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find out how many boxes are needed for all of Jam's pencils:

Jam's pencils / pencils per box = 26 / 8
This is 3 full boxes and 2 loose pencils, which means Jam still needs 3 boxes for her pencils.

Next, we need to determine how many boxes Meg needs for her 46 pencils:

Meg's pencils / pencils per box = 46 / 8
This is 5 full boxes and 6 loose pencils, which means Meg needs 5 boxes and an additional box for the 6 loose pencils, totaling 6 boxes.

Finally, we add the number of boxes needed for both Jam and Meg:

Jam's boxes + Meg's boxes = 3 + 6 = 9

So, Jam and Meg need a total of 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To find out how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total amount of liquid added to the coffee, which includes both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, we determine how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes:

65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters per ice cube = 60 milliliters weaker

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. So, the total amount by which the coffee is weakened is:

60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of junior programmers.
2. Calculate the number of senior programmers.
3. Calculate the monthly pay for a senior programmer.
4. Calculate the total monthly pay for all junior programmers.
5. Calculate the total monthly pay for all senior programmers.
6. Add the total monthly pay for junior and senior programmers to get the total amount paid to all programmers.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. Since the company has 100 employees, the number of junior programmers is:
   \( \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \)

2. The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers:
   \( \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \)

3. The monthly pay for a senior programmer is $400 more than a junior programmer, who is paid $2000 per month:
   \( \text{Monthly pay for a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \)

4. The total monthly pay for all junior programmers is:
   \( \text{Total pay for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \)

5. The total monthly pay for all senior programmers is:
   \( \text{Total pay for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \)

6. The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:
   \( \text{Total pay for all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \)

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got in, so the number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

We know that after the second stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus heading to the third stop. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = 20 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 5 - 7 + 8 = 20 \]
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"To calculate how long it will take to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we need to determine the remaining percentage of charge required and then convert that into time based on the given rate of charging.

The phone needs to be charged from 60% to 100%, which is a difference of 40 percentage points.

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to charge 40 percentage points, it will take:

40 percentage points * 3 minutes/percentage point = 120 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 before any discounts. They used their $4 in rewards, and the coupon they applied took twice the amount of the rewards off the price.

Coupon discount = 2 * $4 = $8

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied to the $43 purchase:

Total discount = Rewards + Coupon discount
Total discount = $4 + $8 = $12

Finally, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent to find out how much the customer paid:

Amount paid = $43 - $12 = $31

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows Farmer Brown has, and then calculate the total number of legs.

Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( Ch \).

According to the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of animals is 60, so \( C + Ch = 60 \).
2. There are twice as many chickens as cows, so \( Ch = 2C \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( C \):
\( C + 2C = 60 \)
\( 3C = 60 \)
\( C = 20 \)

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\( Ch = 2C \)

\( 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \) meters

Step 3: Total distance for June
June has 30 days, so we multiply the new daily distance by 30:
\( 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \) meters

The total distance Tyson covered in June is:
180000"
"Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. 

Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

"To calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs for each type of table and then add the two results together.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the two totals together:
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310.

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in the bag.

Jenny's son gets 4 cookies a day for 5 days a week, so he eats:
4 cookies/day * 5 days/week = 20 cookies/week

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days a week, so he eats:
1 cookie/day * 7 days/week = 7 cookies/week

Together, they eat:
20 cookies/week (son) + 7 cookies/week (husband) = 27 cookies/week

The bag has 36 cookies, so the number of cookies Jenny eats is:
36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies

Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts with a 40% discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the shirts without the discount. Then we apply the discount to find the final price.

The cost of one shirt is $30, so the cost of two shirts is:
2 * $30 = $60

The discount is 40%, so the discount amount on the total cost is:
40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final price:
$60 - $24 = $36

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"To find out what percentage more the factory is making per day now compared to when they made tractors, we need to calculate the daily revenue for both tractors and silos, and then find the percentage increase.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue when they made tractors:
10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

Now, let's calculate the daily revenue for silos:
5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

Next, we find the difference in daily revenue:
$1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original daily revenue (when they made tractors) and multiply by 100:
($100/day / $1000/day) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

"To calculate the total amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to add up the monthly costs and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

First, let's calculate the monthly cost of food:
- Food costs $25 per week.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- So, the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100.

Next, we have the cost of treats, which is $20 per month.

Then, the cost of medicine is $100 per month.

Now, let's add up the monthly costs:
- Monthly cost of food: $100
- Monthly cost of treats: $20
- Monthly cost of medicine: $100
- Total monthly cost: $100 + $20 + $100 = $220

Finally, to find the yearly cost, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12:
- Yearly cost: $220 * 12 = $2640

So, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year.

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she donates and then subtract that from the number of plant pots she originally bought.

The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. This means they asked for:
- 30 plant pots for the daisies
- 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses

The total number of plant pots the school asked for is:
30 (daisies) + 60 (roses) = 90 plant pots

April had already bought 100 plant pots. After donating the 90 plant pots to the school, she has:
100 - 90 = 10 plant pots left over

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first determine the total time he spent on vacation. We know that the time he spent watching shows (3 shows * 2 hours each) and the time he spent boating and swimming is 30% of his total vacation time.

Let's calculate the time spent on these activities:
- Time spent boating: 6 hours
- Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
- Time spent watching shows: 3 * 2 = 6 hours

Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:
6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (shows) = 15 hours

This 15 hours is 30% of his total vacation time. We can set up the equation to find the total vacation time (T):
15 hours = 0.30 * T

Now we solve for T:
T = 15 hours / 0.30
T = 50 hours

Now that we know the total vacation time, we can find out how much time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of his total vacation time:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.40 * T
Time spent sightseeing = 0.40 * 50 hours
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

"To find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add that to her current savings. Then we subtract that total from the cost of the phone.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job:
$10 per hour * 20 hours = $200

Next, her earnings from the second job:
$5 per hour * 15 hours = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs:
$200 + $75 = $275

We add her current savings to her total earnings:
$80 + $275 = $355

Finally, we subtract this total from the cost of the phone to find out how much more she needs to save:
$400 - $355 = $45

So, Annabelle still needs to save $45.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The height of the shortest tree is 6 feet.
2. The height of the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.
3. The combined height of the shortest and second tree is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.
4. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and second tree, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears that Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
6 * $2 = $12

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
5 * $1 = $5

The total cost of the toys is:
$12 + $5 = $17

Dean initially had $28 and spent $17, so he has:
$28 - $17 = $11

After his mother gives him an extra $10, Dean has:
$11 + $10 = $21

So, the final amount of money Dean has left is:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for one person (Morgan) to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then we can see how many people can be accommodated within the $90 budget.

The cost for one person is:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts (2 rides): $10 * 2 = $20

Total cost for one person: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, we need to see how many people can be accommodated with the $90 budget. Since Morgan is also part of the group, we need to include her in the count.

$90 / $30 = 3

This means that the budget can cover the costs for 3 people, which includes Morgan and 2 friends.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Billy starts with $10.
2. He buys candy at $1.5 per pound.
3. After buying the candy, he has some change left.
4. He spends half of his change on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each.
5. He bought 40 gumballs.

First, we need to find out how much money Billy spent on the gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40, we can calculate the total cost of the gumballs:

40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.00

Since this $2.00 is half of his change, his total change must have been:

$2.00 * 2 = $4.00

Now we know that after buying the candy, Billy had $4.00 left. This means he spent:

$10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00 on candy.

To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount he spent on candy by the cost per pound:

$6.00 / $1.5/pound = 4 pounds

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 2x = 45 + 5 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities, then multiply that by the number of trips it makes in a day, and finally determine how many days it can operate before reaching the 18,000-mile service interval.

1. Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:
   The combined distance from the first to the second and then to the third city is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.
   The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than 175 miles, which is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

2. Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:
   The total distance for one trip is the sum of the distances between all three cities: 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

3. Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:
   Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is 300 miles * 3 = 900 miles.

4. Calculate the number of days before service is needed:
   The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so we divide 18,000 miles by the daily distance to find out how many days it can go without service: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

The train goes 20 days between services.

"To find out how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to determine the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. Since a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed, we can calculate it as follows:

Average stuffing for a collie bed = (Stuffing for a Rottweiler bed + Stuffing for a chihuahua bed) / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 pounds + 2 pounds) / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = 10 pounds / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = 5 pounds

Now we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:

Total stuffing for chihuahua beds = 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed
Total stuffing for chihuahua beds = 8 pounds

Total stuffing for collie beds = 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed
Total stuffing for collie beds = 15 pounds

Total stuffing needed = Total stuffing for chihuahua beds + Total stuffing for collie beds
Total stuffing needed = 8 pounds + 15 pounds
Total stuffing needed = 23 pounds

   - The original distance is 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles, making the total distance 210 miles.
   - He drives at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

2. For the trip back home:
   - The distance is 240 miles.
   - He drives at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Now, we add the time for both trips to get the total time:
Total time = Time to friend's house + Time back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

96 (total students) - 43 (girls) = 53 boys

On Friday, 4 boys were absent. So, the number of boys present at school on Friday is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks be \( x \).
2. According to the problem, \( x = 3 \) (since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks).
3. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4x - 5 \).
4. The number of people kicked out for physical violence is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters, which is \( 3(4x - 5) \).
5. The total number of people kicked out is 50.

We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) + \text{other reasons} = 50 \]

Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the equation:

\[ 3 + (4 \cdot 3 - 5) + 3(4 \cdot 3 - 5) + \text{other reasons} = 50 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3 + (12 - 5) + 3(12 - 5) + \text{other reasons} = 50 \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 3 \cdot 7 + \text{other reasons} = 50 \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 + \text{other reasons} = 50 \]
\[ 31 + \text{other reasons} = 50 \]

Now, solve for the number of people kicked out for other reasons:

\[ \text{other reasons} = 50 - 31 \]
\[ \text{other reasons} = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19.

We know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Sara has 8 points, so three times more than Sara's points would be:

3 * 8 = 24

This means Erin has 24 points after scoring the additional 14 points. To find out how many points Erin had before, we subtract the 14 points she scored:

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples she picked each day and then sum them up.

First, we know that Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday for $56. Since she sells apples at $4 each, we can calculate the number of apples she sold on Monday by dividing the total money made by the price per apple:

Number of apples sold on Monday = Total money made / Price per apple
Number of apples sold on Monday = $56 / $4
Number of apples sold on Monday = 14

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, so:

Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples picked on Tuesday
Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * 12
Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 24

Now, we can sum up the apples picked over the three days:

Total apples picked = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday
Total apples picked = 14 + 12 + 24

"To calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to determine the total amount she will owe after the five months, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, we calculate the interest for the five months. The annual interest rate is 10%, so the monthly interest rate is 10% divided by 12 months, which is 0.8333% per month.

The formula to calculate the total interest for a simple interest loan is:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- Principal is the amount borrowed ($3,650),
- Rate is the monthly interest rate (0.8333% or 0.008333 as a decimal),
- Time is the duration in months (5 months).

Let's calculate the total interest:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.008333 \times 5 \]

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.041665 \]

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 152.49425 \]

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to get the total amount to be repaid:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.49425 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.49425 \]

Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.49425}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.49885 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.50 \]

4. Divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade to find the profit per hour.

Let's go through each step:

1. Millie can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups is:
   3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

2. If she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is:
   36 cups * $1/cup = $36

3. The cost of the supplies is $18, so the total profit is:
   $36 (total revenue) - $18 (cost of supplies) = $18

4. Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how many hours it will take to sell all 36 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour:
   36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

5. Finally, to find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours:
   $18 (total profit) / 9 hours = $2/hour

So, Millie will make a profit of $2 per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first. He sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. According to the problem, the amount of land left is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write:

\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we can solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing, and half of them can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

Number of girls performing = 26 / 2 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them, so we add them to the number of girls performing:

Total number of people performing = Number of girls performing + Number of teachers
Total number of people performing = 13 + 3 = 16

Therefore, the number of people who sang in the performance is 16.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we first need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate this by dividing the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson by 3.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 66 / 3 = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha, who buys individual ride tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets.
- Each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs 2 tickets * $2/ticket = $4.
- For 9 rides, Dasha will pay 9 rides * $4/ride = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives access to all 9 rides.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the cost of buying individual tickets for 9 rides:
- Savings = Cost of 9 individual tickets - Cost of the ride bracelet
- Savings = $36 - $30
- Savings = $6

David saves $6.

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we can start by setting up the ratio and the total number of popsicles in terms of a variable. Let's say the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x, where x is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of the popsicles that Betty and Sam have, which is given as 165. So we can write the equation:

5x + 6x = 165

Combining like terms, we get:

11x = 165

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 165 / 11
x = 15

Now that we have the value of x, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:

Betty has 5x popsicles, which is 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6x popsicles, which is 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

90 - 75 = 15

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To calculate the savings, we need to determine the total cost of the streaming services and then subtract that from the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10 a month, but with a 20% discount for bundling.

The discount on Hulu and Disney Plus is 20% of $20 (since each service is $10 and he has two of them):

20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

So, the total cost for Hulu and Disney Plus with the discount is:

$20 - $4 = $16

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:

$10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26

The total cost of the streaming services is $26 a month.

Now, let's calculate the savings by cancelling the $60 cable package:

$60 (cable) - $26 (streaming services) = $34

So, Tim saves $34 a month by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services.

"To find the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time spent recording the song, which is half the time spent writing it.
2. Convert all times to the same unit (minutes in this case).
3. Calculate the total work time.
4. Calculate the percentage of the total work time spent editing.

Step 1: Time spent recording the song
Time spent writing the song = 4 hours
Time spent recording the song = 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours

Step 2: Convert all times to minutes
Time spent writing the song in minutes = 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
Time spent recording the song in minutes = 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
Time spent editing the song = 90 minutes (already in minutes)

Step 3: Calculate the total work time
Total work time = Time writing + Time recording + Time editing
Total work time = 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes
Total work time = 450 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the total work time spent editing
Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
Percentage spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100
Percentage spent editing = 0.2 * 100
Percentage spent editing = 20%

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to add the cards she initially made, the cards her dad brought, and the cards she received, and then subtract the cards she passed out.

Erica made 20 cards.
Her dad brought 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards.
She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards Erica has is:
20 (made) + 30 (dad's) + 17 (received) = 67 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, which is a total of:
24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Subtracting the cards she passed out from the total number of cards she has:
67 - 29 = 38 cards.

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many slices of pizza each person gets and then subtract those from the total number of slices to find out how many are left.

1. The total number of slices is 12.
2. Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 slices.
3. Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 slices.
4. Jenny eats 2 slices herself.

Now, we add up the slices given away and eaten:
4 (Bill) + 3 (Mark) + 2 (Jenny) = 9 slices.

Finally, we subtract the total slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices:
12 - 9 = 3 slices left.

"To find out how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner before the reduction.
2. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner after the reduction.
3. Find the difference in daily energy usage to determine the daily savings.
4. Multiply the daily savings by 30 to find the total savings over 30 days.

Step 1: Daily energy usage before reduction
The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. For 8 hours, the usage is:
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours

Step 2: Daily energy usage after reduction
If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for 3 hours a day:
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours

Step 3: Daily savings
The difference in energy usage is the amount saved each day:
7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours

Step 4: Total savings over 30 days
To find the total savings in kilowatt-hours (kWh), we convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours by dividing by 1000 and then multiply by 30 days:
4500 watt-hours/day / 1000 = 4.5 kWh/day
4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days.

- One zebra with 36 stripes: 36 stripes
- One zebra with half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: 36 / 2 = 18 stripes

Now, we add up all the stripes:
34 (from the two zebras) + 36 (from the one zebra) + 18 (from the last zebra) = 88 stripes

Next, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras to find the average:
88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

"To find out how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required and then multiply by their respective costs.

First, we determine how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people served per sandwich:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Next, we calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed. Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, we calculate the cost for the meat and cheese:

5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese to find the total cost:

$35.00 (meat) + $15.00 (cheese) = $50.00

So, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Allan has 40 cannolis in his house.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.
3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.
4. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.
5. Adding the new corns to the original amount, he now has 80 + 60 = 140 corns.
6. The combined total of corns and cannolis is 140 + 100 = 240.

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before his jog, he had completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. This means that before his jog, he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps completed or in progress.

Since he had 6,000 steps before his jog and 8,000 steps after his jog, the number of steps he took during his jog is 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Add the total payments for May and June to get the final amount.

Step 1: Total payment for May
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hours per week: 40
- Pay rate: $15 per hour
- Weeks in May: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

Total payment for May = Number of employees * Hours per week * Pay rate * Weeks in May
Total payment for May = 40 * 40 * $15 * 4

Step 2: Number of employees in June
- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees continued working.
- Number of employees in June = 3/4 * Number of employees in May
- Number of employees in June = 3/4 * 40

Step 3: Total payment for June
- We will use the same hours per week and pay rate for June.
- Weeks in June: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

Total payment for June = Number of employees in June * Hours per week * Pay rate * Weeks in June
Total payment for June = (3/4 * 40) * 40 * $15 * 4

Step 4: Total payment for May and June
Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June

Now, let's calculate the numbers:

Total payment for May = 40 * 40 * $15 * 4 = 40 * 40 * 60 = 96,000

Number of employees in June = 3/4 * 40 = 30

Total payment for June = 30 * 40 * $15 * 4 = 30 * 40 * 60 = 72,000

Total payment for May and June = 96,000 + 72,000 = 168,000

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $168,000.

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy:
- The first pound of taffy costs $3.
- The second pound is 1/2 off, so it costs $3 * 1/2 = $1.50.
- The total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, the cost of the mixed bag of seashells is $1.50.

Then, the cost of the 4 magnets:
- Each magnet costs $0.25, so 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all her expenses:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00
- Total expenses: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Finally, we subtract the total expenses from the $10 Sally had:

"To find out how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks before and after the discount, and then add the cost of the finale firework.

First, we calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:
- The first package costs $400.
- The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages before the discount is:
$400 + $800 = $1200.

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the two packages:
- The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The cost of the two packages after the discount is:
$1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted price of the two packages:
$960 + $150 = $1110.

So, the total amount Tim spent is:
$1110.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. 

First, we need to find out how many candles are expected to explode. Since Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, 1% of them are expected to explode. 

1% of 50,000 candles is:
0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles

Next, we need to find out how many of these exploding candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the more dangerous candles (the ones that explode) have this defect.

5% of 500 candles is:
0.05 * 500 = 25 candles

So, 25 of Marcy's candles are expected to both explode and smell like wet dog.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount and then apply it to the regular price of the blouses.

The regular price for each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount on the rack. To find the discount amount for one blouse, we calculate 30% of $20:

Discount amount per blouse = 30% of $20
                           = 0.30 * $20
                           = $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to find the discounted price for one blouse:

Discounted price per blouse = Regular price - Discount amount
                            = $20 - $6
                            = $14

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we multiply the discounted price of one blouse by 4 to find the total cost:

Total cost of the discounted blouses = Discounted price per blouse * Number of blouses
                                    = $14 * 4
                                    = $56

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, let's call this number \( x \).
4. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
5. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
6. Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.
7. The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500.

We can set up the equation to represent the total number of apples gathered:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

First, we can solve the first equation for \( d \):
\( d = 180 - c \)

Next, we substitute \( d \) in the second equation:
\( 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \)

Simplify and solve for \( c \):
\( 2c + 180 - c = 304 \)
\( c = 304 - 180 \)
\( c = 124 \)

Now that we have the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting \( c \) back into the equation for \( d \):
\( d = 180 - 124 \)
\( d = 56 \)

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and sum the distances.

1. For the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day:
   4 days * 200 kilometers/day = 800 kilometers

2. Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days:
   30% of 800 kilometers = 0.30 * 800 kilometers = 240 kilometers

3. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for that day is:
   0 kilometers

4. During the second week (7 days), he made 300 kilometers every day:
   7 days * 300 kilometers/day = 2100 kilometers

Now, we add up all the distances:
800 kilometers (first 4 days) + 240 kilometers (next 2 days) + 0 kilometers (rest day) + 2100 kilometers (second week) = 3140 kilometers

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
3140 kilometers"
"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we can start by determining the size of Zack's locker since we know the size of Peter's locker and the relationship between Zack's and Peter's lockers.

Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. So, to find the size of Zack's locker, we multiply Peter's locker size by 4:

Zack's locker size = Peter's locker size * 4
Zack's locker size = 5 cubic inches * 4
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, and it is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

Timothy's locker size = Zack's locker size * 2
Timothy's locker size = 20 cubic inches * 2
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to determine the elevation of the ledge where the comb landed and then calculate the difference between that elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. So, the elevation of the ledge where the comb landed is:

10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb to the 6,000 feet elevation. The number of feet Oliver must climb is:

6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the amounts he received from the two banks to his initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000.
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.
He initially had $5000 in capital.

So, the total capital he has now is the sum of the initial capital and the amounts from the two banks:
$5000 (initial capital) + $4000 (first bank) + $8000 (second bank) = $17000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, 4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats were carried away.
3. After the boats carried away 20 cats, there are 50 - 20 = 30 cats left on the rock.
4. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats ran after the mouse.
5. After 18 cats ran after the mouse, there are 30 - 18 = 12 cats left on the rock.

The final number of cats left on the rock is:

"To calculate the total cost of the streaming service for 2 years, we need to break down the costs into the different periods and then sum them up.

1. The first 6 months at the special introductory deal: 6 months * $8/month = $48
2. The next 8 months at the normal price: 8 months * $12/month = $96
3. The remaining time in the 2-year period (24 months - 6 months - 8 months = 10 months) at the increased price: 10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add up all the costs to get the total for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The tattered jeans cost $28.
2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22.
3. Cole saved a total of $6.
4. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is 1/3 * $6 = $2.
5. The rest of the savings, which is 2/3 of the total savings, came from the tattered jeans, so that's 2/3 * $6 = $4.

Now, to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to determine the original prices of both pairs of jeans before the savings.

6. The tattered jeans were bought for $28 after saving $4, so the original price was $28 + $4 = $32.
7. The jogger jeans were bought for $22 after saving $2, so the original price was $22 + $2 = $24.

Finally, to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we subtract the original price of the tattered jeans from the original price of the jogger jeans:

$24 - $32 = -$8

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, which implies a positive value. Since the result is negative, it means the tattered jeans originally cost more than the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans actually cost $8 less than the tattered jeans, not more. Therefore, the answer to the question as stated is 0, because the jogger jeans do not cost more than the tattered jeans.

"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles rented for the trip.

The capacity of the buses is:
4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees

The capacity of the minibusses is:
6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees

The capacity of the minivans is:
10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up all the capacities to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
240 employees + 180 employees + 150 employees = 570 employees

"Lillian has built 3 bird feeders and bought 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, so the 3 store-bought feeders attract:
3 feeders * 20 birds per feeder = 60 birds

The homemade feeders attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. Therefore, the 3 homemade feeders attract:
3 feeders * 30 birds per feeder = 90 birds

Adding the birds attracted by the store-bought and homemade feeders together, we get:
60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds

Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

The cost of the bagel is $4.

The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to the original price of the bagel:
25% of $4 = 0.25 * $4 = $1
So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is:
1/2 * $4 = $2.

Now, we add up the cost of all the items:
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then calculate the total number of cards, including the ones he kept.

First, we know that Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left over, so he must have made $150 from selling his cards.

Now, we can calculate how many cards he sold by dividing the total amount of money he made by the price per card:

$150 / $1.5 per card = 100 cards

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, the 100 cards he sold represent the remaining 2/3 of his collection. To find the total number of cards, we can set up the following equation:

2/3 * total cards = 100 cards

To find the total number of cards, we can solve for the total:

total cards = 100 cards / (2/3)
total cards = 100 cards * (3/2)
total cards = 150 cards

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially told to prepare for 36 guests.
2. Most guests would eat one hot dog, but the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs.
3. Half of 36 guests is 18 guests, so the caterer prepared 18 extra hot dogs for those 18 guests to have a second one.
4. Therefore, the caterer prepared 36 (one for each guest) + 18 (extra for half the guests) = 54 hot dogs in total.
5. However, 40 guests showed up, and all of them wanted a second hot dog.
6. For 40 guests to each have two hot dogs, the caterer would need 40 * 2 = 80 hot dogs.
7. Since the caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs, the number of hot dogs short is 80 - 54 = 26.
8. Since each guest who didn't get a second hot dog is missing one hot dog, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is equal to the number of hot dogs short, which is 26.

"To find the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we first need to calculate the number of letters in her sister's name.

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in both names to get the total:

Indras' name: 6 letters
Her sister's name: 7 letters
Total: 6 + 7 = 13 letters

"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order after the 20% discount, we first need to determine the total cost before the discount. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00.

"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then subtract the amount of money she already has.

The cost of the skipping rope is $6.
The cost of the board game is $11.
The cost of the playground ball is $2.

The total cost of the items is:
$6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Dora has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16, so the total amount of money she has is:
$2 + $16 = $18

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many gallons of gas are in one container.
2. Calculate how many gallons 1/4 of a container is.
3. Convert the gallons to pints, knowing that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints.

Step 1: Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5 to find out how many gallons are in one container.
15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Step 2: Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we calculate 1/4 of 3 gallons.
3 gallons * 1/4 = 0.75 gallons

Step 3: Convert 0.75 gallons to pints.
0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he had 1% of $5 left, or $0.05.
2. This means he actually spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95 on chips and candy bars.
3. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, so he spent 3 * $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.
4. The remaining amount he spent on candy bars is $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.
5. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is $3.75 / $0.75.

Now, let's calculate the number of candy bars:

$3.75 / $0.75 = 5

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together.
2. Determine the total number of people sharing the oranges (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends).
3. Divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Let's do the math:

1. Total number of oranges = Sitti's oranges + Juris's oranges
   Total number of oranges = 34 + 22
   Total number of oranges = 56

2. Total number of people = Sitti + Juris + 6 friends
   Total number of people = 1 + 1 + 6
   Total number of people = 8

3. Oranges per person = Total number of oranges / Total number of people
   Oranges per person = 56 / 8
   Oranges per person = 7

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide that by the number of servings.

First, we calculate the cost of the onions:
- Antoine doubles the amount of onions, so he uses 2 * 2 = 4 pounds.
- The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so 4 pounds cost 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of the beef stock:
- He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00, so the total cost for beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of onions + cost of beef stock = $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Finally, we divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving:
- The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she needs to leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

1. Wayne's drive time to the theater is 4 minutes.
2. Bernadette's drive time is four times Wayne's, so it is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
3. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to account for her longer drive time plus the 5-minute difference.

Wayne's total time to the theater is 4 minutes. Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, so she needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne's arrival time.

However, since it takes her 16 minutes to drive, she needs to leave 16 minutes before her arrival time. To find out how much earlier she needs to leave compared to Wayne, we add the 9 minutes (to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne) to her 16-minute drive time:

16 (drive time) + 5 (time before Wayne's arrival) = 21 minutes.

Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = Length × Width

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet because the area is given in square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so:

Length in feet = 3 yards × 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now we can solve for the width:

360 square feet = 9 feet × Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)

Substituting the values we have:

Perimeter = 2 × (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 × 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

(1 + 2) * 20
3 * 20
60 beads

Margareth's total beads:
(3 packs of blue + 4 packs of red) * 20 beads/pack
(3 + 4) * 20
7 * 20

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon.
   - Swim: 40 minutes
   - Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
   - Run: 50 minutes
   - Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

2. Next, we need to calculate the time it took James to complete the swim, which is 10% faster than Jon.
   - 10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes (10/100 * 40 = 4)
   - James's swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

3. James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon.
   - James's bike time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

4. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
   - James's total time: 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

5. To find out how long it took James to do the run, we subtract the time he took for the swim and the bike from his total time.
   - James's run time: 180 - (36 + 85) = 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).
2. Then, we calculate how many bails of hay the horse will eat based on the distance run.
3. Next, we find out the total cost of the hay.
4. Finally, we calculate the change Michael will have after buying the hay.

Step 1: Distance run in 30 minutes
Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, in 30 minutes (which is half an hour), the horse will run:
32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Step 2: Bails of hay needed
For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails of hay

Step 3: Total cost of the hay
Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails will be:
8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Step 4: Change after buying the hay
Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which means he has:
6 * $5 = $30

After buying the hay for $24, the change Michael will have is:
$30 - $24 = $6

So, the final numerical answer is:

5. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Cost per sneaker:
   Total cost / Number of sneakers = $576 / 48 = $12 per sneaker

2. Revenue from the flash sale:
   Number of sneakers sold at flash sale * Price per sneaker = 17 * $20 = $340

3. Number of sneakers sold to the department store:
   Total number of sneakers - Number of sneakers sold at flash sale = 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers

   Number of sneakers sold to the department store * Price per sneaker = 31 * $25 = $775

5. Total revenue:
   Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from department store = $340 + $775 = $1115

6. Total cost:
   Cost per sneaker * Total number of sneakers = $12 * 48 = $576

"Let's break down the costs and savings to find the regular price of the popcorn.

If you buy the super ticket, the total cost is $20 for the movie and one popcorn with a soda for $1 extra, making it $21 in total.

If you buy the regular movie ticket, it costs $12. The soda costs $3, and we need to find the cost of the popcorn, which we'll call P.

The total cost for the regular ticket, soda, and popcorn is $12 + $3 + P.

You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, which means the cost of the regular ticket, soda, and popcorn is $2 less than the super ticket cost.

So, we can set up the equation:

$12 + $3 + P = $21 - $2

Now, let's solve for P:

$15 + P = $19
P = $19 - $15
P = $4

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the original cost of filling one helium balloon. We can do this by dividing the total cost by the number of balloons filled on the first day.

Original cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
Original cost per balloon = $900 / 20
Original cost per balloon = $45

After the price increase, the new cost per balloon is the original cost plus the increase.

New cost per balloon = Original cost per balloon + Price increase
New cost per balloon = $45 + $20
New cost per balloon = $65

Now, we can calculate how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price.

Total cost for 170 balloons = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost for 170 balloons = $65 * 170
Total cost for 170 balloons = $11,050

The final numerical answer is:
11050"
"To calculate the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, we calculate the distance traveled at each speed:
- At 60 mph for 2 hours, the distance is 60 * 2 = 120 miles.
- At 30 mph for 1 hour, the distance is 30 * 1 = 30 miles.

The total distance traveled is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

"To find out how much the potting soil will cost Bob, we need to calculate the total volume of soil required and then determine the cost based on the volume and price per bag.

First, we calculate the volume of one raised bed:
Volume of one bed = width * length * height
Volume of one bed = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet
Volume of one bed = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total volume = volume of one bed * number of beds
Total volume = 32 cubic feet * 10
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = total volume / volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag
Number of bags = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total cost = number of bags * cost per bag
Total cost = 160 bags * $12 per bag
Total cost = $1920

The potting soil will cost Bob $1920.

"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green and yellow cards based on the information given.

1. We know there are 15 red cards.
2. There are 60% more green cards than red cards. To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15:
   \( 15 \times 0.60 = 9 \)
   \( 15 + 9 = 24 \) green cards.

3. The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards:
   \( 15 + 24 = 39 \) yellow cards.

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the red, green, and yellow cards together:
\( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \)

So, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78.

1. Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
   Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

2. Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's spotted puppies + Brandon's spotted puppies
   Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

3. Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
   Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100

4. Calculate the percentage:
   Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100 = 35%

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then divide the total weight by the truck's capacity.

1. Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
2. Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
3. Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
4. Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
Total weight = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, so we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find out how many trips are needed:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
Number of trips = 2

Since the number of trips is a whole number, the farmer will need exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many plants Toni has.
2. Use the number of plants Toni has to find out how many plants Shondra has.

First, we know that Frederick has 10 plants. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find out how many plants Toni has, we calculate 60% of Frederick's plants and add that to the number of plants Frederick has:

60% of 10 plants = 0.60 * 10 = 6 plants

So, Toni has 10 plants + 6 plants = 16 plants.

Now, Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So we subtract 7 from the number of plants Toni has:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 plants - 7 plants = 9 plants

Shondra has 9 plants.

"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards

Next, we'll calculate the total number of baseball cards:

5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards

Now, we'll add the basketball and baseball cards to find the total number of cards:

150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract those from the total:

350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

These 300 cards are the ones she gives to her students. If each student gets 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the number of cards given away by the number of cards each student receives:

300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for both Becky and Kelly, taking into account the discounts they received, and then find the difference between the two amounts.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents or $9.00.
- Becky received a $1 discount, so the final cost for Becky is $9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents or $10.00.
- Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is 10% of $10.00, which is $1.00.
- The final cost for Kelly is $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, we find the difference between what Kelly paid and what Becky paid:
- Kelly paid $9.00 and Becky paid $8.00.
- The difference is $9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00.

So, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky.

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt has to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we can set the equation equal to 5 and solve for \( c \):

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Now, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the shark's length to inches, since the remoras' lengths are given in inches.
2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
3. Divide the combined length of the remoras by the shark's length in inches.
4. Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The shark is 10 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the shark's length in inches is:
   10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

2. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length is:
   2 remoras * 6 inches/remora = 12 inches

3. The ratio of the combined length of the remoras to the shark's length is:
   12 inches / 120 inches = 0.1

4. To convert this ratio to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   0.1 * 100 = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:
9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15

However, this sum counts the kids who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts twice, so we need to subtract the number of kids who are allergic to both:
15 - 3 (both) = 12

This means that 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class:
32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic to dairy or peanuts) = 20

"To calculate the cost per individual razor after the discount and coupon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of 2 packs of razors with the buy one get one free offer.
2. Apply the $2.00 coupon to the total cost.
3. Calculate the cost per razor.

Step 1: The cost of 2 packs of razors with the buy one get one free offer is the cost of 1 pack because the second pack is free. So, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00.

Step 2: Apply the $2.00 coupon to the $4.00 cost, which brings the total cost down to $2.00.

Step 3: Since 2 packs contain 8 razors (4 razors per pack), we divide the total cost by the number of razors to find the cost per razor.

$2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.25 to cents:

$0.25 = 25 cents

So, the cost per individual razor after the discount and coupon is 25 cents.

"To calculate the height of the human pyramid, we need to add up the heights of the cheerleaders, starting with the shortest at the top and moving down to the base.

The 10th cheerleader, who is the shortest at 60 inches, will be at the top.
The next level will have 2 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.
The next level will have 3 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.
The bottom level will have 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.

Let's calculate the total height in inches and then convert it to feet.

Top level (1 cheerleader): 60 inches
Second level (2 cheerleaders): 2 * 64 inches = 128 inches
Third level (3 cheerleaders): 3 * 64 inches = 192 inches
Bottom level (4 cheerleaders): 4 * 64 inches = 256 inches

Total height in inches = 60 + 128 + 192 + 256 = 636 inches

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot).

Total height in feet = 636 inches / 12 inches/foot = 53 feet

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, which means she will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old.
4. Since this is Angela's age in four years, we need to subtract 4 to find her current age: 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to consider the cost of each ride and the number of rides he took.

Each morning ride costs $6, and he drives in the morning twice a day for 14 days, so the total cost for the morning rides is:
$6 * 2 rides/day * 14 days = $168

Each afternoon ride costs $2, and he drives in the afternoon twice a day for 14 days, so the total cost for the afternoon rides is:
$2 * 2 rides/day * 14 days = $56

Now, we add the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides to get the total cost:
$168 + $56 = $224

Therefore, Paul spent $224 on driving his car during these two weeks.

"To find out how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that number by the number of oranges needed for one pie.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ashley brought:
Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so:
5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought:
Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:
50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges

Now, let's find the total number of oranges they have together:
50 oranges (Ashley) + 70 oranges (Brianne) = 120 oranges

Finally, we need to determine how many pies they can make with 120 oranges, knowing that one pie needs 3 oranges:
120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie = 40 pies

So, they can make 40 Greek orange pies.

"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost of the first venue is equal to the total cost of the second venue.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per person for food. So the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per person, which includes food. So the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We set these two costs equal to each other to find the number of guests where the costs are the same:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as L, D, and B, respectively.

According to the problem, we have the following equations:

1. L + D + B = 43 (the total number of insects collected)
2. L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. D = B / 2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)

From equation 3, we can express B in terms of D:

B = 2D

Now we can substitute L and B from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

(D + 7) + D + (2D) = 43

Combine like terms:

4D + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

4D = 36

Divide by 4:

D = 9

Now that we know D, we can find L using equation 2:

L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16

Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then multiply by the total number of yards in a skein.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 4 in this case.

1/4 (Mariah's portion) + 2/4 (Grandma's portion, because 1/2 is equivalent to 2/4) = 3/4 (total portion used)

Now, we multiply the total portion used by the number of yards in a skein:

3/4 * 364 yards = 273 yards

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

2 friends * 5 gifts/friend = 10 gifts

For the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each:
3 friends * 2 gifts/friend = 6 gifts

Adding the 10 random gifts:
10 random gifts

Now, we add all the gifts together:
10 gifts (for the 2 friends) + 6 gifts (for the 3 friends) + 10 random gifts = 26 gifts

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Suzie bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum at an unknown price, let's call it S dollars per pack.
- 1 pack of grape gum for $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of the gum is $7. We can write the equation as follows:

2 * S (strawberry gum) + $2 (grape gum) + $1 (green apple gum) = $7

Now we can solve for S:

2S + 2 + 1 = 7
2S + 3 = 7
2S = 7 - 3
2S = 4
S = 4 / 2
S = 2

Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood and then figure out the best combination within his budget.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks.
  Cost per stick from 2 x 4 = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.
  Cost per stick from 2 x 8 = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood provides a lower cost per stick, it is the cheaper option. However, the question asks for the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber, which in this case is the 2 x 4 piece of wood.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood he can buy with $24:

- Number of 2 x 4 pieces he can buy = $24 / $4 per piece = 6 pieces

Since each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

- Total sticks from 2 x 4 = 6 pieces * 200 sticks per piece = 1200 sticks

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber (2 x 4) is:

"To calculate the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of legs for all dogs.
2. Calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair.

Step 1: Total number of legs
Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs.
Total legs = 4 legs/dog * 6 dogs = 24 legs

Step 2: Number of pairs of snowshoes
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs.
Number of pairs = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs

Step 3: Total cost
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00

Therefore, it will cost Mario $144.00 to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs.

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass and then compare it to the cost of the pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the bus trips without the pass:
- Janet takes 2 bus trips per day.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- She takes these trips 5 days a week.

Total cost per week without the pass:
2 trips/day * $2.20/trip * 5 days/week = $22.00/week

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.00.

Savings by buying the weekly bus pass:
Total cost without the pass - Cost of the pass
$22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, Janet would save $2.00 per week by buying the weekly bus pass.

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we first need to determine the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th, and then calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.

1. Calculate the total number of days:
- From January 1st to July 19th (since today is December 31st, we start counting from the next day, January 1st):
- January has 31 days, but we start on the 1st, so we count 31 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year and 29 days in a leap year.
- March has 31 days.
- April has 30 days.
- May has 31 days.
- June has 30 days.
- July has 19 days up to the 19th.

Let's add these up to find the total number of days:

31 (January) + 28 (February, assuming it's not a leap year) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 19 (July) = 200 days

2. Calculate the total number of calories to lose 30 lbs:
- 1 lb of body weight is approximately equal to 3500 calories.
- To lose 30 lbs, Andy needs to burn 30 * 3500 calories.

30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories

3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit:
- To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total number of calories by the number of days.

105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories per day

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal by July 19th.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

"Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has, and \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so we can write:

\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]

We are also told that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so:

\[ S_O = 20 \]

Substituting the value of \( S_O \) into the first equation, we get:

\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]

Solving for \( C_O \), we find:

\[ C_O = 20 + 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Now, let's consider Jenna. Let \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has, and \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has. We know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so:

\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so:

\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Now we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:

Total sofas = \( S_O + S_J \)
Total sofas = \( 20 + 64 \)
Total sofas = \( 84 \)

Total chairs = \( C_O + C_J \)
Total chairs = \( 22 + 66 \)
Total chairs = \( 88 \)

Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs
Total number of sofas and chairs = \( 84 + 88 \)
Total number of sofas and chairs = \( 172 \)

4 hours/week * 8 weeks = 32 hours

Next, we'll add the extra hours he spent working out on the occasions that were different:
- For the two consecutive weeks where he spent 5 hours each week, he worked out an extra hour each week compared to his usual 4 hours, so that's 2 extra hours in total.
- For the week where he spent 6 hours, he worked out 2 extra hours compared to his usual 4 hours.

So, the total extra hours are:
2 extra hours (from the two 5-hour weeks) + 2 extra hours (from the 6-hour week) = 4 extra hours

Now, we add the extra hours to the initial total:
32 hours (initial total) + 4 hours (extra hours) = 36 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

On the first stop:
- 8 passengers get off, so 48 - 8 = 40 passengers remain.
- 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on, so 5 * 8 = 40 passengers get on.
- The new total is 40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80 passengers.

On the second stop:
- 21 passengers get off, so 80 - 21 = 59 passengers remain.
- 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 1/3 of the number who got off, so 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on.
- The new total is 59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66 passengers.

The number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so currently Jame is:
   27 - 5 = 22 years old.

2. In 8 years, Jame will be:
   22 + 8 = 30 years old.

3. At that time, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age, so:
   2 * 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

4. This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old, so currently the cousin is:
   55 - 8 = 47 years old.

5. The age difference between Jame and his cousin now is:
   47 - 22 = 25 years.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the cost of one monitor, we can start by determining the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost:

$1,100 - $400 = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the two monitors is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total to find the combined cost of the two monitors:

$2,400 - $1,100 - $700 = $600

Since this is the cost for two monitors, we divide by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

$600 / 2 = $300

So, one monitor cost $300.

"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we need to calculate the number of seashells the girls brought in addition to the number the boys brought.

Each boy brought back 60 shells. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means each girl brought:

60 (the number of shells each boy brought) + 4 * 60 (four times the number of shells each boy brought)

Let's calculate that:

60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300

So, each girl brought 300 seashells.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to add the thickness of each book together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

Now, we add the thickness of all four books together:

31 mm (first book) + 50 mm (second book) + 45 mm (third book) + 62 mm (fourth book) = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

"To calculate the total amount you need to pay, you first need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill and then add that to the original bill. After that, since the bill is being split evenly, you will pay half of the total bill plus the full tip.

1. Calculate the tip: 20% of $50 is $10.
2. Add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.
3. Since the bill is split evenly, you pay half of the original bill: $50 / 2 = $25.
4. Add the tip to your half of the bill: $25 + $10 = $35.

So, you end up paying $35.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

April has 30 days, so the first half of the month consists of 15 days, and the second half also consists of 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month as \( x \). According to the problem, he saves twice as much each day in the second half, which would be \( 2x \).

The total savings for the month can be expressed as:
\[ 15x + 15(2x) = 1125 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Since \( x \) is the amount saved each day in the first half, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

So, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of April.

The cost of the oranges is:
5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00

The cost of the peaches is:
6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

The total cost of the fruits is:
$4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00

Now, subtract the total cost from the amount Verna gave:

"Let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \). According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find out how much Brad gets, we divide both sides by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ B = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we can calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 \]
\[ 4B = 80 \]

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of letters Elise has written.

1. First, Elise writes the full alphabet twice. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so writing it twice would be:
   26 letters * 2 = 52 letters

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is:
   26 letters / 2 = 13 letters

3. After that, she re-writes everything she has already written. At this point, she has written 52 letters from the first step and 13 letters from the second step, for a total of:
   52 letters + 13 letters = 65 letters

4. Rewriting everything she has already written means she writes another 65 letters.

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
   52 letters (first full alphabet twice) + 13 letters (half alphabet) + 65 letters (rewriting everything) = 130 letters

"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to find the total cost without the discount, and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of five notebooks is:
5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50

The cost of two pens is:
2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50

The cost of one calculator is:
1 calculator * $12.00/calculator = $12.00

The cost of one geometry set is:
1 geometry set * $10.00/geometry set = $10.00

The total cost without the discount is:
$7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

The total cost with the discount is:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

So, Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy.

For the sales over $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, the commission is an additional 10%:
$1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add both parts of the commission to find the total earnings:
$300 (commission for the first $1000) + $150 (additional commission for sales over $1000) = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned a total of $450 in commission.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Ray takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water, and then find the difference between the two times.

First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 1 mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Since it takes him 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, we can calculate the time for warm water as follows:

Warm water time for 1 mile = 2 * (Cold water time for 1 mile) + 2 minutes
Warm water time for 1 mile = 2 * 16 minutes + 2 minutes
Warm water time for 1 mile = 32 minutes + 2 minutes
Warm water time for 1 mile = 34 minutes

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions:

Cold water time for 3 miles = 3 * (Cold water time for 1 mile)
Cold water time for 3 miles = 3 * 16 minutes
Cold water time for 3 miles = 48 minutes

Warm water time for 3 miles = 3 * (Warm water time for 1 mile)
Warm water time for 3 miles = 3 * 34 minutes
Warm water time for 3 miles = 102 minutes

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:

Difference in time = Warm water time for 3 miles - Cold water time for 3 miles
Difference in time = 102 minutes - 48 minutes
Difference in time = 54 minutes

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day.

7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the remaining number of buttons is:
21 buttons - 7 buttons = 14 buttons

These 14 buttons each have four holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is:
14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine the weight of each person.

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.

Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so:

Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so:
Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 * 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, to find the average weight, we add the weights of all three friends and divide by the number of friends:

Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3
Average weight = (150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds) / 3
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night. Assuming she read every night of the week, that's 7 nights. So, the total reading time in the first week is:

15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes

Now, we need to convert the reading time into pages. Since she reads 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute:

3 wooden action figures/day * 4 days = 12 wooden action figures

Now, let's calculate how much money he has left after these 4 days:

$70 - (4 days * 3 wooden action figures/day * $5/wooden action figure) = $70 - (4 * 3 * $5) = $70 - $60 = $10

For the remaining 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He will spend the remaining $10 equally over these 3 days:

$10 / 3 days = approximately $3.33 per day

Since he can only buy whole action figures, he will buy 1 plastic action figure each day for the remaining 3 days:

1 plastic action figure/day * 3 days = 3 plastic action figures

Now, we can calculate the total number of action figures:

12 wooden action figures + 3 plastic action figures = 15 action figures

Therefore, by the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 15 action figures.

"To find out how much the kitten has cost so far, we need to add up the cost of spaying, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the 3 vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the 4 broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, we add these costs together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (broken vases) = $308.

The total cost so far is $308.

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops and compare it to the number of roses Ford can grow.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops per week:
- The first shop orders 20 roses.
- The second shop orders 15 roses.
- The third shop orders 30 roses.

Total roses required per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses required per month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks:
Total roses required per month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Next, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford can grow per month:
Roses grown per week = 40
Roses grown per month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Now, we can determine how many roses Ford lacks:
Roses Ford lacks = Total roses required per month - Roses grown per month
Roses Ford lacks = 260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

"To find out how much money Katina will have in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she will withdraw over that period and subtract it from her initial balance.

Katina withdraws $100 every month. There are 12 months in a year, so over 2 years, she will make:

2 years * 12 months/year = 24 months

The total amount withdrawn over 24 months will be:

24 months * $100/month = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial balance:

$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 (since one loaf makes 10 sandwiches).
The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.
So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00.

The revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of small crayon pieces Kate has.
2. Determine how many crayon muffins she can make.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she can make by selling the crayon muffins.

Step 1: Total number of small crayon pieces
Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so the total number of crayon pieces is:
3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayon pieces

Step 2: Number of crayon muffins
Since it takes 8 small pieces to make one crayon muffin, the number of crayon muffins she can make is:
192 crayon pieces / 8 pieces/muffin = 24 crayon muffins

Step 3: Total money made
If she sells each crayon muffin for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is:
24 crayon muffins * $1.50/muffin = $36.00

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to consider the cost of the new carpet, the padding, the removal of the old carpet, and the installation of the new carpet. We will calculate each of these costs based on the area of the bedroom and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the area of the bedroom:
Area = length × width
Area = 18 feet × 12 feet
Area = 216 square feet

Now, let's calculate each of the costs:

1. Cost of the new carpet:
Cost of carpet = area × cost per square foot
Cost of carpet = 216 square feet × $12/square foot
Cost of carpet = $2,592

2. Cost of the padding:
Cost of padding = area × cost per square foot
Cost of padding = 216 square feet × $2/square foot
Cost of padding = $432

3. Cost to remove the old carpet:
Cost of removal = area × cost per square foot
Cost of removal = 216 square feet × $4/square foot
Cost of removal = $864

4. Cost to install the new carpet:
Cost of installation = area × cost per square foot
Cost of installation = 216 square feet × $34/square foot
Cost of installation = $7,344

Now, we add all these costs together to get the total cost:
Total cost = Cost of carpet + Cost of padding + Cost of removal + Cost of installation
Total cost = $2,592 + $432 + $864 + $7,344
Total cost = $11,232

The total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $11,232.

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw each day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown:
- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

First, we add up all the birds:
50 (days one and two) + 0 (day three) + 120 (days four and five) + 20 (day six) + 90 (day seven) = 280 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days in the week to find the average:
280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds per day

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. We need to add half of the starting value to the starting value itself.
3. The result from step 2 is then divided by 5.
4. The result from step 3 is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12.

Let's calculate it:

1. Starting value: \(20\)
2. Half of the starting value: \(20 / 2 = 10\)
3. Starting value plus half the starting value: \(20 + 10 = 30\)
4. Dividing the result from step 3 by 5: \(30 / 5 = 6\)
5. Starting value minus 12: \(20 - 12 = 8\)
6. Multiplying the result from step 4 by the result from step 5: \(6 * 8 = 48\)

The final value of the number train is \(48\).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage increase from the set temperature to the actual temperature when the oven is set to 450 degrees.

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the set temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

468 - 450 = 18 degrees

The percentage increase is:

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the temperature to set the oven to so that it will actually reach 520 degrees, given that it will be 4% higher than the set temperature.

Let x be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be x + 4% of x, which should equal 520 degrees.

x + 0.04x = 520
1.04x = 520
x = 520 / 1.04
x = 500

Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. So, the second movie is:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the duration of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

So, Juan's house is worth:
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, to find the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Herb's house and Juan's house together:
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The combined value of the two houses is $129,200.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.
2. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups to the event.
4. Judy's friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so the friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils
- Friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils

Adding both together, we get the total number of utensils:

"To find out how much each pair of contacts will cost Pete if he buys 2 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount.
2. Determine the total number of contacts Pete will get from 2 boxes.
3. Divide the total cost by the total number of contacts to find the cost per contact.

Let's do the math:

1. The cost of 1 box of contacts is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the cost of 1 box is:
   $100.00 - ($100.00 * 0.10) = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

   Therefore, the cost for 2 boxes is:
   $90.00 * 2 = $180.00

2. Each box contains 90 contacts, so 2 boxes will contain:
   90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts

3. The cost per contact is:
   $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00/contact

Since contacts are typically used in pairs, we need to find the cost per pair:
   $1.00/contact * 2 contacts/pair = $2.00/pair

So, the cost per pair of contacts is $2.00.

John's hours:
- Saturday: 2 times Jill's Saturday hours = 2 * 2 = 4 hours
- Sunday: 3 times Jill's Sunday hours = 3 * 1 = 3 hours
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Now, we calculate their earnings:
- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

The difference in their earnings:
- John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total number of calories she burns during her exercise.

Hannah burns 500 calories per hour doing aerobics. Since she does aerobics for 2 hours, the total calories burned from aerobics is:
500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories

Hannah also burns 600 calories per hour running. Since she runs for 1 hour, the total calories burned from running is:
600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories

The total calories burned from both activities is:
1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. To find out how much water she needs to drink, we divide the total calories burned by 200 and then multiply by 100 ml:

(1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express these relationships as:

\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500:

\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} \]
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

\[ R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:

\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. We can represent the height of the beanstalk on day n as:

Height on day n = Initial height * 2^(n-1)

Where n is the number of days since planting. We want to find the smallest n such that the height is greater than 20 feet.

Let's calculate:

Day 1: 4 * 2^(1-1) = 4 * 2^0 = 4 * 1 = 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2^(2-1) = 4 * 2^1 = 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 4 * 2^(3-1) = 4 * 2^2 = 4 * 4 = 16 feet
Day 4: 4 * 2^(4-1) = 4 * 2^3 = 4 * 8 = 32 feet

"To calculate the total cost of the dental work, we need to consider the cost of the two implants and the additional cost for the porcelain crown. Then we will subtract the deposit George has already made. Finally, we will divide the remaining amount by George's hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work.

The cost of the two implants is:
2 * $2000 = $4000

The additional cost for the porcelain crown is:
$500

So the total cost of the dental work is:
$4000 + $500 = $4500

George has already put down a deposit of:

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the second angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \) degrees, and the third angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} \]
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is:

"To calculate the total earnings, we need to break down the sales into two parts and then sum them up.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, the earnings for the first four hours are:
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup * 4 hours = $30.00

For the next two hours, he sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, the earnings for the next two hours are:
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup * 2 hours = $12.00

Now, we add the earnings from both parts to get the total earnings:
$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

Patrick earned a total of $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires will undergo in a month, and then determine how many months (and subsequently years) it will take to reach the maximum number of rotations a tire can undergo.

First, we calculate the number of rotations per mile:
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Next, we calculate the number of rotations for 400 miles:
362.5 rotations per mile * 400 miles = 145,000 rotations per month

Now, we need to find out how many months it will take to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations per month = 72 months

Finally, we convert months into years:
72 months / 12 months per year = 6 years

So, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle gives 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, doubling the number of washes (because she uses half the amount of shampoo per wash) will give us the total number of washes with 1 pump per wash.

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Now, we need to find the cost per pump. The bottle costs $24.00, and there are 240 washes (or pumps) in the bottle.

$24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:

$0.10 = 10 cents

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost for each street and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
Cost for Monica's street = 150 meters * $194/meter

Then, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
Cost for Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194/meter

Finally, we find the difference in cost:
Difference in cost = Cost for Lewis' street - Cost for Monica's street

Let's do the math:

Cost for Monica's street = 150 * 194 = $29,100
Cost for Lewis' street = 490 * 194 = $95,060

Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

For the first 5 months, the cost is straightforward:
5 months * $100,000 / 5 months = $100,000

The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the total duration of the research is:
5 months * 10 = 50 months

The additional months of research are:
50 months - 5 months = 45 months

The cost per month for the additional 45 months is 50% more than the initial monthly cost. The initial monthly cost is $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month. Therefore, the increased monthly cost is:
$20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month

The cost for the additional 45 months is:
45 months * $30,000 per month = $1,350,000

The total cost of the research is the sum of the initial 5 months and the additional 45 months:
$100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

The total cost of John's research is:
$1,450,000"
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat eaten by each player who ordered meat.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these up:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

So, the team consumed a total of 30 ounces of meat.

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loads Gary does per week.
2. Calculate the number of loads Gary does per year.
3. Calculate the total amount of water used per year.
4. Calculate the total cost of the water used per year.

Step 1: Number of loads per week
Gary does laundry twice a week, so he does 2 loads per week.

Step 2: Number of loads per year
There are 52 weeks in a year, so the number of loads per year is:
2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year

Step 3: Total amount of water used per year
Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used per year is:
104 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year

Step 4: Total cost of the water used per year
A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of the water used per year is:
2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

"To find out how much Scarlett spent, we need to add up the cost of all the items she bought.

The cost of the aquarium is $10.00.
The cost of the 2 bags of rocks is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
The cost of the 3 pieces of coral is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
The cost of the 20 fish is 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
The cost of the fish food is $2.00.

Now, we add all these costs together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00.

"To find out how many students were in the school auditorium, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium.
2. Determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators.
3. Calculate the number of remaining seats after the administrators have taken their seats.
4. Determine the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats.
5. Calculate the number of seats occupied by the students, which is the rest of the remaining seats.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Total number of seats in the auditorium:
   4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

2. Number of seats occupied by the administrators (one-fourth of the total seats):
   72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

3. Number of remaining seats after the administrators have taken their seats:
   72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

4. Number of seats occupied by the parents (one-third of the remaining seats):
   54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jim has a 20-pack of gum at the start of the day.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school.
4. He chews 1 piece after dinner.
5. So far, he has chewed 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.
6. This means he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum left before giving any to his sister.
7. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.
8. Therefore, at the end of the day, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

"To find out how many flowers have bloomed in Arianna's garden, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers planted in the garden.
2. Determine the fraction of flowers that have bloomed.
3. Multiply the total number of flowers by the fraction that have bloomed to find the number of bloomed flowers.

Step 1: Total number of flowers planted
Arianna has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, so the total number of flowers is:
10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Step 2: Fraction of flowers that have bloomed
4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed.

Step 3: Number of bloomed flowers
To find the number of bloomed flowers, we multiply the total number of flowers by the fraction that have bloomed:

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

Step 1: Convert kb per second to kb per hour.
There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.
Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second, so in one hour, she can download:
20 kb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72000 kb/hour

Step 2: Convert kb per hour to Mb per hour.
Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the total kb per hour by 1000 to get Mb per hour.
72000 kb/hour / 1000 kb/Mb = 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour.

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height, and then divide that by the rate at which he grows each year.

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the required height in inches is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam's current height is 40 inches. The difference between the required height and Adam's current height is:
48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches

Adam grows 2 inches a year, so the number of years it will take for him to grow the additional 8 inches is:
8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The price of a diamond jewel is given as $2000.
2. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. So, the price of a gold jewel is:
   \( \text{Price of Gold Jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Price of Diamond Jewel} \)
   \( \text{Price of Gold Jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 \)
   \( \text{Price of Gold Jewel} = 1600 \)

3. The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, the price of a silver jewel is:
   \( \text{Price of Silver Jewel} = \text{Price of Gold Jewel} - 400 \)
   \( \text{Price of Silver Jewel} = 1600 - 400 \)
   \( \text{Price of Silver Jewel} = 1200 \)

4. The total price for all three jewels is the sum of the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
   \( \text{Total Price} = \text{Price of Diamond Jewel} + \text{Price of Gold Jewel} + \text{Price of Silver Jewel} \)
   \( \text{Total Price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 \)

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. Since Tom is driving faster than Bob, we can find the difference in their speeds and then use that to find out how long it will take for Tom to make up the distance.

The difference in their speeds is:
70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph

This means Tom is gaining 15 miles on Bob every hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the rate at which Tom is gaining on Bob:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some. The total cost of the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total.

If Manny misses a class, the cost per class for the attended classes will increase. We need to find the point at which the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). The number of classes he will attend is \( 10 - x \). The cost per class when he misses \( x \) classes is \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the largest \( x \) such that \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \).

Solving the inequality:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

\[ 10x \leq 40 \]

\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes and the cost per class will still be $10 or less. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class will exceed $10, and his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to determine how many customers Julie can process daily, and then we can calculate the total for both of them for the week.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes:

50 customers/day * 2 = 100 customers/day

Now, we can calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:

50 customers/day (Jewel) + 100 customers/day (Julie) = 150 customers/day

Since they work all days of the week, we multiply the daily total by 7 to get the weekly total:

150 customers/day * 7 days/week = 1050 customers/week

The total weekly production for the two is:

3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so if we let L represent the number of miles Lynn ran, then Reggie ran L + 3 miles.

Since we know Reggie ran 20 miles, we can set up the equation:

L + 3 = 20

Now we solve for L:

L = 20 - 3
L = 17

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to calculate the volume of the hole and then multiply that by the time it takes him to shovel a cubic foot of earth.

The volume of the hole is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth:

Volume = Length × Width × Depth
Volume = 6 feet × 4 feet × 3 feet
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time to dig the hole is:

Total time = Volume × Time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 cubic feet × 3 seconds/cubic foot
Total time = 216 seconds

To convert the time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

Total time in minutes = 216 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute
Total time in minutes = 3.6 minutes

However, since the question asks for the final numerical answer and it is typically expected in the base unit used for the time per cubic foot (which is seconds in this case), we will provide the answer in seconds.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500
6. Towing package: The cost of the towing package is not specified, so we will assume it is included in the ""several added features"" and needs to be accounted for. However, since the cost is not provided, we cannot include it in the calculation without additional information.

"To calculate Tim's new annual salary after the promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new monthly salary after the 5% raise.
2. Calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary based on the new salary.
3. Calculate the total annual salary, which is the sum of the 12 months of the new salary and the bonus.

Step 1: New monthly salary after 5% raise
New monthly salary = Original monthly salary + (5% of original monthly salary)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + (0.05 * $20,000)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000
New monthly salary = $21,000

Step 2: Calculate the bonus
Bonus = 0.5 * New monthly salary
Bonus = 0.5 * $21,000
Bonus = $10,500

Step 3: Calculate the total annual salary
Total annual salary = (New monthly salary * 12) + Bonus
Total annual salary = ($21,000 * 12) + $10,500
Total annual salary = $252,000 + $10,500
Total annual salary = $262,500

So, Tim will make $262,500 in a year.

"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of the suits, the dress pants, and the dress shirts, and then add them all together.

1. The cost of the suits:
10 suits * $750/suit = $7500

2. The cost of the dress pants:
The dress pants cost 1/5 the cost of a suit, so:
$750/suit / 5 = $150/pair of dress pants
10 pairs of dress pants * $150/pair = $1500

3. The cost of the dress shirts:
He buys 3 dress shirts per suit, so:
10 suits * 3 dress shirts/suit = 30 dress shirts
30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800

Now, we add the costs together to get the total:
$7500 (suits) + $1500 (dress pants) + $1800 (dress shirts) = $10800

The total cost of everything is:
$10800"

"To find out how much flour was in three bags in total before it was divided into portions, we first need to determine how much flour was in one bag. Since one bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag as follows:

1 portion = 2 kilograms
8 portions = 8 * 2 kilograms

Now, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by 3 to find out how much flour was in three bags:

Total flour in 3 bags = 3 * (8 * 2) kilograms

Let's do the calculation:

Total flour in 3 bags = 3 * 16 kilograms
Total flour in 3 bags = 48 kilograms

"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

The formula to calculate distance is:
Distance = Speed × Time

For Alisa:
Distance_A = Speed_A × Time_A
Distance_A = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours
Distance_A = 54 miles

For Stanley:
Distance_S = Speed_S × Time_S
Distance_S = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours
Distance_S = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to get the total distance:
Total_Distance = Distance_A + Distance_S
Total_Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total_Distance = 79 miles

"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, and then add these times together.

First, we calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

Next, we calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so his rate is 4 feet per hour / 2 = 2 feet per hour.
- He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time to dig through the soil and the time to dig through the clay to get the total time:
- Total time = Time through soil + Time through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for Clara and Sheila, taking into account the discounts and vouchers.

First, let's calculate the cost for Clara:

- Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
- The total cost before the voucher is 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranate = $400.
- She got a $2 off voucher, so the final cost for Clara is $400 - $2 = $398.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Sheila:

- Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at the new price of $30 each.
- The total cost before the discount is 20 pomegranates * $30/pomegranate = $600.
- The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is 10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60.
- The final cost for Sheila after the discount is $600 - $60 = $540.

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid:

- The difference is $540 (Sheila's cost) - $398 (Clara's cost) = $142.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
2. The sales from green hats were twice the sales from red hats, so the sales from green hats were $400 * 2 = $800.
3. The total sales for the first month are the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.
4. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month, so the sales for the second month were $1200 * 3/4 = $900.
5. The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the sales from the first and second months, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"To calculate the total cost James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to consider the following:

- The total time hired is from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours.
- He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.
- The first paid hour costs $15.
- Each hour after the first is twice the cost of the previous hour.

Let's break down the cost:

1. First hour: $15
2. Second hour: $15 * 2 = $30
3. Third hour: $30 * 2 = $60

Now, we add up the costs for the paid hours:

$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105

So, the total amount James paid is:

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed for the guests.
2. Determine the number of whole eggs required based on the number of deviled egg halves.
3. Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Total number of deviled egg halves needed
Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
Total deviled egg halves = 3 halves/guest * 16 guests = 48 halves

Step 2: Number of whole eggs required
Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we can find the number of whole eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.
Number of whole eggs = 48 halves / 2 halves/egg = 24 eggs

Step 3: Convert whole eggs to dozens
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the number of whole eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
Number of dozens = 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

Total pages to read: 200 pages
Pages read per day: 10 pages/day

Number of days to complete the book: 200 pages / 10 pages/day = 20 days

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we can find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish by subtracting the number of days it will take him to read the book from the total number of days available.

Days before the deadline: 30 days - 20 days = 10 days

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rental: $5,000
3. Monthly fuel expenses: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost (hanger rental + fuel expenses) and then multiply by 12 to get the annual maintenance cost.

Monthly maintenance cost: $5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000
Annual maintenance cost: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year.

Total cost for the first year: $150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (maintenance) = $330,000

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We know that the total number of legs is 70, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We also know that the total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

Now we can solve this system of equations. We can start by solving the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, we substitute \( G \) in the first equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

20% of $5 = 0.20 * $5 = $1

So the more expensive brand costs:
$5 + $1 = $6 per pound

For 7 pounds, the cost is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
Kassidy's money = $90

2. Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. We know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.

Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
Rayna's money = $90 + $60
Rayna's money = $150

3. Now we can calculate the total amount of money they have together.

Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
Total money = $360

4. Finally, we need to find out how much each person would have if they shared the total amount equally.

Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = $360 / 3
Money per person = $120

So, if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, each would have $120.

Since a month typically has 30 or 31 days, and we are considering a 30-day period, we have already accounted for 30 + 3 = 33 days. However, since we are only interested in the good days left in the month, we need to consider only the 30-day period.

The question asks for the number of good days left in the month after the next three days. Since the month has 30 days and we have already accounted for 33 days (30 past days + 3 next days), there are no days left in the month. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 0.

Now, we solve for \( S \):

\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the growth rate is given in inches per day, we will convert the initial height from feet to inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, the initial height of the bamboo is:

The target height is 600 inches. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

The total growth needed is:
600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, so the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches is:
360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we add up all the cookies to find the total:

Katarina's cookies: 68
Max's cookies: 73
Cookie Monster's cookies: 61
Summer's cookies: 96

Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96

Let's calculate the total:

Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"To find the original length of the dress, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5L \). She also adds an additional 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. The final length of the dress is the sum of the original length, the 50% extension, and the 20 cm lace trim, which is given as 140 cm.

So the equation is:

\[ L + 0.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the terms with \( L \):

\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ L = 80 \]

So the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Chris to mow half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, and then add the two times together.

First, we need to find out how long it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode.

In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, to mow half the lawn, it would take him half the time:
60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes

In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, to mow half the lawn, it would take him:
40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for each half together to get the total time:
30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn using both modes.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now we can substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 44 - 14 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now that we have the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin:

\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo, we first need to determine the cost of one candy.

We know that:
- Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20.
- Each lollipop costs $0.40.

First, we calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Now we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the four candies:
$3.20 total cost - $2.00 cost of lollipops = $1.20 cost of four candies

Next, we find the cost of one candy:
$1.20 cost of four candies / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00
10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Finally, we add the cost of the 10 lollipops and the 10 candies to get the total cost:
$4.00 cost of 10 lollipops + $3.00 cost of 10 candies = $7.00

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we calculate the additional amount Neil saves over Rong's 20 coins and then add that to Rong's savings to get Neil's total monthly savings.

Rong's monthly savings: 20 coins
Neil's additional monthly savings: 20 coins * 2/5 = 8 coins
Neil's total monthly savings: 20 coins + 8 coins = 28 coins

Now, we need to calculate the total savings for both Rong and Neil over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Rong's total savings over ten years: 20 coins/month * 120 months = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings over ten years: 28 coins/month * 120 months = 3360 coins

Finally, we add both of their savings to get the total number of coins they have after ten years.

Total savings: 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the cost of the vaccines:
   - 2 vaccines at $20 each: 2 * $20 = $40

2. Let the total bill be T. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so:
   - Heartworm check cost: 0.60 * T

3. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
   - T = $40 + 0.60 * T

4. To find T, we need to solve the equation for T:
   - T - 0.60 * T = $40
   - 0.40 * T = $40
   - T = $40 / 0.40
   - T = $100

5. Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can calculate how much John leaves with:
   - Amount John brought: $125
   - Amount John leaves with: $125 - $100 = $25

So, John leaves with $25.

"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

1. The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, so:
   Cost of one banana = 2 * $0.5 = $1.0

2. The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so:
   Cost of one orange = 3 * $1.0 = $3.0

3. Now we can calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
   - Total cost of bananas = 5 bananas * $1.0/banana = $5.0
   - Total cost of apples = 12 apples * $0.5/apple = $6.0
   - Total cost of oranges = 7 oranges * $3.0/orange = $21.0

4. Finally, we sum up the total costs to get the price of the crate:
   Total price of the crate = $5.0 + $6.0 + $21.0 = $32.0

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of chairs required for the function and compare it to the number of chairs Mia's restaurant currently has.

First, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed:
- There are 42 adults, and each adult will need a regular chair.
- There are 15 babies, and each baby will need a high chair.

Total chairs needed = 42 (for adults) + 15 (for babies) = 57 chairs

Next, let's determine how many chairs the restaurant currently has:
- The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
- The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, so it has 5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs.

Total chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48 chairs

Now, we can find out how many more chairs are needed:
Chairs needed - Chairs available = 57 - 48 = 9 chairs

Mia has to get 9 more chairs.

2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find out how many points Betty has, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points:
   Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points)
   Betty's points = 50 + (0.30 * 50)
   Betty's points = 50 + 15
   Betty's points = 65
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty:
   Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
   Tom's points = 65 - 30
   Tom's points = 35
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom:
   Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points
   Martha's points = 3 * 35
   Martha's points = 105

Now, let's add up all the points collected by the students:
Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Martha's points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105
Total points = 255

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points, so the class is missing:

- The fixed cost to go picking is $20.
- The cost per pound of blueberries picked is $1.5.
- The total cost for the blueberries picked is 30 pounds * $1.5/pound.

Total cost of picking = Fixed cost + (Cost per pound * Number of pounds)
Total cost of picking = $20 + (30 * $1.5)

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries at the store:
- The cost per pound at the store is $2.5.
- The total cost for the blueberries bought is 30 pounds * $2.5/pound.

   30 people receive interviews, and 20% receive a job offer.
   30 * 20% = 30 * 0.20 = 6 people receive a job offer.

3. Finally, we calculate how many of those who receive a job offer accept the position:
   6 people receive a job offer, and a third of them accept the position.
   6 * (1/3) = 6 * 0.333... ≈ 2 people accept the position.

So, the number of people who accept the position is 2.

"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of taps for the right foot:
- For the 3 minutes with her arms at her sides, she taps at 300 taps per minute.
- For the 2 minutes with her arms raised, she taps at 200 taps per minute.

Right foot taps:
(3 minutes * 300 taps/minute) + (2 minutes * 200 taps/minute) = 900 taps + 400 taps = 1300 taps

Next, we calculate the number of taps for the left foot:
- For the 3 minutes with her arms at her sides, she taps at 250 taps per minute.
- For the 2 minutes with her arms raised, she taps at 200 taps per minute.

Left foot taps:
(3 minutes * 250 taps/minute) + (2 minutes * 200 taps/minute) = 750 taps + 400 taps = 1150 taps

Now, we add the taps from both feet to get the combined total:
1300 taps (right foot) + 1150 taps (left foot) = 2450 taps

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of the damage to his car if the pothole is not fixed and compare it to the cost of fixing the pothole himself, including the fine and the cost of the asphalt.

Cost of damage to car if pothole is not fixed: $450
Cost of the fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 * $25 = $75

Total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself: $120 + $75 = $195

Money saved by fixing the pothole: $450 - $195 = $255

"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

The restaurant originally has:
- 170 normal chairs
- 23 baby chairs

The number of chairs sent for repair is:
- 20 normal chairs
- 13 baby chairs

Now, we subtract the chairs sent for repair from the original number of chairs:

Normal chairs left: 170 - 20 = 150
Baby chairs left: 23 - 13 = 10

Total chairs left: 150 + 10 = 160

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of slices each person ate and then subtract that from the total number of slices available.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they each ate:
2/3 * 12 = 8 slices

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, so they each ate:
3/4 * 12 = 9 slices

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends:
3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices

And the total number of slices eaten by the other two friends:
2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices

The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is:
24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Since there were 5 pizzas and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices available was:
5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices

Finally, to find out how many slices were left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices available:
60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

"To solve this problem, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages.

First, we know that the cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages.

The dog takes 2/3 the time the cat takes, so we calculate the dog's time as follows:
Dog's time = 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, to find the average time, we add the cat's time and the dog's time and divide by 2 (since there are two animals):

Average time = (Cat's time + Dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

Topher's shoe length in inches is:
8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. We can set up the following equation to represent this relationship, where \( b \) is the length of Bobby's shoe in inches:

100 inches = 9 * b + 10 inches

Now we solve for \( b \):

100 inches - 10 inches = 9 * b
90 inches = 9 * b
b = 90 inches / 9
b = 10 inches

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find out how many windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in the students' cars and the teachers' cars separately, and then add those numbers together.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- The total number of windows in the students' cars is 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.
- A quarter of the students' cars' windows is 256 windows * 1/4 = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.
- The total number of windows in the teachers' cars is 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.
- Three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows is 64 windows * 3/4 = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in the students' cars to the number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students' windows) + 48 (teachers' windows) = 112 windows.

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools together and then divide by the total number of spools. After that, we multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Number of blue spools = Number of light blue spools + Number of dark blue spools
Number of blue spools = 15 + 45
Number of blue spools = 60

Total number of spools = Number of light blue spools + Number of dark blue spools + Number of light green spools + Number of dark green spools
Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50
Total number of spools = 150

Percentage of blue spools = (Number of blue spools / Total number of spools) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 0.4 * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 40

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday.
2. Subtract the number of people who voted by midday from the total to find the number of people who had not voted by midday.
3. Calculate the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00.
4. Subtract the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00 from the number of people who had not voted by midday to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Number of people who voted by midday:
   \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 5000 = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \)

2. Number of people who had not voted by midday:
   5000 - 2000 = 3000

3. Number of people who voted between midday and 16:00:
   \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining 3000 = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \)

4. Number of people who had not voted by 16:00:

"To find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we need to calculate the total number of smores that will be made and then determine how many sleeves are required to make that many smores.

First, let's calculate the total number of smores the kids will eat:
9 kids * 2 smores per kid = 18 smores

Next, let's calculate the total number of smores the adults will eat:
6 adults * 1 smore per adult = 6 smores

Now, let's add the smores for kids and adults to get the total number of smores:
18 smores (kids) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, so we need to find out how many sleeves are required for 24 smores:
24 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we can now determine how many boxes are needed:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dora's age is given as 15 years old.
2. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, Dora's father's age is 2 * 15 + 8.
3. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so we subtract 4 from Dora's father's age to get Dora's mother's age.
4. We then add up the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother to get the total combined age.

Let's calculate:

Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 years old
Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years old

Now, we add up all their ages:

Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34

Total combined age = 87

"To find out how many votes candidate C received, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of votes candidate A received.
2. Calculate the number of votes candidate B received, which is 50% more than candidate A's votes.
3. Subtract the votes of candidates A and B from the total number of votes to find the votes for candidate C.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received:
   20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes

2. Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. So, candidate B received:
   50% of 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes more than candidate A
   Therefore, candidate B received:
   20 votes + 10 votes = 30 votes

3. The total number of votes is 100. Subtract the votes of candidates A and B to find the votes for candidate C:
   100 votes - 20 votes (A) - 30 votes (B) = 50 votes

Candidate C received 50 votes.

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

Beck's apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's apples = 100 - 23
Beck's apples = 77

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, we need to adjust the number of apples each has:

Boris's new number of apples = Boris's original apples - 10
Boris's new number of apples = 100 - 10
Boris's new number of apples = 90

Beck's new number of apples = Beck's original apples + 10
Beck's new number of apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new number of apples = 87

Now we can find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the transaction:

Fewer apples = Boris's new number of apples - Beck's new number of apples
Fewer apples = 90 - 87
Fewer apples = 3

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water he uses for the ice cubes and then subtract that from the 32 ounces he started with.

First, we calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
3 giant cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces

Next, we calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
7 medium cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces

Then, we calculate the water used for the small cubes:
8 small cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Now, we add up the water used for all the cubes:
12 ounces (giant) + 14 ounces (medium) + 4 ounces (small) = 30 ounces

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

So, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the number of books each person has in terms of Steven's books.

Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.

According to the problem:
- Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has \( S + 6 \) books.
- Clara has two times as many books as Steven, so Clara has \( 2S \) books.

We are given that Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S = 20 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{20}{2} \]
\[ S = 10 \]

Now we know that Steven has 10 books. We can find out how many books Alice has:
\[ S + 6 = 10 + 6 \]
\[ S + 6 = 16 \]

Alice has 16 books. We already know that Clara has 20 books. To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and that it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now that we know the cost of both a gallon jar and a half-gallon jar, we can calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Total cost of 10 gallon jars = 10 * Cost of a gallon jar
Total cost of 10 gallon jars = 10 * $5
Total cost of 10 gallon jars = $50

Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * Cost of a half-gallon jar
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Total amount spent = Total cost of 10 gallon jars + Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total amount spent = $50 + $48
Total amount spent = $98

2. Subtract the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games.

Step 1: The number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:
2 * 5 = 10

Step 2: Now, we can subtract the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students:

Next, we need to find out how many of those students are girls. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can calculate the number of girls in one class as follows:

40% of 40 students = 0.40 * 40 = 16 girls

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the class:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
2. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 27, so she trades 27 small stickers.
3. Since a small sticker is worth one small button, and a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons for her 27 small stickers.
4. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 20, so she trades 20 large stickers.
5. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons for her 20 large stickers.
6. She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left, which she trades for small buttons.
7. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons for her 20 large stickers.
8. She has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left, which she does not trade.
9. In total, she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons.
10. Since a large button is worth three small buttons, we can convert all her buttons to small buttons to get the total number of buttons she has.
11. 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.
12. Adding the 60 small buttons she has, she has a total of 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.
13. She also has 3 small stickers left, which are worth 3 small buttons.

So, the total number of buttons (in terms of small buttons) she has by the end is 147 + 3 = 150.

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, so we can write:

\[ F = 2A \]

Since the total number of people on the council is 33, the sum of the votes in favor and against must be 33:

\[ F + A = 33 \]

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second one:

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now that we know the number of votes against the regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor:

\[ F = 2A \]
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

So the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break down the information given:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, so:
   \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \) students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so:
   \( 22 - 4 = 18 \) students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so:
   \( 18 / 2 = 9 \) students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so:
   \( 9 + 6 = 15 \) students need size extra-large.

Now, we add up all the shirts needed for each size:

\( 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 \)

Krissa needs to order 75 shirts in total.

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can work backwards from the information given.

First, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. This means that the total number of Pomeranians is three times the number of Pomeranian girls, because 1/3 of the Pomeranians = 6, so:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3 = 18

Next, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If 18 is two thirds of the total number of puppies, then we can find the total number of puppies by dividing the number of Pomeranians by 2 and then multiplying by 3:

Total Puppies = (18 / 2) * 3 = 9 * 3 = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem, the second house will need twice as many cases as the first house, which is \( 2x \), and the third house will need double the amount of the first house, which is \( 2x \) as well.

The total number of cases for all three houses is 250, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so it will need:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To find out how many fruits George has in total, we first need to calculate the number of pears he has based on the information that he has 45% more pears than bananas.

If George has 200 bananas, and he has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + (45% of Number of bananas)
Number of pears = 200 + (0.45 * 200)
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to consider her hourly rate and the additional daily rate if she teaches more than 3 classes.

On Monday:
- She teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3, so she gets an additional $5 for the day.
- She works for 5 hours at $15 per hour, so her earnings for the hours worked are 5 * $15 = $75.
- Adding the additional daily rate, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday:
- She teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3, so she does not get the additional $5 for the day.
- She works for 2 hours at $15 per hour, so her earnings for the hours worked are 2 * $15 = $30.
- Since she does not qualify for the additional daily rate, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Adding the earnings from both days:
- Total earnings = Monday's earnings + Wednesday's earnings = $80 + $30 = $110.

Therefore, Tanya earned $110 for these two days of teaching.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he makes from selling the eggplants and then determine how much more he needs to make from the corn to reach his goal of $135.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total from the eggplants is:
20 eggplants * $3/eggplant = $60

Bennet's goal is to make $135 in total. So the amount he still needs to make from selling the corn is:
$135 - $60 = $75

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell, so the price per ear of corn should be:
$75 / 25 ears of corn = $3/ear of corn

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time spent driving to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, we calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum:
- Distance to the museum: 150 miles
- Speed: 75 mph

Time to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since the trip back is the same distance and speed, the time to drive back is also 2 hours.

Now, we add the time spent at the museum:
- Time spent at the museum: 6 hours

Total time gone from home = Time to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum + Time to drive back
Total time gone from home = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours

"To find the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they covered while driving and the distance they covered while hiking.

First, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours minus the 1.5 hours they spent hiking, which is 4.5 hours. They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

Distance driven = Time driven * Speed driven
Distance driven = 4.5 hours * 50 miles/hour
Distance driven = 225 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 25 miles per hour, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 20 miles per hour.

Distance hiked = Time hiked * Speed hiked
Distance hiked = 1.5 hours * 20 miles/hour
Distance hiked = 30 miles

Now, we can add the distance driven and the distance hiked to find the total distance to the vacation spot.

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
Total distance = 225 miles + 30 miles
Total distance = 255 miles

"To determine the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points for each of the three categories (enemies, berries, and time) and then find the total for each player.

Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as E, the number of berries she collects as B, and the time she has left on the timer as T (in seconds).

Ava's points:
- Enemies: (E + 8) * 10
- Berries: (B + 3) * 5
- Time: (T - 4) * 30

Emma's points:
- Enemies: E * 10
- Berries: B * 5
- Time: T * 30

Now, let's calculate the difference in points for each category:

Difference in points from enemies:
- (E + 8) * 10 - E * 10 = 8 * 10 = 80

Difference in points from berries:
- (B + 3) * 5 - B * 5 = 3 * 5 = 15

Difference in points from time:
- (T - 4) * 30 - T * 30 = -4 * 30 = -120

Total difference in points:
- 80 (enemies) + 15 (berries) - 120 (time) = -25

The difference between their two scores is -25, which means Emma's score is 25 points higher than Ava's.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying more fish, he had a total of:
- 3 + (number of orange fish bought) orange fish
- 4 + (number of white fish bought) white fish

We know that after buying the fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of orange fish bought as O and the number of white fish bought as W. We can set up the following equation based on the information given:

3 + O = 2 * (4 + W)

We also know that Bob bought a total of 17 fish, so:

O + W = 17

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) 3 + O = 2 * (4 + W)
2) O + W = 17

Let's solve the system of equations. First, we can simplify equation 1:

3 + O = 8 + 2W
O = 2W + 5

Now we can substitute O from the second equation:

2W + 5 + W = 17
3W + 5 = 17
3W = 12
W = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of groups formed.
2. Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups.

Step 1: Determine the total number of groups formed.
Since 90 people are split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9 to get the total number of groups:
90 / 9 = 10 groups

Step 2: Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.
3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, so we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
3. Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months (3) to get the total amount paid after three months.

Step 1: Total number of employees after three months
Initial number of employees: 200
Number of new employees hired each month: 20
Number of months: 3

Total number of new employees hired in three months: 20 * 3 = 60
Total number of employees after three months: 200 + 60 = 260

Step 2: Total monthly salary for all employees
Monthly salary per employee: $4000
Total monthly salary for all employees: 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000

Step 3: Total amount paid after three months
Total amount paid after three months: $1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

$3,120,000"
"To find out how long the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total time for singing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and ""Jingle Bells"" once.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, and they will sing it twice, so:
150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long, and they will sing it once, so:
240 seconds * 1 = 240 seconds

Now, we add the time for both songs together to get the total caroling time:
300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds

Therefore, the choir will be caroling for 540 seconds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Billy's initial hourly rate: $10.00
2. After 2 months, Billy's hourly rate increased by $0.50, making it: $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50
3. On his first anniversary, Billy's hourly rate increased by $1.00, making it: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50

Sally's starting hourly rate is $0.50 more than Billy's starting rate, which was $10.00, so:
4. Sally's hourly rate: $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50

Now, we calculate how much each of them earns for 20 hours of work:
5. Billy's earnings for 20 hours: $11.50 * 20 = $230.00
6. Sally's earnings for 20 hours: $10.50 * 20 = $210.00

Finally, we find out how much more Billy earns than Sally:
7. Difference in earnings: $230.00 - $210.00 = $20.00

So, Billy will earn $20.00 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.

"To find out how many points Nikita scored, we first need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 to it.

Half of Pierson's score is:
278 / 2 = 139

Nikita scored 11 more than this, so:
139 + 11 = 150

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their individual scores together:

The total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To find out how many trees will be planted at the end of the campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students each.
- So, the total number of students is 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students.
- Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000 trees.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes with 3 teachers each.
- So, the total number of teachers is 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

Now, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees = Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers
- Total trees = 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees.

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her collection, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14 stuffed animals.

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of the total, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x - 0.30 \times x = 0.30 \times 14 \]
\[ 0.70 \times x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats to make them 30% of her collection.

"Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so for 2 weeks, that's 14 days. Half an hour is 0.5 hours, so:

0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. That's 7 days, so:

2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours

Adding the two amounts together gives us the total hours played:

7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

Kris is trying to earn an achievement for playing a total of 30 hours, so the number of hours she still needs to play is:

30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car will travel in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, the two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours.

"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials and then add the 30% premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. So, the total cost of the materials is:

$600 (diamond) + $300 (gold) = $900

Next, we calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials:

30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the materials to find out the final amount James paid:

$900 (materials) + $270 (premium) = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring.

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, we calculate the pass rate for each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed, which is a pass rate of 340/500.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed, which is a pass rate of 40/100.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. Since there are 400 fifth graders, the number who passed is 400 * (80/100) = 320.

Now, we calculate the total number of students and the total number of students who passed:

- Total students: 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000 students.
- Total passed: 340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 320 (fifth graders) = 700 students.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

Overall pass rate = 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, divide the total square inches by 3 to find the length in inches.

Let's start with step 1:

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips.
Total number of glass chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

Step 2:

It takes 12 glass chips to make 1 square inch of the mosaic.
Total square inches of mosaic = Total number of glass chips / 12 chips per square inch
Total square inches of mosaic = 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Step 3:

The mosaic is 3 inches tall, so to find the length, we divide the total square inches by the height.
Length of the mosaic = Total square inches / Height in inches
Length of the mosaic = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea that was consumed and then add the 10 quarts that were left over. After that, we convert the total quarts to gallons, knowing that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students who each drank 1.5 quarts:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Next, we calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students who each drank 2 quarts:
16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, we add the tea consumed by all the students together:
6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

Then, we add the 10 quarts that were left over to find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party:
38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Finally, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month, starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, and doubling the number of students at the end of each month. We will then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

Let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month:

- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, to find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students (10) from the number of students at the end of May (320).

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to know how many days he worked during the week. A typical week has 7 days. We can then divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch to find out the total number of branches he climbed during the week. After that, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

Let's do the math:

1. Total money made: $105
2. Cost per branch: $0.25
3. Total branches climbed in the week: $105 / $0.25
4. Number of days in a week: 7
5. Average branches climbed per day: (Total branches climbed in the week) / 7

Now, let's calculate:

Total branches climbed in the week = $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Average branches climbed per day = 420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals for each type of flower Rose picked, subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped, and then sum the remaining petals.

1. For the first set of flowers, she picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals

2. For the second set of flowers, she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals

3. For the third set of flowers, she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals

4. For the last set of flowers, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals

Now, we add up all the petals:
15 petals + 24 petals + 20 petals + 42 petals = 101 petals

Since she dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals of one flower from each set:
1 flower * 5 petals/flower = 5 petals
1 flower * 6 petals/flower = 6 petals
1 flower * 4 petals/flower = 4 petals
1 flower * 7 petals/flower = 7 petals

Total petals from the dropped flowers:
5 petals + 6 petals + 4 petals + 7 petals = 22 petals

Subtract the petals of the dropped flowers from the total:
101 petals - 22 petals = 79 petals

The total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent by Jack and his three friends playing the arcade games for 4 hours.

First, let's determine how long each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes with one quarter.

Next, we need to calculate how many quarters each person will use in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
- Two friends: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters each
- One friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Now, we calculate the total number of quarters used:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: 24 quarters each, so 24 * 2 = 48 quarters
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used = 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is:
68 quarters * $0.25 per quarter = $17.00

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest, so \( s = 2z \).

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:

\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:

\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), we can substitute \( 2z \) for \( s \) in the equation:

\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now that we know \( z = 1 \), we can find \( s \):

\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

And the amount of oil is:

\[ 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

In the second game, we need to determine how many points Julie scored in the first game to find out how many points Sasha scored. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so:

Julie's points in the first game = Sasha's points in the first game - 4
Julie's points in the first game = 14 - 4
Julie's points in the first game = 10

Now, Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game, so:

Sasha's points in the second game = Julie's points in the first game - 6
Sasha's points in the second game = 10 - 6
Sasha's points in the second game = 4

Now we can add the points from both games to find the total points Sasha scored:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the terms with \( P \):

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick has:

\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And finally, we can find out how many cards Becca has:

"To calculate how much money Milly will lose, we need to consider the cost of shipping the book back and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
- The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
- The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.

Shipping cost for weight = 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
Shipping cost for distance = 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Next, let's calculate the refund amount:
- The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.

Refund amount = $32 * 75% = $32 * 0.75 = $24.00

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
- Milly will lose the difference between the book's cost and the refund, plus the shipping cost.

Total loss = (Book cost - Refund amount) + Shipping cost
Total loss = ($32 - $24) + $3.00
Total loss = $8.00 + $3.00
Total loss = $11.00

Milly will lose $11.00.

288 minutes (recording) + 480 minutes (writing songs) + 360 minutes (makeup) = 1128 minutes.

To convert the total time into hours and minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
1128 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 18 hours and 48 minutes.

However, since the question asks for the final numerical answer in a separate line, we will provide the total time in minutes:

"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to determine the cost of the additional items she needs installed beyond what is included in the standard installation package.

The standard installation package includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves (not needed by Angela)
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Angela has:
- 6 mirrors (2 additional mirrors needed)
- 2 chandeliers (1 additional chandelier needed)
- 20 pictures (10 additional pictures needed)

The cost for additional items is $15.00 per item. So, we need to calculate the cost for the 2 additional mirrors, 1 additional chandelier, and 10 additional pictures.

The total number of additional items is:
2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 items

The cost for the additional items is:
13 items * $15.00/item = $195.00

Now, we add the cost of the additional items to the standard installation cost:
$129.00 (standard installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela will be:
$324.00

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more, we calculate 40% of Anthony's savings: 40% of $30.00 = 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00.
4. Therefore, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this, we need to calculate the height each person can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working our way up to Naruto.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 4 * 12 inches.

Now, let's calculate the final height in inches and then convert it to feet (1 foot = 12 inches).

Naruto's mountain height in inches:
10 * 4 * 12 = 480 inches

Now, convert inches to feet:
480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours, so he covers:

8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

After taking some rest, he continues his journey for another 6 hours, covering:

8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

To find the total distance traveled, we add the two distances together:

32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it would take for the turtles to travel the same distance.

First, let's establish the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance is the same for one kangaroo, as they are traveling at the same speed. Therefore, one kangaroo would also take 18 hours to travel the same distance.

Now, if a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it would take twice as long for a turtle to cover the same distance. So, one turtle would take 18 hours * 2 = 36 hours to travel across the highway.

Since we have four turtles, and they are all traveling at the same speed, the time it takes for them to travel the distance is not affected by their number, as they are not helping each other to travel faster. Each turtle will still take 36 hours to travel the distance individually.

Therefore, it will take 36 hours for one turtle, and consequently, it will also take 36 hours for four turtles to travel across the highway, as they are not traveling together in a way that would reduce the time.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, to find out how many dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes = Total dishes
20 + 40 + 80 = 140

So, together they made 140 clay dishes.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after the trade-in, her part-time job pay, and her mom's contribution, and then subtract the amount she still needs to buy the laptop.

The cost of the new laptop is $600, but with the trade-in, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is:

$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom is giving her $80, so the total amount from these sources is:

$150 + $80 = $230

Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she is $50 short of the $400 needed. Therefore, the amount she has, including the money in her purse, is:

$400 - $50 = $350

Now, to find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we subtract the amount she received from her job and her mom from the total amount she has:

$350 - $230 = $120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from slicing the apples and then subtract the number of slices he eats.

First, we calculate the number of slices from the large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Next, we calculate the number of slices from the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract that from the total number of slices:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

The number of apple slices left is:

"The farmer currently has 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk a day, for a total of 15 liters of milk a day (3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters/day).

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can calculate the total number of cows needed by dividing the desired daily milk production by the amount of milk one cow can produce:

25 liters/day ÷ 5 liters/cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, he needs 5 cows - 3 cows = 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the remaining length is 12 * 2/3 = 8 millimeters.
3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the remaining length is 12 * 1/2 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the remaining lengths together:

2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we need to find out how many students are good at both subjects. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students.

Total number of students = 20
Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8

Number of students good at both = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
Number of students good at both = 20 - (5 + 8)
Number of students good at both = 20 - 13
Number of students good at both = 7

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the number of students who are good at math only to the number of students who are good at both:

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both
Total number of students good at math = 5 + 7
Total number of students good at math = 12

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group will take, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage. We also need to account for the intermission.

Each group will take:
2 minutes to get on stage
6 minutes to perform
2 minutes to exit the stage
Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. We need to subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the performances.

Total performance time available = 120 minutes - 10 minutes (intermission) = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the total performance time available by the time each group takes to find out how many groups can perform.

Number of groups = Total performance time available / Time per group
Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group
Number of groups = 11

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to use the formula for simple interest:

\[ A = P(1 + rt) \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this case, the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which means \( r = \frac{3}{4} \) of \( P \) per year. However, the interest rate should be a fraction of the principal, not the principal itself. Since the interest is three-quarters of the original amount, the interest rate is actually 75% or 0.75.

Let's plug in the values:

- \( P = 300 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.75 \)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Now we can calculate the interest earned over 3 years:

\[ \text{Interest} = P \times r \times t = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 675 \]

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount:

\[ A = P + \text{Interest} = 300 + 675 \]

\[ A = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the number of white shirts with collars:
   Half of the 40 white shirts have collars, so 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts have collars.

2. Calculate the number of white shirts with no collars:
   Since 20 white shirts have collars, the remaining 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts have no collars.

3. Calculate the number of floral shirts with no buttons:
   There are 20 floral shirts with buttons, so out of the 50 floral shirts, 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts have no buttons.

4. Calculate the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars:
   30 (floral shirts with no buttons) - 20 (white shirts with no collars) = 10.

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for exponential growth, where the number of infected people each day is the number of infected people from the previous day multiplied by the number of people each infected person infects.

Let's denote the initial number of infected people as \( I_0 \), which is 10. Each day, each infected person infects 6 others, so the growth factor is 6.

The number of infected people after 1 day (\( I_1 \)) is:
\[ I_1 = I_0 \times 6 \]

The number of infected people after 2 days (\( I_2 \)) is:
\[ I_2 = I_1 \times 6 = I_0 \times 6^2 \]

The number of infected people after 3 days (\( I_3 \)) is:
\[ I_3 = I_2 \times 6 = I_0 \times 6^3 \]

Now we can calculate \( I_3 \):

\[ I_3 = 10 \times 216 \]
\[ I_3 = 2160 \]

So, after three days, 2160 people are infected.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Claire earns 1 badge every month.
2. Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months.
3. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 badges every month.

Now, let's calculate the number of badges each person earns in a year (12 months):

- Claire earns 1 badge/month * 12 months/year = 12 badges/year.
- Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months, so she earns 1/2 badge/month * 12 months/year = 6 badges/year.
- Wendy earns 3 badges/month * 12 months/year = 36 badges/year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

36 badges/year (Wendy) - 6 badges/year (Amber) = 30 badges/year.

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
2. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)

We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to find the value of \( F \).

First, we express \( S \) in terms of \( F \) using the second equation:

\( A = F - 12 \)

So,

\( S = (F - 12) + 25 \)
\( S = F + 13 \)

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in the third equation:

\( (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \)

Combine like terms:

\( 3F + 1 = 85 \)

Subtract 1 from both sides:

\( 3F = 84 \)

Divide by 3:

\( F = 28 \)

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much of the total grocery cost Keenan is responsible for. Since Madeline pays 60%, Keenan pays the remaining 40%.

The total monthly grocery cost is $400. So, Keenan's share of the monthly cost is 40% of $400.

Keenan's monthly cost = 40% of $400
Keenan's monthly cost = 0.40 * $400
Keenan's monthly cost = $160

Since there are four weeks in the month, we divide Keenan's monthly cost by 4 to find the weekly cost.

Keenan's weekly cost = Keenan's monthly cost / 4
Keenan's weekly cost = $160 / 4
Keenan's weekly cost = $40

"To find out how many pieces of pizza Tobias has eaten so far, we need to calculate the amount he ate each day and then sum those amounts.

First, we calculate how many pieces he ate on the first day:
2/5 of 60 pieces = (2/5) * 60 = 24 pieces

Next, we know he ate 10 pieces on the second day.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days:
60 pieces - 24 pieces (first day) - 10 pieces (second day) = 26 pieces remaining

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces:
7/13 of 26 pieces = (7/13) * 26 = 14 pieces

Finally, we sum the pieces he ate over the three days:
24 pieces (first day) + 10 pieces (second day) + 14 pieces (third day) = 48 pieces

So, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far.

"To find out how much 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water will cost, we need to calculate the cost per bottle for each and then multiply by the number of bottles David wants to buy.

First, let's find the cost per bottle of soda:
7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, so 1 bottle of soda costs $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

Next, let's find the cost per bottle of water:
4 bottles of water cost $8.00, so 1 bottle of water costs $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda will cost 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
2 bottles of water will cost 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we first need to determine her hourly rate. We can do this by dividing the total amount she earned by the number of hours she worked.

Ella's hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours
Ella's hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Ella's hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can calculate how much she would earn after 12 hours.

Earnings after 12 hours = Hourly rate * Number of hours
Earnings after 12 hours = $11 * 12
Earnings after 12 hours = $132

"To calculate Amy's total score, we need to determine how many points she earns from each type of question and then sum them up.

For the multiple-choice questions:
- There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly.
- 80% of 10 is 0.80 * 10 = 8 questions.
- Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 * 1 = 8 points.

For the true/false questions:
- There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly.
- 90% of 20 is 0.90 * 20 = 18 questions.
- Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 * 1 = 18 points.

For the long-answer questions:
- There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly.
- 60% of 5 is 0.60 * 5 = 3 questions.
- Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, we add up the points from all the questions:
- Total points = points from multiple-choice + points from true/false + points from long-answer
- Total points = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

"To find out how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market for sale, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Subtract the profit from the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them.
Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5) = 180 chickens

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
Each chicken is sold for $50.
Total revenue = 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

Step 3: Subtract the profit from the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.
Profit = $2000
Cost of the chickens = Total revenue - Profit
Cost of the chickens = $9000 - $2000 = $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses the boys sold together.

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses (boys' sales combined)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the boys' sales by 2 to find out how many each boy sold.

18 glasses (boys' sales combined) / 2 = 9 glasses (each boy's sales)

Now we know that Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales.

14 glasses (Julie's sales) - 9 glasses (Micah's sales) = 5 glasses

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. The cost of doing her hair is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of doing her hair, so:
   \[ \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, so:
   \[ \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up the costs of all the services:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hair cost} + \text{Manicure cost} + \text{Pedicure cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 575 \]

So, Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling her rope.
2. Determine the length of the new rope she can buy with the money from the sale.
3. Calculate the cost of the new rope.
4. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money received from the sale to find out how much money she will have left over.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Sarah's rope is 20 meters long, and she sells it for $2 a meter.
   Total money from sale = 20 meters * $2/meter = $40

2. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, so we need to find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy with $40.
   Length of new rope = Total money from sale / Cost per meter of new rope
   Length of new rope = $40 / $1.5/meter = 26.666... meters

Since Sarah cannot buy a fraction of a meter of rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope.

3. The cost of the new rope is:
   Cost of new rope = 26 meters * $1.5/meter = $39

4. The money left over after buying the new rope is:
   Money left over = Total money from sale - Cost of new rope
   Money left over = $40 - $39 = $1

So, Sarah will have $1 left over after she buys the new rope.

"To solve the problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 10 from 18.

Current age of Melanie = 18 - 10 = 8 years old

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let's denote the number of years it will take for her age to be three times her current age as \( x \).

In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \). We want this to be three times her current age, which is 8, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and then subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon:
5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so each pack costs $10 / 5 = $2.

Next, the cost of the chicken:
Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet costs $2 * 2 = $4.
The total cost for 6 packets of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Now, the cost of the strawberries:
3 packs of strawberries cost 3 * $4 = $12.

And the cost of the apples:
Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack costs $4 / 2 = $2.
The total cost for 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
Total cost = cost of bacon + cost of chicken + cost of strawberries + cost of apples
Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14
Total cost = $60

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget to find out how much she has left:
Money left = Kelly’s budget - Total cost
Money left = $65 - $60
Money left = $5

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we need to subtract the 15-minute encore from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide the result by 2, since the final concert (excluding the encore) is twice as long as her usual concerts.

The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Subtracting the 15-minute encore gives us:

65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

This 50 minutes is twice the length of her usual concerts, so we divide by 2 to find the length of a usual concert:

50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the numbers together:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

"To find out how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange on the stage, we first need to determine how many microphones did not find any space to fit in. Since 20% of the microphones won't fit, we can calculate this number as follows:

20% of 50 microphones = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

These 10 microphones are the ones that couldn't be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that were paired is:

50 microphones - 10 microphones = 40 microphones

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is:

40 microphones / 2 microphones per pair = 20 pairs

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

2/3 * 6 = 4 birds flying overhead.

Then, we calculate the number of birds feeding, which is 3 groups of 8 birds each:
3 * 8 = 24 birds feeding.

Now, we add all the numbers together to get the total:
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying overhead) + 24 (feeding) = 34 birds in total.

"To find the speed at which a whirligig spins, we need to first determine the speed of a thingamabob, since the whirligig's speed is a multiple of the thingamabob's speed.

We know that:
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

Let's denote the speed of a thingamabob as \( T \) meters per second. Then, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11T \).

Since the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:
\[ 11T = 121 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ T = \frac{121}{11} \]
\[ T = 11 \]

Now that we know the thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob:
\[ \text{Whirligig speed} = 5T \]
\[ \text{Whirligig speed} = 5 \times 11 \]
\[ \text{Whirligig speed} = 55 \]

So, the whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( c \).

The cost of the salad is $6.
The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so it is \( \frac{6}{2} = $3 \).

Ellen eats two carrots, so the cost for the carrots is \( 2c \).

The total cost for her daily food is the sum of the cost of the two carrots, the salad, and the yogurt, which is \( 2c + 6 + 3 \).

We know that the total cost is $11, so we can write the equation as:
\[ 2c + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Now we can solve for \( c \):
\[ 2c + 9 = 11 \]
\[ 2c = 11 - 9 \]
\[ 2c = 2 \]
\[ c = \frac{2}{2} \]
\[ c = 1 \]

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"To calculate Mark's weekly earnings after the pay raise, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Mark's new hourly wage.
2. Calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week.
3. Multiply the new hourly wage by the total number of hours worked in a week.

Step 1: Mark's new hourly wage is his old wage plus the raise.
New hourly wage = Old hourly wage + Raise
New hourly wage = $10 + $2
New hourly wage = $12

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week.
Total hours per week = Hours per day * Days per week
Total hours per week = 8 hours/day * 5 days/week
Total hours per week = 40 hours/week

Step 3: Calculate Mark's weekly earnings.
Weekly earnings = New hourly wage * Total hours per week
Weekly earnings = $12/hour * 40 hours/week
Weekly earnings = $480/week

So, Mark makes $480 a week.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that amount from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

From the information given:
- The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
- The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, we can assume that the $6 is the total amount she earned from mowing Joe's lawn. Therefore, if she mowed Joe's lawn \( J \) times, and the total payment is $6, then the payment per mow for Joe's lawn is \( \frac{6}{J} \).

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is the sum of the payments for mowing Joe's, Kamala's, and Alba's lawns:
- Joe's lawn: \( J \times \frac{6}{J} = 6 \) dollars
- Kamala's lawn: \( 3J \times \frac{6}{J} = 18 \) dollars
- Alba's lawn: \( 5J \times \frac{6}{J} = 30 \) dollars

The total amount from mowing lawns is \( 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \) dollars.

Since Tasha made $80 in total, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:

"To calculate John's profit from renting out his car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month.
2. Calculate the total income from renting the car.
3. Subtract the car payment from the total income to find the profit.

Step 1: Total number of hours rented per month
John rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so:
10 times * 3 hours/time = 30 hours

Step 2: Total income from renting the car
John gets paid $25 an hour, so for 30 hours, he earns:
30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Step 3: Calculate the profit
John's car payment is $500, so his profit is:
$750 (income) - $500 (car payment) = $250

Therefore, John's profit from renting out his car is $250.

"Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since he is eating with his adult wife and their two children, and everyone eats one bowl at a meal, we need to calculate how many bowls of soup will be used for dinner and how many will be left for the children's lunch.

For dinner, there are:
- 2 adults (Calvin and his wife) who will each have 1 adult bowl.
- 2 children who will each have 1 child bowl.

Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total soup consumption for dinner is:
- 2 adults * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls
- 2 children * 1 child bowl = 2 child bowls

So, the total number of child bowls used for dinner is 4 (from the adults) + 2 (from the children) = 6 child bowls.

The pot originally holds 8 child bowls, so the number of child bowls left for lunch is:
8 child bowls - 6 child bowls used for dinner = 2 child bowls left.

Since there are 2 children, and 2 child bowls are left, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 1 time.

"Tim originally has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes, so the number of red shoe boxes used is:
1/3 * 9 = 3 red shoe boxes

The number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes

The total number of shoe boxes left is the sum of the blue and red shoe boxes left:
4 + 6 = 10 shoe boxes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.
2. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We can write this as an equation:

   D - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)

3. We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60, so D = 60. We can substitute this into the equation:

   60 - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)

4. Simplify the equation:

   52 = 2 * (A - 4)

5. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for A - 4:

   26 = A - 4

6. Add 4 to both sides to solve for A:

   26 + 4 = A
   30 = A

So Adam's current age is 30. The question asks how old Adam will be in 8 years, so we add 8 to Adam's current age:

   30 + 8 = 38

Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To find the total number of acres that Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms have together, we first need to calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be:

2 * 200 acres = 400 acres

Adding the additional 100 acres to this, we get:

400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres

Therefore, the two farms together have 700 acres.

"To find out how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many packages Colby completes per hour.
2. Calculate his hourly earnings.
3. Multiply his hourly earnings by the number of hours in a workday to find his total earnings.

Step 1: Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, which is:
50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Step 2: He gets paid $0.20 for every package, so his hourly earnings are:
40 packages/hour * $0.20/package = $8.00 per hour.

Step 3: To find his total earnings for an eight-hour workday, we multiply his hourly earnings by 8:
$8.00/hour * 8 hours = $64.00.

Therefore, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday.

"To solve this, we need to calculate the total time John spends on an extreme Sudoku puzzle and then determine how many bottles of water he drinks during that time.

A normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and an extreme Sudoku takes 4 times that long. So, the time for an extreme Sudoku is:

45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is every 30 minutes. To find out how many bottles he drinks in 180 minutes, we divide the total time by the interval at which he drinks:

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water during the time it takes him to complete an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( r \) as the number of red balloons,
- \( y \) as the number of yellow balloons.

According to the problem, Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We are also told that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna and that there were 20 red balloons.

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown can be represented by the equation:
\[ 2r + 3y = 58 \]

We know that \( r = 20 \), so we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Now, we solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide that amount by 2, since they had the same amount of allowance.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen (12) balloons at $0.5 for 2 balloons is \(12 / 2 * 0.5 = 6 * 0.5 = $3\).
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each is \(2 * 7 = $14\).

The total amount spent is \(11 + 3 + 14 = $28\).

Since this amount is the combined allowance of Julia and Nadine, we divide it by 2 to find out how much each one received:
\(28 / 2 = $14\).

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:
300 lollipops * $0.8/lollypop = $240

Then, we calculate the total cost of purchasing the lollipops:
300 lollipops * $0.5/lollypop = $150

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
$240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea by subtracting the number of cinnamon tea cups from the total number of cups.
2. Divide the result by 3 to find out how many cups of chamomile and mint tea are in each row.
3. Since the number of chamomile and mint tea cups is equal in each row, divide the number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row by 2 to find the number of mint tea cups in each row.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total cups of chamomile and mint tea: 27 (total cups) - 15 (cinnamon tea cups) = 12 cups
2. Cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row: 12 (chamomile and mint tea cups) / 3 (rows) = 4 cups
3. Cups of mint tea in each row: 4 (chamomile and mint tea cups in each row) / 2 = 2 cups

So, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make one trip (down, pick berries, and back up), in 8 hours, he can make:

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

To collect 24 berries in 2 trips, he must pick up:

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip to meet his goal is 12.

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his total expenses for the month and subtract that from the $150 he was given.

First, let's calculate the cost of the movies he has already seen:
- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays at $10 each: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days at $7 each: 8 * $7 = $56

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorn and candy he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy at $2 each: 4 * $2 = $8

Now, let's add up all his expenses so far:
- Movies: $50 + $56 = $106
- Snacks: $16 + $8 = $24
- Total expenses: $106 + $24 = $130

Colby has $150 to spend, so let's see how much he has left:
- Remaining money: $150 - $130 = $20

On the last day of the month, which is a Friday, he wants to see a movie, get a popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for this will be:
- Movie ticket: $10
- Popcorn: $8
- Candy: $2
- Total for the night: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

Since the cost for the night is exactly $20, which is the amount he has left, he can see 1 more movie.

"To find the total number of calories in the mini pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one, so it has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.
- Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls are 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.

Next, we calculate the calories for the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one, so it has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.
- Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories for the mini blueberry muffins are 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we add the calories from both types of pastries to get the total:
- Total calories = calories from mini cinnamon rolls + calories from mini blueberry muffins
- Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is again 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:

39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday) + 78 (Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 300 Junebugs.

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance.

The formula to calculate distance is:
Distance = Speed × Time

For the bus:
Distance_bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
Distance_car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance to find out how much farther the bus went:
Distance_bus - Distance_car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

Let's add these numbers together:

31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before the bouncy balls from the new total:

62 (total toys after buying bouncy balls) - 48 (total toys before buying bouncy balls) = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as P, Pa, and J, respectively.

According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   P + Pa + J = 100

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   Pa = J + 10

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   P = Pa + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third to express Peter's age in terms of Jean's age:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now we can substitute the expressions for P and Pa from the second and third equations into the first equation:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
4J + 20 = 100
4J = 80
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:

Pa = J + 10
Pa = 20 + 10
Pa = 30

And finally, we can find Peter's age:

P = Pa + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

So, Peter is 50 years old.

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes

Now, let's add the 10 boxes they already have:
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Next, we need to find out how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, with each table holding 2 boxes:
60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by each machine over the course of a month and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

- The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour.
- The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour.

Both machines run 24 hours a day for 30 days, so the total number of hours each machine runs in a month is:

24 hours/day * 30 days = 720 hours

Now, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine:

- Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 720 hours = 43,200 widgets
- WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 720 hours = 32,400 widgets

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the widgets:

- Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
- WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Finally, we find the difference in revenue:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the amount of hay needed for the goats.
2. Calculate the amount of hay needed for the sheep.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total.

Step 1: Hay for the goats
Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is:
15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds

Step 2: Hay for the sheep
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, each sheep needs:
(2 * 5 pounds) - 3 pounds = 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds

With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is:
12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

Step 3: Total hay needed
The total amount of hay Nate needs is the sum of the hay for the goats and the hay for the sheep:
75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

1. Calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:
   10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

2. Calculate the discount amount:
   40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

3. Calculate the total cost of the CDs after the discount:
   $150 - $60 = $90

4. Calculate the amount James received from selling 5 CDs:
   5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

5. Since the amount he received from selling the CDs is more than the total cost after the discount, he actually made a profit. However, the question asks how much money he was out, which in this case is negative (he gained money).

   $90 (total cost) - $200 (amount received from selling) = -$110

Since the question asks for the amount of money he was out, and he actually gained money, the answer is that he was not out any money, but rather gained $110. However, if we strictly follow the question and provide a positive value for the amount he was out, we would say he was out $0.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings from selling her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.0

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.0

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.0

Now, we add up the earnings from each type of crop to get the total earnings:
$9.0 + $20.0 + $5.0 = $34.0

Jen will earn $34.0 if she sells everything.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several parts:

1. Calculate the distance James swims before resting.
2. Calculate the time it takes for him to swim that distance.
3. Calculate the time he spends resting.
4. Calculate the remaining distance he has to swim.
5. Calculate the time it takes for him to swim the remaining distance at half speed.
6. Add up all the times to get the total time.

Let's start with the first part:

1. James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake:
   \( 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \)

2. The time it takes for him to swim 12 miles at 2 miles per hour:
   \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \)

3. The time he spends resting is half the swimming time:
   \( 6 \text{ hours} \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ hours} \)

4. The remaining distance to swim is:
   \( 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \)

5. The time it takes for him to swim the remaining 8 miles at half his original speed (1 mile per hour):
   \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \)

6. The total time is the sum of the time spent swimming the first part, resting, and swimming the second part:
   \( 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \)

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours.

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can set up the equation based on the information given:

Let \( S \) represent the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. According to the problem, \( S = 70 \).

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had. So, the number of loaves the bakery has can be represented as:

\( 7 \times S - 40 \)

Substituting \( S \) with 70, we get:

\( 7 \times 70 - 40 \)

Now, we calculate the result:

\( 490 - 40 = 450 \)

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission per copy = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50
- Total commission from 6 copies = 6 * $0.50 = $3.00

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission per copy = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20
- Total commission from 10 copies = 10 * $1.20 = $12.00

Total commission from both newspapers:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00

The final numerical answer is:

"To find Leo's age, we first need to determine Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, who is 26 years old.

So, Marcus's age is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo’s age. Therefore, to find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus's age by 2:

21 * 2 = 42 years old

Leo is 42 years old.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati as B, by Azibo as A, and by Dinar as D. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. B + A + D = 45 (the total points scored by the team)
2. B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

From the second equation, we can express A in terms of B: A = B - 20.
From the third equation, we can express D in terms of B: D = B - 10.

Now we can substitute A and D in the first equation with their expressions in terms of B:

B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45
3B - 30 = 45
3B = 75
B = 25

Now that we know B, we can find A:

A = B - 20
A = 25 - 20
A = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine how many reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling and then use his stapling rate to find the total number of reports.

First, let's calculate the total time in minutes:

- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
- 15 hours is equal to 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Next, we need to determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:

- 900 minutes / 15 minutes per interval = 60 intervals.

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can now calculate the total number of reports:

- 60 intervals * 30 reports per interval = 1800 reports.

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports.

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was in bed and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier than usual.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours of sleep. In minutes, that is:

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

On the day in question, she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is:

2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes

She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than her usual wake-up time of 6 a.m., so she woke up at:

6:00 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

The time from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is:

7 hours and 55 minutes = 7 * 60 minutes + 55 minutes = 420 + 55 = 475 minutes

Now, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total time she was in bed:

475 minutes - 23 minutes = 452 minutes

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.

"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. If he has two dozen cups, that means he has 24 measuring cups (since 1 dozen equals 12).

To find out how many measuring spoons he has, we calculate 2/3 of 24:

\[ \text{Measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

If he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ \text{Measuring spoons remaining} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of measuring cups to the number of measuring spoons remaining:

\[ \text{Total utensils remaining} = \text{Measuring cups} + \text{Measuring spoons remaining} \]
\[ \text{Total utensils remaining} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital.
2. Then, we will calculate the number of patients admitted over the course of 2 weeks.
3. Finally, we will find the total number of unoccupied beds after these admissions.

Step 1: Initial number of occupied beds
The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these are occupied.
Initial occupied beds = 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds

Step 2: Number of patients admitted over 2 weeks
There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days.
Patients admitted each day = 50
Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Step 3: Total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks
Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = Initial occupied beds + Total patients admitted
Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Total unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks
Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100.

1. Calculate the number of non-work emails: Since Robyn sends 16 emails a day and 7 are work emails, the remainder is 16 - 7 = 9 emails.
2. Calculate the number of emails to family: Two-thirds of the 9 non-work emails are to family, so 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails.
3. Calculate the number of emails to her boyfriend: One-third of the remaining emails (which are not work or family) are to her boyfriend. Since 9 - 6 = 3 emails are left, 1/3 * 3 = 1 email.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find out how old Shawna's father is, we need to first determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age.

Given that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find out how old Shawna's father is. Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number but overstated this by 20%, we can find the actual number of people who attended the concert by calculating what 100% (the actual number) would be.

Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \). Courtney's report of 48 people is 120% of the actual number, because she overstated by 20%.

So we have the equation:

\[ 120\% \times x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we can convert 120% to a decimal and solve for \( x \):

\[ 1.20 \times x = 48 \]

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day, and then use the information that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.

Let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:

- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes

Total holes by the end of the third day: 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes

Now, we know that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes, so four times that is:

4 * 10 = 40 holes

This means that by the end of the fourth day, there were 40 holes in total. Since there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

40 (total holes by the end of the fourth day) - 29 (holes by the end of the third day) = 11 holes

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"To find out how much the travel costs, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of the supplies. If the supplies cost $400, then 50% of $400 is $200. Therefore, the travel cost is the cost of the supplies plus 50% of the cost of the supplies.

Travel cost = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Travel cost = $400 + $200
Travel cost = $600

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

Let A represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught,
Let S represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught,
Let W represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. A + S + W = 339 (Together they have caught 339 Pokemon)
2. A = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
3. S = 4W - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to eliminate A:

(S + 5) + S + W = 339
2S + W + 5 = 339
2S + W = 334 (Equation 4)

Now we can substitute the third equation into Equation 4 to eliminate S:

2(4W - 13) + W = 334
8W - 26 + W = 334
9W - 26 = 334
9W = 360
W = 40 (Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon)

Now that we know W, we can find S using the third equation:

S = 4W - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147 (Stan has caught 147 Pokemon)

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then multiply that by the length of each episode.

We know that each episode is 20 minutes long and that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. This means that the number of episodes is 20 / 2, which is 10 episodes.

Now, to find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance the bird traveled in each direction and then sum the distances traveled to the south, subtracting the distance traveled to the north.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 10 hours = 300 miles

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 18 mph * 2 hours = 36 miles

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 22 mph * 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we add the distances traveled to the south and subtract the distance traveled to the north to find the total distance between the two homes:

Total distance = (Distance south 1 + Distance south 2) - Distance north
Total distance = (300 miles + 110 miles) - 36 miles
Total distance = 410 miles - 36 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

1. Greta made a batch of one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself.
2. She was sent home with 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office party.
3. Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies for her surprise party.
4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.

Let's convert dozens to individual brownies (1 dozen = 12 brownies):

- Greta's batch: 1 dozen = 12 brownies
- From the office: 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies
- From the surprise party: 4 dozen = 48 brownies
- Eaten during the party: 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies Greta had:

12 (her batch) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from the party) = 66 brownies

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten:

66 (total brownies) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Determine the number of boxes sold on each day:
   - On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
   - On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
   - On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, and on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. So on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

2. Calculate the total number of boxes sold for each item over the two days:
   - Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
   - Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

3. Calculate the earnings from each item:
   - Gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6/box = $150
   - Apple pie: 26 boxes * $15/box = $390

4. Calculate the total earnings:
   - Total earnings = Earnings from gingerbread + Earnings from apple pie

4. Since Emil will be 24 and that is twice the age of his brother, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old when Emil is 24.
5. Since Emil's brother will be 12 when Emil is 24, and Emil is currently 19, his brother is 12 - 5 = 7 years old now.
6. Emil's dad will be 48 when Emil is 24, so he is 48 - 5 = 43 years old now.

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now:

43 (dad's age now) + 7 (brother's age now) = 50

"To find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we need to add up the beads she received from her mother, her sister, and her friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, which is 20 * 2 = 40 beads.

Now, we add all the beads together:

20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads.

"To find out how many servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days and then divide that by the amount that constitutes one serving.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

The total amount of crawfish Joe caught is:
3 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) + 6 (Saturday) = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings Joe has is:
21 pounds / 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings.

"To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members, and then add these numbers together.

First, we calculate the number of football players:
20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we find out how many students are left after the football players leave:
30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Then, we calculate the number of cheerleaders or band members from the remaining students:
25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:
6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is:

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

Charlie's boot size = 5 * Sophie's boot size
Charlie's boot size = 5 * 5
Charlie's boot size = 25

Now that we know the size of both Charlie's and Sophie's boots, we can calculate the average size:

Average size = (Sophie's boot size + Charlie's boot size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the width of the flowers from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy.
3. Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed.
4. Subtract the number of plants Pat already owns from the total number of plants needed.
5. Calculate the cost of the additional plants needed.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Each flower grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot (since 12 inches = 1 foot).

2. Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between them, so the total space each plant will occupy is:
   1 foot (width of the plant) + 1.5 feet (space between plants) = 2.5 feet per plant.

3. To find out how many plants can fit in the 111-foot-long flower bed, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant occupies:
   111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4 plants.
   Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional plants needed is:
   44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants.

5. Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:
   27 plants * $6 per plant = $162.

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"To find out how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply that by the number of baskets.

For one basket, the cost of the petunias is:
3 petunias * $3.00 per petunia = $9.00

The cost of the sweet potato vines for one basket is:
2 sweet potato vines * $2.50 per vine = $5.00

The total cost for one basket is:
$9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00

Now, to find the total cost for all 5 baskets, we multiply the cost of one basket by the number of baskets:
$14.00 per basket * 5 baskets = $70.00

So, the total amount Katherine will spend is:
$70.00

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then see how much soil is left for the roses.

First, let's calculate the soil used for the sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Next, the soil used for the carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds

The total amount of soil they started with is 30 pounds, so the remaining soil for the roses is:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"Jessica sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck, which is:

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

She saves this amount each month, so in a year (12 months), she will have saved:

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of pairs she can buy with her yearly savings is:

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes for each task and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she can peel them:

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes to saute 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can find out how many minutes it takes to saute 90 shrimp by dividing the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can saute in one batch and then multiplying by the time it takes to saute one batch:

90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per batch = 3 batches
3 batches * 10 minutes per batch = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp to the time it takes to saute them:

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sauteing) = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature change for each period the air conditioner was running and when it was off.

1. On low for 3 hours: The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   Temperature change = 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees cooler.

2. On high for 4 hours: The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   Temperature change = 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees cooler.

3. Off for 2 hours: The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   Temperature change = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees warmer.

Now, we combine these changes to find the total temperature change from the starting point.

Total temperature change = (6 degrees cooler) + (12 degrees cooler) - (4 degrees warmer)
Total temperature change = 18 degrees cooler - 4 degrees warmer
Total temperature change = 14 degrees cooler

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, which means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.

Since the comet appears every 75 years, the first time Bill saw the comet must have been 75 years before he saw it the second time.

So, if Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time, he must have been 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to add up the checks he writes for each of his expenses:

- Electric bill: 1 check per month × 12 months = 12 checks per year
- Gas bill: 1 check per month × 12 months = 12 checks per year
- Church: 2 checks per month × 12 months = 24 checks per year
- Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter × 4 quarters = 4 checks per year

Now, we add them all up:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks per year

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day be \( F \).
2. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).
3. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France and the number of flights to Germany are each \( \frac{1}{8}F \) (since \( 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} \) is split equally between two destinations, so \( \frac{1}{4} \div 2 = \frac{1}{8} \)).

4. The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes is twice the number of flights the second plane makes:
   \[ F = 2 \times 44 \]
   \[ F = 88 \]

5. Now we can calculate the number of flights to France:
   \[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F \]
   \[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 \]
   \[ \text{Flights to France} = 11 \]

So, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add up the duration of all three wolves' howls:
20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) + 60 (Igneous) = 120 seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the total seconds to minutes:
120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"To find Wilfred's age, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar's age = A = 3 years
- Alessandro's age = L = 4 years
- Helene's age = H
- Wilfred's age = W

The total age of the children is 20 years, so we can write:
A + L + H + W = 20

Substituting the known ages of Akbar and Alessandro, we get:
3 + 4 + H + W = 20
7 + H + W = 20
H + W = 13  (Equation 1)

We are also told that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So the average age is 20 / 4 = 5 years. Therefore, Helene's age is twice this average:
H = 2 * 5
H = 10  (Equation 2)

Now we can substitute Helene's age into Equation 1 to find Wilfred's age:
10 + W = 13
W = 13 - 10
W = 3

So, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"To find out how many people were in the church next door, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests.
2. Determine how many cookies were given to the church.
3. Calculate how many people in the church received 15 cookies each.

Step 1: Total number of cookies brought by the guests
There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.
Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Step 2: Number of cookies given to the church
The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church.
Cookies given to the church = 1/2 * 1500 cookies = 750 cookies

Step 3: Number of people in the church who received 15 cookies each
Each person in the church received 15 cookies.
Number of people = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

So, 50 people were in the church next door.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a ratio to represent the distribution of the watermelon slices. Let's say each kid's slice is of size \( x \). Then, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

There are 4 kids and 2 adults, so the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the whole watermelon is divided into 8 parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets \( 2x \), which is \( 2 \) parts out of the \( 8 \) total parts. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he will spend on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from his total available time at the clinic.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds:
- He has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient.
- 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments:
- He has 10 appointments and each takes 30 minutes.
- 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

Now, let's convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments into hours:
- 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.
- 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

Finally, let's subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total available time:
- He has 9 hours available and he will spend 8 hours on rounds and appointments.
- 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time required for each step and then subtract that total from the time she wants to serve the cake.

The total time required is:
- 20 minutes to make the cake batter
- 30 minutes to bake the cake
- 2 hours to cool the cake
- 10 minutes to frost the cake

Let's convert all the times to minutes for easier calculation:
- 20 minutes (batter)
- 30 minutes (baking)
- 2 hours = 120 minutes (cooling)
- 10 minutes (frosting)

Now, let's add up the total time in minutes:
20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find the latest time she can start, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold \( 64 \) chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 8 \):

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the following:

1. The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. The cost per student per session is $1.50.
3. There are 10 students.
4. The studio is rented 3 days a week.

First, we calculate the total cost per session:
- Studio rental cost per session: $25
- Cost per student per session: $1.50 * 10 students = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we calculate the total cost per week:
- Total cost per session * 3 sessions per week = $40 * 3 = $120

Now, we need to determine the number of weeks in a month. For simplicity, we'll assume an average month has about 4 weeks.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month:
- Total cost per week * 4 weeks = $120 * 4 = $480

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month would be the total cost, which is the amount the studio would need to cover. However, if you are asking for the revenue (which is the income before expenses), we need to calculate the income from the students.

Revenue per session from students:
- $1.50 * 10 students = $15

Total revenue per week:
- $15 * 3 sessions = $45

Total revenue per month:
- $45 * 4 weeks = $180

So, the expected earnings (revenue) of the dance studio in a month from the students would be $180.

However, if you are asking for the net earnings (revenue minus expenses), we would subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Net earnings per month:
- Total revenue per month - Total cost per month = $180 - $480 = -$300

The studio would actually be losing $300 per month based on the given information.

"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to first determine how many chocolate bars are in each of their boxes.

Let's start with Peter. If Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars, we can find the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = Total chocolate bars / Number of boxes
Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = 64 / 4
Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = 16

Now, let's do the same for Martha. If Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars, we can find the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes by dividing her total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = Total chocolate bars / Number of boxes
Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = 56 / 7
Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = 8

Now we can find the difference in the number of chocolate bars between each of Peter's boxes and each of Martha's boxes:

Difference = Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes - Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes
Difference = 16 - 8
Difference = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find out how many porcupines will be in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of babies born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
4. Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population to get the final population.

Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.
The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population of 50.
Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Step 2: Determine the number of babies born each month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
Babies born each month = Number of female porcupines * 4
Babies born each month = 30 * 4 = 120

Step 3: Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.
Total babies born in a year = Babies born each month * 12
Total babies born in a year = 120 * 12 = 1440

Step 4: Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population.
Final population = Initial population + Total babies born in a year
Final population = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons using the given conversion factor.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons and the cost per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume (V) can be calculated using the formula:
V = length × width × depth

V = 25 feet × 14 feet × 4 feet
V = 1400 cubic feet

Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.
The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.

Gallons = Volume × 5.9
Gallons = 1400 cubic feet × 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the cost.
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Gallons × Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 gallons × $0.10/gallon
Cost = $826

The cost to fill the pool is $826.

"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled and then subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance.

The formula to calculate distance is:
Distance = Speed × Time

For Matteo:
Distance_Matteo = Speed_Matteo × Time_Matteo
Distance_Matteo = 55 mph × 4 hours
Distance_Matteo = 220 miles

For Shandy:
Distance_Shandy = Speed_Shandy × Time_Shandy
Distance_Shandy = 45 mph × 10 hours
Distance_Shandy = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove:
Distance_Shandy - Distance_Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles
Distance_Shandy - Distance_Matteo = 230 miles

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we need to break down the student population by age and gender.

First, we'll determine the number of students over 16 years old and the number of students under 16 years old:
- Students over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500
- Students under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500

Next, we'll find out how many of the students over 16 years old are male and how many are female:
- Male students over 16 years old: 1500 / 4 = 375
- Female students over 16 years old: 1500 - 375 = 1125

Then, we'll determine the number of male and female students under 16 years old:
- Male students under 16 years old: 1500 / 2 = 750
- Female students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750

Finally, we'll add the number of female students over 16 years old to the number of female students under 16 years old to get the total number of female students:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps in one hour.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps in one hour.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps in one hour.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps:

10 (Bethany's laps) - 5 (Quinn's laps) = 5

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.

- Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day:
  \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons

- Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day:
  \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons

Now, let's add up all the water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda:
  \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons

- Total water pumped by Ms. B:
  \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons

- Total water pumped into the tank:
  \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining:

- Water remaining to fill the tank:
  \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons

"To find out the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

First, we need to account for the last 3 hours when the power bank was losing 7% of its total capacity each hour. If the power bank lost 7% each hour, then at the end of each hour, it retained 93% (100% - 7%) of its charge from the previous hour. We can reverse this process to find the charge before these 3 hours.

Let's denote the charge before the last 3 hours as \( C_1 \). After 3 hours, the charge is 28%, so we have:
\[ C_1 \times 0.93^3 = 28\% \]

Now, we need to solve for \( C_1 \):
\[ C_1 = \frac{28\%}{0.93^3} \]

Next, we need to account for the first 5 hours when the power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour. Similarly, if the power bank lost 9% each hour, it retained 91% (100% - 9%) of its charge from the previous hour. We can reverse this process to find the charge before these 5 hours.

Let's denote the initial charge when Maria went to the park as \( C_0 \). After 5 hours, the charge is \( C_1 \), so we have:
\[ C_0 \times 0.91^5 = C_1 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( C_0 \):
\[ C_0 = \frac{C_1}{0.91^5} \]

Let's calculate \( C_1 \) first:
\[ C_1 = \frac{28\%}{0.93^3} \approx \frac{28\%}{0.804357} \approx 34.80\% \]

Now, we can calculate \( C_0 \):
\[ C_0 = \frac{34.80\%}{0.91^5} \approx \frac{34.80\%}{0.624032} \approx 55.77\% \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 56%.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10,000.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Next, we need to determine how much Janet earns in a week. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, which totals to $25 an hour.

$10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

$25 per hour * 40 hours = $1,000 per week

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2,000, which is the amount needed for the down payment.

$2,000 (total needed) / $1,000 (weekly earnings) = 2 weeks

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment for the car.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased and then see how much money he has left to spend on plums.

The cost of the fruits Jamaar has already bought is as follows:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:

Total cost = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the amount of money he has left after these purchases is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can calculate how many plums he can buy with the remaining money:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Jamaar can buy 3 plums with the remaining money.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

Final Price = Initial Price * (1 + Rate of Increase) ^ Number of Years

Where:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate of Increase = 5% or 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Let's calculate the final price:

Final Price = $120 * (1 + 0.05) ^ 3
Final Price = $120 * (1.05) ^ 3
Final Price = $120 * 1.157625
Final Price = $138.915

"To find out how many portraits and selfies Olivia had, we need to determine how many pictures were in each album and then multiply that number by the number of albums for selfies and portraits.

First, we find out how many pictures are in each album:
72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Next, we calculate the number of selfies:
3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies

Then, we calculate the number of portraits:
2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits

Finally, we add the number of selfies and portraits together to get the total:
27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45 pictures

"To find out how long James spends reading, we can set up a proportion based on the information given. If James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages.

The proportion is as follows:

3 pages / 10 minutes = 18 pages / x minutes

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and divide:

x = (18 pages * 10 minutes) / 3 pages

"To find out how many guests the hotel now has, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations.

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so we subtract 24 from 100:
   100 - 24 = 76 guests remaining.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so we subtract 15 from the remaining 76:
   76 - 15 = 61 guests remaining.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number checked in:
   2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.
5. We add the 30 guests who checked in to the 61 guests remaining:
   61 + 30 = 91 guests.
6. After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so we add 7 to the 91 guests:
   91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The hotel now has 98 guests.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( L = 3S \) and \( S = 4 \) dollars.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( x \) and the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( y \). The problem states that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \( x = 2y \).

The total earnings from the sales are given as $120, which can be represented by the equation:
\[ xS + yL = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 4 \) and \( L = 3S = 12 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4x + 12y = 120 \]

Since \( x = 2y \), we can substitute \( 2y \) for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 4(2y) + 12y = 120 \]
\[ 8y + 12y = 120 \]
\[ 20y = 120 \]
\[ y = 6 \]

Now, we can find \( x \) by substituting \( y \) back into \( x = 2y \):
\[ x = 2(6) \]
\[ x = 12 \]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day, and then multiply that by the number of dwarves and the number of days in the month.

1. First, we find out how much ore a dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe:
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so:
     12 pounds * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

2. Next, we calculate how much ore a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe:
   - A steel pickaxe allows a dwarf to mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so:
     24 pounds * 1.5 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

3. Now, we calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day with steel pickaxes:
   - 40 dwarves * 36 pounds = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

4. Finally, we calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in 30 days:
   - 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = 43200 pounds of ore.

"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the information that the prices are proportional. This means that the cost per sandwich is the same for all package sizes.

Let's calculate the cost per sandwich for the first two packages:

- For the first package, the cost per sandwich is $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.
- For the second package, the cost per sandwich is $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package should also be $1.50. Therefore, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is:

- 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12.

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sally starts with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.
2. 40% of the red balloons burst, so she loses 40% of 25, which is 10 red balloons. She now has 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.
3. She accidentally releases half of the yellow balloons, so she loses 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. She now has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.
4. She finds 8 blue balloons and adds 75% of them to her clutch. 75% of 8 is 6 blue balloons. She adds these to her remaining balloons.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he would not have to turn it in and then subtract that from 100%.

1. There's a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
2. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. This means there's a 50% * 40% = 20% chance that the normal teacher will give an extension.
3. If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension (50% * 60% = 30% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. This means there's a 30% * 20% = 6% chance that Marcus will get a personal extension.

Now, we add up the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (class extension) + 6% (personal extension) = 76%

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the complement of the probability that he won't have to turn it in:

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family by subtracting the seats for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.
2. Divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the math:

Total seats available for friends and family = Total capacity - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
Total seats available for friends and family = 6000 - 950 - 300
Total seats available for friends and family = 4750

Now, we divide the total seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates:

Tickets per graduate = Total seats available for friends and family / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place and the time it will take to move between them.

First, we calculate the number of soda bottles:

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between bottles is 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 intervals.

However, the number of bottles is one more than the number of intervals because the first bottle is placed at the start of the driveway. So, the total number of bottles is 8 intervals + 1 = 9 bottles.

Next, we calculate the time it will take to move between the bottles:

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, and he has to move between 8 intervals (not 9, because he starts at the first bottle and doesn't need to move to start), the total time spent moving is 8 intervals * 5 seconds per interval = 40 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 40 seconds.

"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will be using. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, and Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of the fabric piece will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of the fabric piece will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide that by the number of painters.

First, we need to determine the total number of days the painters worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is:

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Next, we calculate the fraction of a day they worked each day, which is 3/8 of a day. To find out how many hours that is, we multiply 3/8 by the number of hours in a day (24 hours):

3/8 * 24 hours/day = 9 hours/day

Now, we can find out the total number of hours worked by the team over the 21 days:

9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find out how many hours each painter worked:

189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours

Each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \). According to the problem:

- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the second set, Rory retrieved \( x \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19, so we can write the equation:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:

\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we have \( x \), the number of balls retrieved in the second set, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we can use the formula for exponential decay, which is:

Final Value = Initial Value * (1 - rate of depreciation) ^ number of years

In this case, the initial value is $20,000, the rate of depreciation is 21% or 0.21, and the number of years from 2007 to 2010 is 3.

Final Value = $20,000 * (1 - 0.21) ^ 3
Final Value = $20,000 * (0.79) ^ 3
Final Value = $20,000 * 0.493039
Final Value = $9,860.78

Rounded to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is $9,860.78.

"To find out how many Spanish books there are, we can start by calculating the number of books in English and German, and then subtracting those from the total number of books.

Half of the books are in English, so:
50 books * 1/2 = 25 books in English

10% of the books are in German, so:
50 books * 10/100 = 5 books in German

Now, we can find the number of Spanish books by subtracting the number of English and German books from the total:
50 books - 25 books (English) - 5 books (German) = 20 books in Spanish

The number of Spanish books is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Becky ate 10 slices.
2. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.
3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Now, we can add up the slices that each person ate to find the total number of slices they ate together.

Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices = Total slices eaten
10 + 7 + 14 = 31

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is 31.

"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's time as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each took, which is 98 minutes. So we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Solving for \( D \):

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]
\[ 2D = 98 - 18 \]
\[ 2D = 80 \]
\[ D = 40 \]

Now that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find out how long Betsy's part took:

\[ Betsy's\ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

So, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up the cost of the cast, the cost of the visit, the cost of the painkillers, and the cost of the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit, which is half an hour, so the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4 per pill for 30 pills, so the cost is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of the parking is $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these costs together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas they ordered.

First, let's calculate the number of pizzas the glee club ate:
- The glee club ordered 20 pizzas.
- They ate 70% of them, which is 0.70 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

Now, let's calculate the number of pizzas the football team ate:
- The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
- They ate 80% of them, which is 0.80 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Next, we'll find out how many pizzas are left from each group:
- The glee club has 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.
- The football team has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

Finally, we add the remaining pizzas from both groups to get the total number of pizzas left:

"To find out how much Anthony spends on postage, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of big coupons:
- Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he will send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

Next, we calculate the cost for the small coupons:
- Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

Then, we calculate the cost for the big coupons:
- Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Finally, we add the costs together to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of small coupons + cost of big coupons = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
- Total cost in dollars = 24500 cents / 100 = $245.

"To determine the cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we need to calculate the cost based on the promotion at the grocery store.

First, let's find out how many pounds of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the promotion:
- The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off.""
- For every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis pays full price for 1 pound and half price for the second pound.
- The cost of 1 pound of butter is $4.00.
- The cost of 2 pounds of butter with the promotion is $4.00 + $2.00 (half off) = $6.00.

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
- 6 pounds of butter can be divided into 3 sets of 2 pounds.
- The cost for each set of 2 pounds is $6.00.
- Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is 3 sets * $6.00 = $18.00.

The base fee covers 20 people, so we need to find out how many additional guests there are:
Additional guests = Total attending - 20 = 41 - 20 = 21 people

The cost for each additional guest is $6, so the additional cost is:
Additional cost = 21 * $6 = $126

First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen (12) roses cost $15, we can find the cost of 15 roses by calculating the cost of 12 roses and the cost of the additional 3 roses.

Cost of 12 roses: $15
Cost of 3 roses: 3 * $2 = $6

Total cost of 15 roses: $15 + $6 = $21

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which means she had a total of:

"To find out how much Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Each banana costs $0.80.
- Jenny bought 10 bunches, with each bunch averaging 4 bananas.
- So, the total number of bananas is 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.
- The cost of 40 bananas at $0.80 each is 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Jenny bought 10 bunches, so the total cost is 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):

\( S + (S + 60) = 100 \)

Combine like terms:

\( 2S + 60 = 100 \)

Subtract 60 from both sides:

x = (8 inches * 13 years) / 4 years

Now we calculate the value of x:

x = (104 inches*years) / 4 years
x = 26 inches

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes sold: 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150 bikes
- BMX bikes sold: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45 bikes
- MTB bikes sold: The rest of the bikes, so 300 - (150 + 45) = 300 - 195 = 105 bikes

Now, let's calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 bikes * ($500 / 2) = 45 bikes * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500

Finally, we add up the earnings from all types of bikes to get the total earnings:

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500
Total earnings = $131,250

"The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. Over a 6-hour day, the farmer will have made:

5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. Over a 6-hour day, the truck will have picked up:

3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

To find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:

30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

"To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class during the week and then add the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the total minutes John spends in class during a normal school day:
- A normal student has 6 periods, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods a day.
- Each class is 40 minutes long, so in one day he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes in class.

Next, let's calculate the total minutes he spends in class during the week:
- He goes to class for 5 days a week, so he spends 5 * 320 = 1600 minutes in class during the week.

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday:
- He spends 1/16 of his weekly class minutes each on Saturday and Sunday, so for each day, he spends 1600 / 16 = 100 minutes.
- For both days, he spends 2 * 100 = 200 minutes.

Finally, let's calculate the total minutes he spends learning during the week:
- The total minutes spent learning is the sum of the minutes spent in class and the extra learning time, which is 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- 1800 minutes / 60 = 30 hours.

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then apply the 2/3rds ratio again for the second bounce.

First, we determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since each story is 24 feet high and Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, the initial height is:

24 feet/story * 3 stories = 72 feet

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3rds of the initial height:

72 feet * 2/3 = 48 feet

After the second bounce, the ball again reaches 2/3rds of the height it reached after the first bounce:

48 feet * 2/3 = 32 feet

So, on its second bounce, the ball goes up to 32 feet.

"To find the height of the fourth child in inches, we need to follow the information given step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.
2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.
3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.
4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The height of the fourth child is 72 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left, because the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex.

2. The 540 kilograms is what was left after the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, before the T-Rex ate, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops.

Therefore, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To calculate the cost to paint the room, we need to determine the total area of the walls and then figure out how many gallons of paint are required.

First, let's calculate the area of the north and south walls:
- Each wall is 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of one wall is 10 * 8 = 80 square feet.
- Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

Next, let's calculate the area of the east and west walls:
- Each wall is 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of one wall is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet.
- Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
- Total area = 160 (north and south) + 80 (east and west) = 240 square feet.

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so we need to determine how many gallons are required:
- Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Finally, we calculate the cost of the paint:
- Cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon = 12 * $12 = $144.

The cost to paint the room is $144.

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of picking a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there are 12 sodas in total, with 3 of them being shaken. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas (3 shaken and 8 unshaken). Ellen's brother then takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 10 sodas in total (2 shaken and 8 unshaken - 2 = 6 unshaken).

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left, making a total of 8 sodas. The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of sodas
Probability = 2 / 8
Probability = 1 / 4

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Percentage = (1 / 4) * 100
Percentage = 25%

"The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second train is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour. Since they are traveling in opposite directions, their speeds add up when calculating the distance between them.

The distance the first train travels in 3 hours is:
60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

The distance the second train travels in 3 hours is:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

The total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is the sum of the distances they have each traveled:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of days Billy volunteers, the number of days he takes off, and then the total number of people he helps.

First, let's find out the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th, inclusive.

March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So the total number of days is:
31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

Billy takes 20% of these days off, so the number of days he takes off is:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

Therefore, the number of days he volunteers is:
50 days - 10 days = 40 days

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he helps each day is:
2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Now, we can calculate the total number of people he helps over the 40 days he volunteers:
6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the cars and buses could carry.

First, we calculate the number of people the buses could carry:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, we calculate the number of people the cars could carry:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the two numbers together to get the total number of people:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Therefore, the total number of people who could have been inside the church is 480.

"To find Jeff's age, we can start by determining Martha's age. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4 years
Martha's age = 24 years - 4 years
Martha's age = 20 years

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10 years
Jeff's age = 20 years + 10 years
Jeff's age = 30 years

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Length = 240 feet
Speed = 80 feet/minute
Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

The difference in time:
Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

"To calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days, we need to add up the time he spends on each activity per day and then multiply by the number of days.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. So, the total time spent on breaks and lunch per day is:

30 minutes (lunch) + 15 minutes (first break) + 15 minutes (second break) = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this means Bobby spends 1 hour on his lunch and breaks each day.

Over 5 days, the total time spent is:

1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

So, the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours.

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for a 20-year retirement, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount based on her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   40% of her current annual salary is $100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000 per year.

2. Calculate the total amount needed for 20 years of retirement:
   $40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000.

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves from each paycheck:
   She saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 per year.

4. Determine how many years it will take to save the total amount needed:
   Total amount needed / Amount saved per year = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for a 20-year retirement at 40% of her current annual salary.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. We can set up the equation:

40% * Total Students = 240 boys

To find the total number of students, we divide the number of boys by 40% (or 0.40):

Total Students = 240 boys / 0.40

Now we can calculate the total number of students:

Total Students = 240 / 0.40
Total Students = 600

Since 40% of the school population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can now calculate the number of girls:

"To find out how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we can set up a proportion based on the rate of blinking. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We want to find out how many minutes (let's call this x) it will take for the light to blink 459 times.

The proportion is as follows:

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 459 blinks / x minutes

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and divide:

x = (459 blinks * 5 minutes) / 255 blinks

Now we can calculate the value of x:

"To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to calculate the distance for one round trip and then multiply it by the number of visits he makes in a month.

First, we calculate the distance for one way:
- Speed = 70 mph
- Time = 2 hours

Distance (one way) = Speed * Time
Distance (one way) = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance (one way) = 140 miles

Since this is a round trip, we need to double the distance for one way to get the total distance for a round trip:
Distance (round trip) = Distance (one way) * 2
Distance (round trip) = 140 miles * 2
Distance (round trip) = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits:
Distance (monthly) = Distance (round trip) * Number of visits
Distance (monthly) = 280 miles * 2
Distance (monthly) = 560 miles

So, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents.

"To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can start by calculating the total number of toys produced by the other four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The two workers who produce 6 toys an hour will each produce:
6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 60 toys

Since there are two of them, together they produce:
60 toys * 2 = 120 toys

The other two workers who produce 4 toys an hour will each produce:
4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 40 toys

Since there are two of them, together they produce:
40 toys * 2 = 80 toys

The total number of toys produced by the four workers is:
120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order of 400 toys, which means that the four workers and the fifth worker together produced:
400 toys - 20 toys = 380 toys

Since the four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour

1. Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob and kept 9 for himself. This means Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers before giving any to Rob.

2. These 16 stickers were the half that Luis didn't use, so Luis originally had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.

3. The 32 stickers Luis had were the half that Seth gave him, so Seth originally had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To find out how many small bags John can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of M&M's John has by multiplying the number of large bags by the weight of each large bag.
2. Determine the total number of M&M's by multiplying the total weight by the number of M&M's per ounce.
3. Calculate the number of small bags by dividing the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag.

Let's do the math:

1. Total weight of M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces
2. Total number of M&M's: 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's
3. Number of small bags: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 small bags

So, John can make 90 small bags.

"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so:
   2nd fastest car speed = 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph
3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so:
   Fastest car speed = 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph

The fastest car goes 750 mph."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Liam is currently 16 years old.
2. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
3. At that time, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can write the equation: 14 = 2 * (Vince's age two years ago).
4. To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide Liam's age at that time by 2: 14 / 2 = 7.
5. This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago.
6. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age from two years ago: 7 + 2 = 9.

Vince is now 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call the number of eggs each of them painted ""A"".
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's call the number of eggs Camden painted ""C"" and the number of eggs Sarah painted ""S"".
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so we can write that as C = S + 12.
4. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, so we can write that as A + A + C + S = 56, or 2A + C + S = 56.

Now we can substitute the value of C from step 3 into the equation from step 4:

2A + (S + 12) + S = 56
2A + 2S + 12 = 56
2A + 2S = 56 - 12
2A + 2S = 44
A + S = 22

Since we know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs (C + S = 30), we can substitute C = S + 12 into this equation:

(S + 12) + S = 30
2S + 12 = 30
2S = 30 - 12
2S = 18
S = 9

Now that we know Sarah painted 9 eggs, we can find out how many Camden painted:

C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Now we can find out how many eggs Arnold painted by using the equation A + S = 22:

A + 9 = 22
A = 22 - 9
A = 13

Finally, we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

C - A = 21 - 13
C - A = 8

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes in ounces and then convert that weight to pounds.

First, we calculate the number of boxes Nik will need. Since he has 200 crayons and he wants to put them into groups of 8, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per group:

200 crayons / 8 crayons per group = 25 groups (or boxes)

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce:

200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes:

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

We then add the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes to get the total weight in ounces:

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:

400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

2. Determine how many 4-foot logs can be made from the usable length.
3. Calculate the total number of planks from all the logs.
4. Multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank to find the total earnings.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Usable length for logs: 80 feet * 80% = 80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet
2. Number of 4-foot logs: 64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs
3. Total number of planks: 16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks
4. Total earnings: 80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the brother's monthly earnings:
   Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:
   \( 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \) dollars per month.

2. Calculate their combined monthly earnings:
   Valerie's earnings + Brother's earnings = \( 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \) dollars per month.

3. Calculate the mother's monthly earnings:
   Since their mother earns twice their combined salary, she earns:
   \( 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \) dollars per month.

4. Calculate the total amount of money they all have together:
   Valerie's earnings + Brother's earnings + Mother's earnings = \( 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \) dollars per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Grandma to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk and add that to the 40 minutes she spends on the beach.

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed there is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, so we can calculate her speed on the beach as follows:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk at twice the speed:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{2v} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time for the 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to determine how much she has already saved and then calculate the difference to reach her goal.

Jane has saved $4 every week for the past 8 weeks. So, the total amount she has saved so far is:

$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Her goal is to save $60, so the remaining amount she needs to save is:

$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks it will take to save the remaining $28 is:

$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find out how many marbles Bob has initially, we can set up an equation based on the information that if he receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let \( x \) be the number of marbles Bob has initially. Then we can write the equation:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob has 36 marbles initially. If he loses 10 marbles, we can find out how many he will have left by subtracting 10 from 36:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the 33-degree water, results in a mixture that is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water, the temperature of the mixture can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures, where the weights are the volumes of water.

The formula for the temperature of the mixture \( T_{mix} \) is:

\[ T_{mix} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_{mix} \) must be at least 40 degrees, so we can set up the inequality:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

Now we solve for \( T \):

\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

\[ T \geq 200 - 132 \]

\[ T \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the water in the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the mixture.

Chickens added per day: 10
Number of days: 21

Cows after three weeks: 50 (initial) + 20 (daily) * 21 (days)
Chickens after three weeks: 20 (initial) + 10 (daily) * 21 (days)

Let's calculate the total for each:

Cows: 50 + 20 * 21 = 50 + 420 = 470
Chickens: 20 + 10 * 21 = 20 + 210 = 230

"To find the cost per bagel after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the discount applied, and then divide that total cost by the total number of bagels.

1. Calculate the total cost without the discount:
   4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00

2. Calculate the discount amount:
   10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted total:
   $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

4. Calculate the total number of bagels:
   4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels

5. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to get the cost per bagel:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So we calculate:

23 scoops - 5 scoops = 18 scoops

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are used to make a certain number of scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So we calculate:

6 potatoes - 3 potatoes = 3 potatoes
3 scoops - 1 scoop = 2 scoops

This means that 3 potatoes are used to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are used per scoop, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops:

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now, we can calculate how many potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying the number of scoops he ate by the number of potatoes per scoop:

18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes per scoop = 27 potatoes

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats and then convert that number into dozens.

First, we calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Next, we calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the following 30 days:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the two amounts to get the total number of eggs for 60 days:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens Chester will need:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

1. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. He sold this for $50.
2. 1/4 of 80 square meters is 20 square meters. He sold this for $30.
3. The remaining land is the original 80 square meters minus the 40 square meters and the 20 square meters he already sold, which is 20 square meters. He sold this for $3 per square meter, so 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, let's add up all the earnings:

$50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $60 (from the third sale) = $140

So, Abraham will be able to earn a total of $140 after selling all his unused land.

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the number of face masks Tyrion uses each time he goes out.
2. Multiply that by the number of times he goes out in a day.
3. Multiply the result by the number of days to get the total for 2 days.

Step 1: Tyrion uses 2 face masks each time he goes out.
Step 2: He goes out 3 times a day, so he uses 2 masks * 3 times = 6 masks per day.
Step 3: Over 2 days, he uses 6 masks/day * 2 days = 12 masks.

So, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is 12.

"To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by all the participants and subtract that from the total number of eggs Cole hid.

First, let's convert the number of eggs Cole hid from dozens to individual eggs:
3 dozen eggs = 3 * 12 = 36 eggs

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs each person found:
- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found:
5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs

Finally, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs Cole hid:
36 (total eggs) - 27 (eggs found) = 9 eggs

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections per week.
4. Calculate the total earnings per week.

Step 1: The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined.
- The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 * 2 = 400 apartments.
- The third complex is 60% bigger, so it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments.
- Therefore, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Step 2: The total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
- The total is 200 (first complex) + 200 (second complex) + 640 (third complex) = 1040 apartments.

Step 3: The total number of collections per week.
- John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections is 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

Step 4: The total earnings per week.
- John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his total earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

Therefore, John makes $1248 in a week.

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we will calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
5. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, which is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
6. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it produces 0 fruits.

Now, we need to calculate the total for the 10 years. We already have the numbers for years 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10. For the first four years, we assume the tree does not produce any fruit, as the information is not provided, and it is common for young avocado trees not to bear fruit. Therefore, the total number of fruits produced during the 10 years is the sum of the fruits produced from year 5 to year 10.

Total fruits = (0 + 0 + 0 + 0) + 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
Total fruits = 0 + 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000
Total fruits = 2350

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \), the length of the red rope as \( R \), and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope:
   \( R = 4B \)

2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \( B = Y - 7 \)

3. The combined length of the 3 ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \( R + B + Y = 37 \)

We can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the third equation:

\( 4B + B + Y = 37 \)

Since \( B = Y - 7 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the equation:

\( 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \)

Now, let's solve for \( Y \):

\( 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \)
\( 6Y - 35 = 37 \)
\( 6Y = 72 \)
\( Y = 12 \)

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \):

\( B = Y - 7 \)
\( B = 12 - 7 \)
\( B = 5 \)

Finally, we can find \( R \):

\( R = 4B \)
\( R = 4 \times 5 \)
\( R = 20 \)

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, which means Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's say each of them gave their little sister $x.

3. After giving $x to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. This means that Rissa's remaining money is 4/5 * $15.

We can set up the equation for Rissa's remaining money after giving $x to her sister:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Solving for x:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister.

4. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his sister. Ronnie originally had $5, so:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Ronnie is left with $2.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the amount of red paint as R, white paint as W, purple paint as P, and yellow paint as Y.

According to the problem:
- R = W = P (equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint)
- Y = 1/2 * total amount of paint (half the mural is yellow)
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, we can say that Y = 1/2 * 12 pints = 6 pints.

The remaining half of the mural is made up of red, white, and purple paint, which means:
R + W + P = 12 pints - 6 pints (the amount of yellow paint)
R + W + P = 6 pints

Since R = W = P, we can say that:
3R = 6 pints

Now we can solve for R:
R = 6 pints / 3
R = 2 pints

So, 2 pints of red paint was used.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then add them together.

First, we calculate the area of one bedroom:
20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area for the bedrooms is:
240 square feet/bedroom * 4 bedrooms = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:
240 square feet * 5 = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together to get the total area of the house:
960 square feet (bedrooms) + 1200 square feet (living room) + 1000 square feet (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

"To find out how many clouds Alice counted in total from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and then sum them up.

On Monday, she counts 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she counts double the number from Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she counts double the number from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts double the number from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts double the number from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, we add up all the clouds from each day to get the total:

3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 24 (Thursday) + 48 (Friday) = 93

So, the total number of clouds Alice counted from Monday to Friday is 93.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we need to first determine how many pods are in the special size box and then calculate the cost per pod.

A regular box has 100 pods and costs $12. The special size box has 20% more pods, so we calculate the number of additional pods:

20% of 100 pods = 0.20 * 100 = 20 pods

Therefore, the special size box has:

100 pods + 20 pods = 120 pods

The special size box also costs $12, so the cost per pod is:

$12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:

$1 / $0.10 per pod = 10 cycles

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he has, we divide $1000 by $20:
   \( \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \) bills.

2. He loses 10 of these $20 bills, so he has:
   \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill, so he uses:
   \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) bills, and he has 20 bills left.

4. The value of the 20 $20 bills he has left is:
   \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \) dollars.

5. Thomas then triples his money, so he has:
   \( 400 \times 3 = 1200 \) dollars.

6. He then converts all his money to $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:
   \( \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \) bills.

So, Thomas has 240 $5 bills.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

Second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, so team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Total goals:
- Team A's total goals = 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.
- Team B's total goals = 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of both teams' goals:
- Total goals = Team A's total goals + Team B's total goals = 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk before it is less than 2 inches, using 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

1. Start with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. On Monday, the teacher uses 45% of the chalk, so he uses 5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches.
3. After Monday, the remaining chalk is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.
4. Each subsequent day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.

We need to find out how many days it will take for the remaining chalk to be less than 2 inches.

Let's calculate the remaining chalk after each day:

- Day 1 (Tuesday): 2.75 * (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 * 0.80 = 2.20 inches
- Day 2 (Wednesday): 2.20 * (1 - 0.20) = 2.20 * 0.80 = 1.76 inches

After Wednesday, the chalk is less than 2 inches, so the teacher will have to recycle it.

Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 more days after Monday before he has to recycle it.

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate how many boys and girls are on varsity.

One-third of the girls are on varsity:
12 girls * 1/3 = 4 girls

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
12 boys * 1/4 = 3 boys

Now, we add the number of boys and girls on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students

The total number of students in the class is:
12 boys + 12 girls = 24 students

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
24 students - 7 students = 17 students

So, the number of students not on varsity is 17.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

James has 30 teeth in total, so the percentage of teeth the dentist fixes is (15 / 30) * 100.

Let's calculate that:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the first statement, we have:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
This is because Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.

From the second statement, we have:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]
This is because in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices of each type of pizza her friends will consume and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by her 6 friends:
6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices of cheese pizza

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we can determine the number of cheese pizzas needed:
36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by her 6 friends:
6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices of pepperoni pizza

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can determine the number of pepperoni pizzas needed:
24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas

Now, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 6 pizza pies in total.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour and then determine how long it will take him to reach 60 snowballs.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 sets of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs will melt 4 times in an hour, which is a total of 8 snowballs melted in an hour.

So, the net number of snowballs Jay can make in an hour is:
20 (built) - 8 (melted) = 12 snowballs per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to make 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour.

60 snowballs / 12 snowballs per hour = 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age difference between John and Jim and then use that information to find out how old Jim is now.

1. First, we need to determine how many years ago the 20th anniversary of Digimon was. Since the 20th anniversary has just occurred, we can assume that it is currently the 20th anniversary year.
2. If John is 28 years old now, we can calculate how old he was when Digimon came out by subtracting 20 years from his current age.
3. We know that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. We can use this information to find out Jim's age at that time.
4. Finally, we add 20 years to Jim's age at the time Digimon came out to find out how old he is now.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Current year is the 20th anniversary year of Digimon.
2. John's age when Digimon came out: 28 years - 20 years = 8 years.
3. Since John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, Jim's age at that time was 8 years / 2 = 4 years.
4. Jim's current age: 4 years + 20 years = 24 years.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
2. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages used and received over the three days:

- Total bandages used: 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) + 25 (third day) = 91 bandages.
- Total bandages received: 50 (first day) + 100 (third day) = 150 bandages.

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. To find out how many bandages they started with, we need to add the bandages used to the final count and subtract the bandages received:

Starting bandages = Bandages left at the end + Bandages used - Bandages received
Starting bandages = 78 + 91 - 150

Now, let's do the math:

Starting bandages = 169 - 150
Starting bandages = 19

So, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her regular earnings and the additional attendance bonus.

First, we calculate her regular earnings:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Regular earnings per day = 7.5 hours * $1.5/hour
Regular earnings per week = Regular earnings per day * 6 days/week
Regular earnings for April = Regular earnings per week * 4 weeks

Now, we add the attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for each week of complete attendance.
- Since there are 4 weeks in April and she had no absences, she will receive the bonus for all 4 weeks.

Total attendance bonus for April = $10/week * 4 weeks

Total earnings for April = Regular earnings for April + Total attendance bonus for April

Let's do the math:

Regular earnings per day = 7.5 * 1.5 = $11.25
Regular earnings per week = 11.25 * 6 = $67.50
Regular earnings for April = 67.50 * 4 = $270.00

Total attendance bonus for April = 10 * 4 = $40.00

Total earnings for April = 270.00 + 40.00 = $310.00

"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times:

- In the morning, 50 people entered.
- At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
- After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
- By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (in the morning) had entered, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after a while) + 150 (evening) = 320

"To find out how many pens Alain has, we need to calculate the total number of red and black pens.

First, we calculate the number of red pens:
- Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
- Each pack has 5 pens.
- Therefore, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 pens.

Next, we calculate the number of black pens:
- Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens.
- Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought 2 * 5 = 10 packs of black pens.
- Each pack has 5 pens.
- Therefore, the total number of black pens is 10 packs * 5 pens/pack = 50 pens.

Finally, we add the number of red and black pens to find the total number of pens:
- Total pens = number of red pens + number of black pens
- Total pens = 25 pens + 50 pens = 75 pens.

So, Alain has 75 pens in total.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.
   - The cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

2. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.
   - He buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

3. The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch.
   - The cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 50%) = $60 + $30 = $90.

4. The total cost for the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1800.

5. The total amount spent on everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac.
   - Total cost = $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.

So, the total amount John spends on everything is $2400.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees in total over the two days.
- He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. 1/4 of 40 is 10, so he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's add up all the trees he planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30 trees.
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120 trees.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons were left.
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons were left.
4. His friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons were left.
5. On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, including Fred, so there were 3 + 1 (Fred) = 4 people in total.
6. The remaining 8 gallons of root beer were shared equally among the 4 people.

To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people:

8 gallons / 4 people = 2 gallons per person

So, each person had 2 gallons of root beer available to drink during the party.

"To find out how many fish have red stripes and blue stripes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
2. Subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total to find the number of remaining fish.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes to get the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Number of fish with red stripes:
   \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 66 fish = \( \frac{66}{3} \) = 22 fish

2. Number of remaining fish:
   66 fish - 22 fish = 44 fish

3. Number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish:
   \( \frac{5}{11} \) of 44 fish = \( \frac{5 \times 44}{11} \) = \( \frac{220}{11} \) = 20 fish

4. Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:
   22 fish (red stripes) + 20 fish (blue stripes) = 42 fish

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.
2. She also had three makeup sets with six eyeshadow colors each, so that's 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.
3. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so Amy loses 4 colors, leaving her with 8 - 4 = 4 colors from the remaining palette.
4. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, so she uses 6 / 2 = 3 colors from that set.
5. After using up 3 colors from one makeup set, she has 6 - 3 = 3 colors left from that set.
6. The other two makeup sets are untouched, so she still has 2 * 6 = 12 colors from those sets.

Now, let's add up all the colors Amy has left:

- 4 colors from the remaining palette
- 3 colors from the partially used makeup set
- 12 colors from the two untouched makeup sets

So, Amy has 4 + 3 + 12 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find out how high the roof is from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the house and the height of the first floor, then subtract the first floor's height from the total height of the house.

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. The house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so the house's height is 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches.
3. The first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the first floor's height is 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches.

The height from the second floor's floor to the roof is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:

420 inches (total height) - 180 inches (first floor height) = 240 inches.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance walked by the dogs. The average distance is the total distance walked by all the dogs divided by the number of dogs.

Let's denote the distance the last dog needs to walk as \( x \) miles.

The total distance walked by all the dogs is the sum of the distances each dog walks:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x \]

Since the average distance walked per day is 3 miles and there are 4 dogs, the total distance walked by all the dogs is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So we can set up the equation:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12 \]

Now we solve for \( x \):

"John's house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that value. 

First, we calculate the loan amount:
$250,000 * 40% = $250,000 * 0.40 = $100,000

Next, we calculate the amount he uses to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan:
$100,000 * 60% = $100,000 * 0.60 = $60,000

To find out how much money he has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the debt payment from the total loan amount:

Let's calculate the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27.

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the total capacity of the classes in each school and then add them together.

First, let's find the capacity of each of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

120 students / 8 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

15 students/class * 2 classes = 30 students

Now, let's add the capacity of Ali's school, which is just the capacity of his one class:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Stephen owes after adding the 2% interest, and then subtract the amount he has already paid over the 11 months.

First, let's calculate the total amount including the interest:
Interest = 2% of $300
Interest = 0.02 * $300
Interest = $6

Total amount to be paid back = Principal + Interest
Total amount to be paid back = $300 + $6
Total amount to be paid back = $306

Next, we calculate the amount Stephen has paid over the 11 months:
Monthly payment = $25
Total paid over 11 months = 11 * $25
Total paid over 11 months = $275

Now, we subtract the amount already paid from the total amount to find out what Stephen will pay in the twelfth month:
Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Total amount to be paid back - Total paid over 11 months
Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = $306 - $275
Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = $31

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the total number of jelly beans he estimated to be in the jar and then find out how many of those he estimated to be red. We can then compare his estimate of the number of red jelly beans to the true number, which is 900.

First, we calculate the volume of the jar:
Volume of the jar = base area * height
Volume of the jar = 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches
Volume of the jar = 36 * 15
Volume of the jar = 540 cubic inches

Next, we calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans, taking into account the packing efficiency:
Effective volume = volume of the jar * packing efficiency
Effective volume = 540 cubic inches * 80%
Effective volume = 540 * 0.8
Effective volume = 432 cubic inches

Now, we calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:
Total number of jelly beans = effective volume / volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
Estimated number of red jelly beans = total number of jelly beans * 30%
Estimated number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 30%
Estimated number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Estimated number of red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900, so we can now find out how far off Tim's guess was:
Difference = true number of red jelly beans - estimated number of red jelly beans
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits for 5 years.
   - Total cost before the increase = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years.

2. **After the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit has increased by 150%.
   - The new cost of one visit = $2 + ($2 * 150%) = $2 + $3 = $5.
   - She continues to visit 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total cost after the increase = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for both periods and sum them up.

**Before the increase:**
3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = 3 * 2 * 5 = $30.

**After the increase:**
3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = 3 * 5 * 3 = $45.

**Total cost:**

"To find out how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of ground beef are needed for 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the number of pounds of ground beef.

Step 1: Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs he wants to make by the number of meatballs per pound to find out how many pounds of meat he needs.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Step 2: Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. So, we multiply the number of pounds of ground beef by the amount of seasoning per pound.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the number of cupcakes Carly makes be \( c \).
2. According to the problem, the number of brownies Carly makes is 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes, which can be expressed as \( 3c - 2 \).
3. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats, so the total number of treats needed is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).
4. The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies, which is \( c + (3c - 2) \).

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after the 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after the 50% decrease.

Step 1: December price increase
The price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price in December is:
\[ \text{December Price} = \text{November Price} + (\text{November Price} \times 80\%) \]
\[ \text{December Price} = 40 + (40 \times 0.80) \]
\[ \text{December Price} = 40 + 32 \]
\[ \text{December Price} = 72 \]

Step 2: January price decrease
The price in January is 50% less than the December price:
\[ \text{January Price} = \text{December Price} - (\text{December Price} \times 50\%) \]
\[ \text{January Price} = 72 - (72 \times 0.50) \]
\[ \text{January Price} = 72 - 36 \]
\[ \text{January Price} = 36 \]

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider the different rates for his lessons.

For the standard rate lessons:
- He charges $80 per hour.
- He has 4 of these lessons.
- The total for these lessons is 4 * $80.

For the veteran rate lessons:
- He reduces his rate by 25%, so the veteran rate is 75% of the standard rate.
- The veteran rate is 0.75 * $80.
- He has 2 of these lessons.
- The total for these lessons is 2 * (0.75 * $80).

Now, let's calculate the total amount:

Standard rate lessons total: 4 * $80 = $320
Veteran rate lessons total: 2 * (0.75 * $80) = 2 * $60 = $120

Total for the day: $320 + $120 = $440

"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate:

He ate 2/5 of the 60 apples, which is:
\( \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \) apples.

Now, let's find out how many apples were left after he ate 24 of them:

60 - 24 = 36 apples remaining.

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples:

25% of 36 is:
\( \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 9 \) apples.

So, after giving 9 apples to his sister, the number of apples left is:

36 - 9 = 27 apples.

Finally, Walter sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each, so the total amount of money he received is:

27 apples \(\times\) $3/apple = $81.

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given. If 9 novels represent 3/4 of the number of novels she has written this year, we can represent the total number of novels she has written this year as \( x \).

The equation would be:

\[ \frac{3}{4}x = 9 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \):

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ x = 3 \times 4 \]

\[ x = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then divide it by the total distance between Alaska and Texas, and finally multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

First, we calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days. Since he is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (which is unlikely, but we'll use this for the sake of the calculation), the total hours traveled in 3 days would be:

3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance he has covered:

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance covered = 3600 km

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that he has covered:

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"To find the percentage of the day the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time the custodian has to clean in minutes over 5 days.
2. Calculate the total time the custodian works in minutes over 5 days.
3. Divide the total cleaning time by the total working time to get the fraction of the day spent cleaning.
4. Convert the fraction to a percentage.

Step 1: Total cleaning time
- There are 80 classrooms.
- It takes 15 minutes to clean each classroom.
- Total cleaning time = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.

Step 2: Total working time
- The custodian works 8 hours a day.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Total working time per day = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day.
- Over 5 days, the total working time = 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes.

Step 3: Fraction of the day spent cleaning
- Fraction of the day spent cleaning = Total cleaning time / Total working time over 5 days.
- Fraction of the day spent cleaning = 1200 minutes / 2400 minutes = 0.5.

Step 4: Convert the fraction to a percentage
- Percentage of the day spent cleaning = Fraction of the day spent cleaning * 100%.
- Percentage of the day spent cleaning = 0.5 * 100% = 50%.

The custodian spends 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms.

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold.

Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so together they can hold:
2 shelves * 10 books/shelf = 20 books

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold:
2 * 10 books = 20 books

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold:
20 books - 5 books = 15 books

Now, we add up the total number of books that one bookcase can hold:
20 books (middle shelves) + 20 books (bottom shelf) + 15 books (top shelf) = 55 books

Elly has 110 books in total. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:
110 books / 55 books/bookcase = 2 bookcases

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To calculate Rose's profit, we need to determine her total cost and her total revenue, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, we calculate the total cost of the eggs:
- Rose bought five dozens of eggs.
- Each dozen costs $2.40.
- Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so five dozens contain 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.
- Rose sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for 3 eggs.
- To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell, we divide the total number of eggs by 3: 60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets.
- Total revenue = 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00.

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

Rose's profit is $8.00.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests, and then subtract the number of questions she already got right on the first test.

First, let's find out the total number of questions across both tests:
- The first test has 70 questions.
- The second test has 40 questions.
- Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

Next, we calculate the number of questions she needs to get right to pass, which is 70% of the total questions:
- 70% of 110 questions = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, let's see how many questions she got right on the first test:
- She got 60% of the 70 questions correct.
- 60% of 70 questions = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right:
- Questions needed on the second test = 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):

\[ B = 5 \times 20 - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many customers need to come into the dealership to sell 15 cars. Since for every 2 customers, 1 buys a car, we can set up the following ratio:
   2 customers : 1 car = x customers : 15 cars

   Solving for x gives us:
   x = 15 cars * 2 customers / 1 car
   x = 30 customers

   So, Jason needs 30 customers to come into the dealership to sell 15 cars.

2. Next, we need to find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 customers to come into the dealership. Since for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in, we can set up the following ratio:
   25 calls : 1 customer = y calls : 30 customers

   Solving for y gives us:
   y = 30 customers * 25 calls / 1 customer
   y = 750 calls

   Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to get 30 customers to come into the dealership, which should result in the sale of 15 cars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles that Brianna's family has.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights:
- There is 1 flashlight for each of the 4 people.
- There are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms.

So the total number of flashlights is:
4 (for the people) + 2 * 8 (for the rooms) = 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles:
- There are 4 small candles for half the rooms, which is 4 rooms.
- There are 5 medium candles for the other half of the rooms, which is also 4 rooms.

So the total number of candles is:
4 * 4 (small candles for 4 rooms) + 5 * 4 (medium candles for 4 rooms) = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together:
20 (flashlights) + 36 (candles) = 56 items in total.

"To solve this, let's break down the time it takes for John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they each take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so they each take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

The total time is the sum of the times for each side:

5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

Since solving the fifth side completes the cube, we don't need to add time for a sixth side. Therefore, the total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find out how long it would take John to speak 10 pages after his training, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
2. Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.
3. Calculate the time it would take to speak those words at the new speed.

Step 1: John's new speaking speed
John's new speed is 2.5 times his starting speed of 150 WPM.
New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Step 2: Total number of words in 10 pages
Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages would have:
Total words = 450 words/page * 10 pages = 4500 words

Step 3: Time to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM
Time (in minutes) = Total words / Speed in WPM
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim will need, we need to calculate the amount of lemon juice required for the pool party and for the extra gallon that Allen requested.

For the pool party, Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade. Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, 4 gallons will require 4 cups of lemon juice.

For Allen's extra gallon that is twice as tart, Tim will need 2 cups of lemon juice (since it's twice as tart as the regular gallon which requires 1 cup).

So, in total, Tim will need 4 cups (for the pool party) + 2 cups (for Allen) = 6 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, for 6 cups of juice, Tim will need 6 lemons/cup * 6 cups = 36 lemons.

"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed for a week, we need to first determine the daily consumption for all the dogs and then multiply by 7 days.

For the German Shepherds:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kilograms per day = 15 kilograms per day

For the Bulldogs:
2 Bulldogs * 3 kilograms per day = 6 kilograms per day

Total daily consumption for all dogs:
15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms per day

Total weekly consumption:
21 kilograms per day * 7 days = 147 kilograms per week

"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2, since a pair consists of 2 legs.

First, we calculate the total number of legs for the 2-legged animals:
10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

Next, we calculate the total number of legs for the 4-legged animals:
15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Now, we add the total number of legs together:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Finally, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the number of pairs:

"To find the number of red blocks, we first need to determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks.

There are 4 blue blocks. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, there are:
2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks.

Now, we can add the number of blue and yellow blocks together:
4 (blue) + 8 (yellow) = 12 blocks.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, we can find the number of red blocks by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total:
32 (total) - 12 (blue and yellow) = 20 red blocks.

So, the number of red blocks is:

"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each direction and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the distance he traveled west:
Distance west = Speed * Time west
Distance west = 18 mph * 5 hours
Distance west = 90 miles

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled east:
Distance east = Speed * Time east
Distance east = 18 mph * 8 hours
Distance east = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled east after traveling west, the distance he is from his house is the difference between the distance east and the distance west:
Distance from house = Distance east - Distance west
Distance from house = 144 miles - 90 miles
Distance from house = 54 miles

Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

"To calculate the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to apply the depreciation rate for each year to the value of the boat at the beginning of that year.

1. After the first year, the boat depreciates by 30%. The value after the first year is:
   Value after 1st year = Original value - (Depreciation rate * Original value)
   Value after 1st year = $9000 - (0.30 * $9000)
   Value after 1st year = $9000 - $2700
   Value after 1st year = $6300

2. After the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30%. The value after the second year is:
   Value after 2nd year = Value after 1st year - (Depreciation rate * Value after 1st year)
   Value after 2nd year = $6300 - (0.30 * $6300)
   Value after 2nd year = $6300 - $1890
   Value after 2nd year = $4410

3. After the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%. The value after the third year is:
   Value after 3rd year = Value after 2nd year - (Depreciation rate * Value after 2nd year)
   Value after 3rd year = $4410 - (0.20 * $4410)
   Value after 3rd year = $4410 - $882
   Value after 3rd year = $3528

So, the boat is worth $3528 after the three years.

"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stays and the cost of the bus rides, and then add them together.

The cost of one night at the hotel is $80. Since Helen stayed for 3 nights, the total cost for the hotel is:
3 nights * $80/night = $240

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, the cost of one bus trip is:
10% of $80 = 0.10 * $80 = $8

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus rides is:
7 rides * $8/ride = $56

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus rides to find the total amount Helen paid:
$240 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $296

Therefore, Helen paid $296 for the hotel and bus travels during that trip.

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas originally had before dropping 4 of them. 

Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, so before dropping them, Dallas had:

21 marbles + 4 marbles = 25 marbles

Since Mazie had 52 marbles in total and gave all of them to the twins, and we know Dallas received 25 of them, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles:

52 marbles - 25 marbles = 27 marbles

So, Mazie gave Darla 27 marbles.

"To calculate the force John needs to push the car, we need to first determine the total weight of the car including the luggage and the children. Then we will calculate 1% of that total weight to find the force required.

The total weight is the sum of the car's weight, the luggage, and the two children:

Car weight: 1200 pounds
Luggage weight: 250 pounds
Children's weight: 75 pounds each, so for two children: 75 * 2 = 150 pounds

Total weight = Car weight + Luggage weight + Children's weight
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Now, the force required is 1% of the total weight:

Force required = 1% of 1600 pounds
Force required = 0.01 * 1600
Force required = 16 pounds

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and 16 years younger than Emma, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16 years
Emma's age = 40 years + 16 years
Emma's age = 56 years

Now that we have both ages, we can calculate the average:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 years + 56 years) / 2
Average age = 96 years / 2
Average age = 48 years

"To calculate the total cost for the place settings, we need to multiply the cost of each type of plate and bowl by the number of guests, and then sum up the total.

Dinner plates cost $6.00 each, so for 12 people, the cost will be:
12 * $6.00 = $72.00

Bowls cost $5.00 each, so for 12 people, the cost will be:
12 * $5.00 = $60.00

Salad plates cost $4.00 each, so for 12 people, the cost will be:
12 * $4.00 = $48.00

Now, we add up the costs for all the items:
$72.00 + $60.00 + $48.00 = $180.00

Therefore, Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week and then subtract that from the 300 pounds of feed Dexter ordered.

1. First, we calculate the daily feed consumption for one pig:
   - Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day, so one pig eats 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of feed per day.

2. Next, we calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:
   - If one pig eats 8 pounds of feed per day, then five pigs will eat 8 * 5 = 40 pounds of feed per day.

3. Now, we calculate the weekly feed consumption for all five pigs:
   - If the five pigs eat 40 pounds of feed per day, then in a week (7 days) they will eat 40 * 7 = 280 pounds of feed.

4. Finally, we subtract the total weekly feed consumption from the amount of feed Dexter ordered:
   - Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so after a week, the amount of feed left will be 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total earnings from selling cupcakes and cookies, and then subtract the cost of the trays she bought.

First, we calculate the earnings from the cupcakes:
20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40

Next, we calculate the earnings from the cookies:
40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40

Now, we add the earnings from cupcakes and cookies to get the total earnings:
$40 (from cupcakes) + $40 (from cookies) = $80

Then, we calculate the cost of the trays:
5 trays * $4/tray = $20

Finally, we subtract the cost of the trays from the total earnings to find out how much money Frances has left:
$80 (total earnings) - $20 (cost of trays) = $60

So, Frances has $60 left.

"To find out how much time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week she meditates for 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, she will meditate for 210 minutes * 4 = 840 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week, so that's 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours per week.
- In 4 weeks, she will practice yoga for 5 hours * 4 = 20 hours.

Now, we need to convert the hours of yoga into minutes to add it to the meditation time:
- 20 hours of yoga is equal to 20 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1200 minutes.

Finally, we add the time spent on meditation and yoga:
- 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes.

So, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent 2040 minutes on meditation and yoga practice.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we calculate 50% of the small sunflower's seeds and add that to the number of seeds in the small sunflower:
50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 seeds = 18 seeds

So, the large sunflower has:
36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:
36 seeds (small) + 54 seeds (large) = 90 seeds

"To find out how tall Jackie was before the summer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Anne's height.
2. Calculate Jackie's current height.
3. Subtract the growth over the summer to find Jackie's height before the summer.

Step 1: Anne's height
Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, and Albert is 36"" tall, Anne's height is:
Anne's height = 2 * Albert's height
Anne's height = 2 * 36""
Anne's height = 72""

Step 2: Jackie's current height
Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so:
Jackie's current height = Anne's height - 2""
Jackie's current height = 72"" - 2""
Jackie's current height = 70""

Step 3: Jackie's height before the summer
Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so to find her height before the summer, we subtract 3"" from her current height:
Jackie's height before summer = Jackie's current height - 3""
Jackie's height before summer = 70"" - 3""
Jackie's height before summer = 67""

So, Jackie was 67"" tall before the summer.

1. First, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation.
   - The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

2. Next, we need to determine the net number of holes filled by Nate each day after he returns.
   - Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night.
   - Net holes filled per day = 9 holes/day - 6 holes/night = 3 holes/day.

3. Now, we need to calculate how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day.
   - Days to fill all holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day = 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

4. Finally, we need to convert the number of days into weeks.
   - Weeks to fill all holes = Days to fill all holes / 7 days/week = 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.

So, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

The average enrollment at Butler High School is 3/4 of the enrollment at Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, we can calculate Butler High School's enrollment as follows:

Butler High School enrollment = 3/4 * Norman High School enrollment
Butler High School enrollment = 3/4 * 4000
Butler High School enrollment = 3000

Now, to find out how much greater the enrollment at Norman High School is, we subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

Norman High School enrollment - Butler High School enrollment = 4000 - 3000 = 1000

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - Rainbow cookies - Oatmeal cookies
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 5670
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

"To find out how many beakers Igor lost, let's break down the information given:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.
- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which is 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
- Igor picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7, but lost some on the way.
- The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor should have placed on the lab bench if he hadn't lost any beakers:

8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) = 31 items.

Since the total number of items on the lab bench was 29, we can determine the number of beakers lost by subtracting the actual number of items from the expected number of items:

31 (expected items) - 29 (actual items) = 2 beakers lost.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws he will use for the tables and then subtract that from the number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table will need:
4 legs/table * 2 screws/leg = 8 screws/table

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed will be:
4 tables * 8 screws/table = 32 screws

James has 40 screws, so the number of screws he will have left over will be:
40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws

"To find out how much money the girls raised in total, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then sum those amounts.

First, we know that Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised:
$430 + $320 = $750

Sarah raised $300.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised:
$300 + $400 = $700

Now we can add up the amounts raised by each girl to get the total:
Alexandra: $430
Kim: $750
Sarah: $300
Maryam: $700

Total raised: $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it took for Vanessa to run her part of the race. We know that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.

First, let's find out how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and that is twice the distance Aaron ran, Aaron must have run 2 miles.

Next, we need to find out how long it took Aaron to run 1 mile. Since Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes, it took him 16 / 2 = 8 minutes to run 1 mile.

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, it means that Vanessa takes twice as long to run a mile. Therefore, it takes Vanessa 8 * 2 = 16 minutes to run 1 mile.

Now, we can calculate the time it took Vanessa to run her 4 miles. Since it takes her 16 minutes to run 1 mile, it will take her 16 * 4 = 64 minutes to run 4 miles.

The final answer is:

"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply 200 feet by 3:

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line/foot of dock = 600 feet of line

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract that from the total required:

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To calculate how much Tom's restaurant makes a week from reservations, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of one reservation.
2. Calculate the total income from reservations per night.
3. Calculate the total income from reservations per week.

Step 1: Total cost of one reservation
Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.
Total cost per reservation = (2 meals * $5) + $5 bottle of wine
Total cost per reservation = $10 + $5
Total cost per reservation = $15

Step 2: Total income from reservations per night
The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
Total income per night = 6 reservations * $15 per reservation
Total income per night = $90

Step 3: Total income from reservations per week
The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
Total income per week = 2 days * $90 per night
Total income per week = $180

So, the restaurant makes $180 a week from reservations.

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons, and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

The vendor made a profit of 25%, so the total selling price is 125% of the cost price.

The cost price for 50 watermelons is $80.

The total selling price is:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} \times (1 + \text{Profit Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \$80 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \$80 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \$100 \]

Now, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\$100}{50} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \$2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, which means she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
2. James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
3. John had James when he was 19, so John is now 18 + 19 = 37 years old.
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.
5. In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, we convert an hour into minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes

Next, we calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges

Then, we calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Mark gets the radiator for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original price. The original price is $400, so he pays:

$400 * 20% = $400 * 0.20 = $80 for the radiator.

The mechanic charges $50 per hour for 3 hours, so the labor cost is:

$50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost for the radiator and the labor is:

$80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens,
- \( k \) as the number of cows.

We know that:
1. The total number of animals (chickens and cows) is 20, so:
   \( c + k = 20 \)

2. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70, so:
   \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( c \) and \( k \).

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \( c + 2k = 35 \)

Now we have the system:
   \( c + k = 20 \)
   \( c + 2k = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
   \( (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \)
   \( c + 2k - c - k = 15 \)
   \( k = 15 \)

Now that we know there are 15 cows, we can substitute \( k \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
   \( c + 15 = 20 \)
   \( c = 20 - 15 \)
   \( c = 5 \)

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to calculate the total number of slices and then divide that number by the number of people.

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person gets, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:
56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

So, each person can have 14 slices.
