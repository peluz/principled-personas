"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the new value of the house after repairs:**
   - The original purchase price of the house is $80,000.
   - The repairs cost $50,000.
   - The total investment in the house is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

2. **Determine the increased value of the house:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.
   - 150% of the original purchase price ($80,000) is calculated as:
     \[
     1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
     \]
   - Therefore, the new value of the house is:
     \[
     80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - The profit is the new value of the house minus the total investment:
     \[
     200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000
     \]

Thus, Josh's profit is $70,000.

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed required for the entire day for all the chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, calculate the total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens:
- Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
  \[
  3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups}
  \]

Next, calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
- The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
  \[
  15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
  \]

Finally, determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
- Subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement:
  \[
  60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
  \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first glass and every second glass:
- The cost of the first glass is $5.
- The cost of the second glass is $3.

Since this pattern repeats, we can group the glasses into pairs:
- Each pair of glasses costs $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, which is 8 pairs of glasses:
- The total cost for 8 pairs is 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Thus, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance John initially travels:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Determine the distance John needs to travel to get back home:**
   - The distance to get back home is the same as the distance he initially traveled, which is 180 miles.

3. **Calculate the distance John covers during the 4 hours of his return trip:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

4. **Calculate the total distance John covers during the 4 hours of his return trip:**
   - Total distance covered = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

5. **Determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours:**
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance covered = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours.

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to first determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average of these three guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each day.
2. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week.

First, we calculate the daily total:
- John takes care of 10 dogs.
- Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.
- Therefore, the total time spent per day is \( 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \).

Next, we calculate the weekly total:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the total time spent per week is \( 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \).

Thus, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time available is 6 hours.
   - She spends one-third of the time running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - She spends two-thirds of the time walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Polly's throwing distance without the gemstone:**
   - Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone.

2. **Calculate Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:**
   - When holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther.
   - Therefore, her throwing distance with the gemstone is \( 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \).

3. **Determine the dragon's reach:**
   - The dragon can breathe fire up to a distance of 1000 feet.

4. **Calculate the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon:**
   - Polly needs to stand far enough to be outside the dragon's 1000 feet reach but still within her 1200 feet throwing distance.
   - The distance outside the dragon's reach is \( 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \).

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it notes in the purse**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it notes used at work**: She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.
3. **Post-it notes remaining**: After placing the Post-it notes on the cups, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes Candice had before using them is the sum of the initial Post-it notes and the Post-it notes in the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

The number of Post-it notes used is 220, and the number of Post-it notes remaining is 23. Therefore, the equation representing the total number of Post-it notes is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. The cost of each blue tie is $40, so the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to break down the components and then sum them up.

1. **Number of schools**: 4
2. **Teams per school**: 2 (one girls' team and one boys' team)
3. **Players per team**: 5
4. **Coaches per team**: 1

First, calculate the total number of players:
- Each school has 2 teams, and each team has 5 players.
- Therefore, each school has \(2 \times 5 = 10\) players.
- Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

The total number of students is 200. According to the problem, 2/5 of the students are boys. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Next, we find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

The problem states that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Thus, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda’s last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - The sauce loses half its volume when cooked, so the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking must be twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Initial volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of cans of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - Number of cans used = Initial volume of tomatoes / Volume per can = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Total number of tomatoes used = Number of cans * Tomatoes per can = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Let's break down the information given:

1. Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes:
\[ x + 20 \]

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (those that took an exit).

The total number of cars that were originally on the motorway is 30. Therefore, the equation representing the total number of cars is:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

**Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.**

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.

\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L \approx 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

**Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary four years later increased by 40% from his salary four years ago.

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 56000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.**

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we need to find the percentage increase in Adrien's salary and apply it to Lylah's salary.

Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 12307.692 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} \approx 43076.92 \]

**Step 4: Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.**

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary four years later} \approx 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $99,076.92.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons (the number of spoons in this package is what we need to find).
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. Julia had 12 spoons left when setting the table.

Let \( x \) be the number of spoons in the package Julia bought.

The total number of spoons Julia had before using any is:
\[ x + 5 \]

After using 3 spoons, the number of spoons left is:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 \]

We know that after using the spoons, Julia had 12 spoons left:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total length of all the baked goods in inches and then convert that total to feet.

1. **Calculate the total length of the rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Total length of rolls = 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.

2. **Calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants.
   - Total length of croissants = 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.

3. **Calculate the total length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long, which is 24 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches).
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Total length of baguettes = 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches.

4. **Calculate the total length of all baked goods in inches:**
   - Total length = 1200 inches (rolls) + 720 inches (croissants) + 1440 inches (baguettes) = 3360 inches.

5. **Convert the total length from inches to feet:**
   - 1 foot = 12 inches.
   - Total length in feet = 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet.

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for all the apes combined:

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Adding these together gives the total monthly requirement:
200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we multiply the monthly requirement by 2:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities:
     \[
     \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

4. **Expressing the result as a percentage:**
   - To express this as a percentage, we convert the ratio to a percentage:
     \[
     2 \times 100\% = 200\%
     \]

Therefore, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage based on the total distribution of straw.

1. **Calculate the total straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces of straw.

2. **Calculate the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw distributed.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces of straw.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - Total straw distributed = 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters = 50 pieces.
   - Straw used for rabbits = 20 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = 160 pieces - 50 pieces - 20 pieces = 90 pieces of straw.

4. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total number of rats = 90 pieces / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats.

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Number of rats in each cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To determine how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is invested or borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% monthly interest)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]

Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first:

\[ 1 + 0.02 = 1.02 \]

Now, raise 1.02 to the power of 3:

\[ 1.02^3 = 1.061208 \]

Finally, multiply this result by the principal amount:

\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict:

\[ 106.12 \]

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now (in gallons).
Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now (in gallons).

We know that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, 4 minutes ago, each pool had 16 more gallons of water (since \( 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons} \)).

So, 4 minutes ago:
- The big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.
- The small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Since her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount.

The additional 10% of $2000 is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months if she pays $165 each month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:

   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
1. Harriet's age in three years:
   \[
   21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
   \]
2. Adrian's age in three years:
   \[
   63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Zack's age in three years:
   \[
   42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:

"To determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we first need to calculate the number of cookies each of them ate on both days and then convert those numbers into calories.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday.**
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister.
- Therefore, Sue ate \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cookies on Monday.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Tuesday.**
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister.
- Therefore, Sue ate \( 2 \times 13 = 26 \) cookies on Tuesday.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.**
- Sue's total cookies: \( 20 \) (Monday) + \( 26 \) (Tuesday) = \( 46 \) cookies.
- Sister's total cookies: \( 5 \) (Monday) + \( 13 \) (Tuesday) = \( 18 \) cookies.

**Step 4: Convert the number of cookies into calories.**
- Each cookie has 200 calories.
- Sue's total calories: \( 46 \times 200 = 9200 \) calories.
- Sister's total calories: \( 18 \times 200 = 3600 \) calories.

**Step 5: Calculate the difference in calories consumed.**
- Difference in calories: \( 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \) calories.

Thus, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister.

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate it:**
   - The tree is 200 feet tall.
   - Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
   - The number of 10-foot sections in a 200-foot tree is \( \frac{200}{10} = 20 \) sections.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the tree is \( 20 \times 400 = 8000 \) pounds.

2. **Calculate the weight of the wood eaten by the termites:**
   - The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
   - 30% of 8000 pounds is \( 0.30 \times 8000 = 2400 \) pounds.

3. **Calculate the remaining weight of the tree:**
   - The remaining weight is the original weight minus the weight eaten by the termites.

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \)
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
4. Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_a = 52 \)

First, we use the information that Andrea has 52 apples to find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we use the number of apples Jamal has to find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we use the number of bananas Jamal has to find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time for each type of hole and then sum these times.

1. **Calculate the time for small holes:**
   - Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
   - For 30 small holes, the total time is:
     \[
     30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time for large holes:**
   - Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
   - For 15 large holes, the total time is:
     \[
     15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Sum the total time for both types of holes:**
   - Total time in minutes:
     \[
     90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To determine the total number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum over a period of fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and new legs separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of new arms:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new arms is calculated by dividing 15 by 3.
   - \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \) new arms.

2. **Calculate the number of new legs:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new legs is calculated by dividing 15 by 5.
   - \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \) new legs.

3. **Calculate the total number of new limbs:**
   - Add the number of new arms and new legs.
   - \( 5 + 3 = 8 \) new limbs.

Therefore, after fifteen days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, the cost of the flight ticket:
$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

Adding up all these expenses:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
$6000 (total money) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we first need to calculate the daily egg consumption and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

1. Identify the number of people eating 3 eggs each day:
   - 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
   - Total eggs consumed by these 3 people each day = 3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs.

2. Identify the number of people eating 2 eggs each day:
   - The family has 5 people in total, so the remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.
   - Total eggs consumed by these 2 people each day = 2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs.

3. Calculate the total daily egg consumption:
   - Total eggs consumed each day = 9 eggs (from the 3 people) + 4 eggs (from the 2 people) = 13 eggs.

4. Calculate the total weekly egg consumption:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information about Noah and Cera's ages and the population of Chile six years ago.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60,000 \times 2 = 120,000\).

The current population of Chile is:

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening Effect of Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

3. Calculate the monthly pay for senior programmers.
4. Calculate the total monthly pay for all junior programmers.
5. Calculate the total monthly pay for all senior programmers.
6. Sum the total monthly pay for both junior and senior programmers.

**Step 1: Determine the number of junior programmers.**

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. The total number of employees is 100.

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of senior programmers.**

The total number of employees is 100, and we have already determined that 40 are junior programmers. Therefore, the number of senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the monthly pay for senior programmers.**

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.

\[
\text{Monthly pay for senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total monthly pay for all junior programmers.**

\[
\text{Total monthly pay for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the total monthly pay for all senior programmers.**

\[
\text{Total monthly pay for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000

"To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June after taking his coach's advice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day based on the coach's advice.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after the increase.
3. Calculate the total distance run over the month of June.

**Step 1: Calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day.**

The coach wants Tyson to run \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more meters in a day. Tyson's original daily distance is 5000 meters.

\[
\text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters}

   - The train makes this trip 3 times a day:
     \[
     300 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips/day} = 900 \text{ miles/day}
     \]

4. **Determine how many days the train can operate before reaching 18,000 miles:**
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it can operate before reaching this distance, we divide the total service interval by the daily distance:
     \[
     \frac{18,000 \text{ miles}}{900 \text{ miles/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
     \]

Thus, the train goes between services every 20 days.

"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Mary has 30 sheep.
2. Half of the sheep (30 / 2 = 15) give 1 kg of milk each.
3. The other half (30 / 2 = 15) give 2 kg of milk each.

Now, calculate the total milk from each group:
- Milk from the first group: 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg
- Milk from the second group: 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Add the milk from both groups to get the total daily milk collection:
- Total milk = 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land equals 12.8 hectares.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. Then:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles each person has based on the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

The total number of popsicles is 165. To find out how many popsicles each part of the ratio represents, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

     \]

3. **Total cost of all streaming services:**
   - Adding the cost of Netflix to the cost of the bundle:
     \[
     10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Savings by cancelling the cable package:**
   - The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.
   - The total cost of the streaming services is $26 per month.
   - The savings is:
     \[

   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of cheese needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   - The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

5. **Calculate the total cost of meat and cheese:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns and cannolis in Allan's house.

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \).

Next, we account for the additional items Allan bought:

3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \( 40 + 60 = 100 \).
4. Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so the number of corns he bought is \( 100 - 40 = 60 \).

Now, we add the newly bought corns to the initial number of corns:

5. The new total number of corns is \( 80 + 60 = 140 \).

Finally, we find the combined total of corns and cannolis:

6. The combined total is \( 140 + 100 = 240 \).

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. After these activities, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal after his jog. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we can calculate the total steps taken before the jog and subtract this from the total steps minus the steps left after the jog:

Total steps before the jog = 5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps.
Total steps needed to reach the goal = 10,000 - 2,000 (steps left) = 8,000 steps.

Therefore, the steps taken during the jog = 8,000 (total needed to reach goal) - 6,000 (steps before the jog) = 2,000 steps.

"First, we calculate the total number of words in the book:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby needs to account for the 10 minutes it takes to get to the airport:
30 minutes (reading) + 10 minutes (travel) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Hours per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (assuming a typical month)

   Total payment for one employee in May:
   \[
   15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Total payment for all employees in May:
   \[
   2400 \text{ dollars/employee} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 96000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of employees in June:**
   - 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees}
   \]

   - Number of employees remaining in June:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30 \text{ employees}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Total payment for one employee in June:
   \[
   15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 2400 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means the first pound costs $3 and the second pound costs $1.50 (half of $3).

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells:
\[ 1.50 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the 4 magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, so:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog.

1. **Determine the number of candles that explode:**
   - Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles will explode.
   - If she makes 50,000 candles, the number of candles that will explode is:
     \[
     0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \text{ candles}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog:**
   - 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
   - Therefore, the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog is:
     \[
     0.05 \times 500 = 25 \text{ candles}
     \]

Thus, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
4. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
5. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
6. Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[
30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
150 + x = 500
\]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[
x = 350

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of camels.
2. Let \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of heads (camels and dromedaries) is 180.
- The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps each, dromedaries have 1 hump each) is 304.

We can write the following equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (total number of humps)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is:

"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the trip into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled over the first 4 days: 800 km.
   - 30% of 800 km: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).
   - Total distance for the next 2 days: 240 km.

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Tom wasn't traveling at all.
   - Total distance for this day: 0 km.

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next 1 day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Thus, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the elevation where the comb landed.

First, we know that Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet. The comb fell 4,000 feet from this elevation:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

So, the comb landed at an elevation of 6,000 feet.

Next, we know that Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's current elevation from the elevation where the comb landed:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - Let \( P_t \) be the original price of the tattered jeans.
   - Let \( P_j \) be the original price of the jogger jeans.
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28, so the savings from the tattered jeans is \( P_t - 28 = 4 \).
   - Therefore, \( P_t = 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22, so the savings from the jogger jeans is \( P_j - 22 = 2 \).
   - Therefore, \( P_j = 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokemon cards Kenny started with. Let's break down the information given:

1. Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket.
2. He also has $50 in spending cash after selling the cards.
3. He sells each card for $1.5.
4. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and sells the rest.

First, calculate the total amount of money Kenny has after selling the cards:
\[ \text{Total money} = \$100 + \$50 = \$150 \]

Next, determine how many cards he sold to make $150:
\[ \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{\$150}{\$1.5 \text{ per card}} = 100 \text{ cards} \]

Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, the number of cards he sold (100 cards) represents 2/3 of his total collection. Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \]

Solve for \( x \):

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, the caterer prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 1 hotdog for each of the remaining 18 guests.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (for second hotdogs) + 18 (for first hotdogs) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short = 80 (needed) - 54 (prepared) = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest wanted a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of hotdogs short.
   - Therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many gallons of gas are in one container.
2. Calculate how many gallons 1/4 of a container is.
3. Convert the gallons to pints (since there are 8 pints in a gallon).

Step 1: Determine the amount of gas in one container.
- 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers.
- Therefore, each container has \( \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \).

Step 2: Calculate how many gallons 1/4 of a container is.
- 1/4 of a container is \( \frac{3 \text{ gallons}}{4} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \).

Step 3: Convert the gallons to pints.
- There are 8 pints in a gallon.
- Therefore, 0.75 gallons is \( 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \).

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount George spent:**
   - George had $5 initially.
   - He had 1% of his money left, which means he had \( 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \) dollars left.
   - Therefore, the amount he spent is \( 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40.
   - The total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the amount spent on candy bars:**
   - The total amount spent is $4.95.
   - The amount spent on chips is $1.20.
   - The amount spent on candy bars is \( 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the number of candy bars:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75.

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to Marcus baking. Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the temperature increases by 5 degrees.

Temperature increase from baking = 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Initial temperature of the house = 40 degrees
Temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Next, Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes
Total cooling = (30 minutes / 10 minutes) * 2 degrees = 3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Temperature after opening the window = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it took James to complete the triathlon and then find out how long it took him to run.

First, let's calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Therefore, the time it takes James to swim is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time it takes James to run. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + x \]

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 180 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

Therefore, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets. Since there are 2 sheets, there are \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases. Since there are 4 pillow cases, there are \(4 \times 2 = 8\) towels.

Now, we sum the total number of items per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total items per room = \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\)

Next, we multiply the total number of items per room by the number of rooms:
Total items in 80 rooms = \(15 \times 80 = 1200\)

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have five cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the combined length of the remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents.

First, convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet:
- Each remora is 6 inches long.
- There are 12 inches in a foot, so 6 inches is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet.

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Next, calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:
- The shark is 10 feet long.
- The combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.

The percentage is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

1. **Number of kids allergic to dairy (A)**: 9
2. **Number of kids allergic to peanuts (B)**: 6
3. **Number of kids allergic to both (A ∩ B)**: 3

First, we calculate the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both (A ∪ B):

\[ A ∪ B = A + B - A ∩ B \]
\[ A ∪ B = 9 + 6 - 3 \]
\[ A ∪ B = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Next, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything:

\[ \text{Total kids} - \text{Kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both} \]
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is 20.

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = 10 \]

Next, substitute \( B = 2D \) and \( L = D + 7 \) into equation 1:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Thus, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then convert that to yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

So, together they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Next, we need to convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein to yards. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we calculate:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273
\]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem:

- Let \( C_O \) represent the number of chairs Ophelia has.
- Let \( S_O \) represent the number of sofas Ophelia has.
- Let \( C_J \) represent the number of chairs Jenna has.
- Let \( S_J \) represent the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3C_O \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).

First, we solve for \( C_O \) using the information that \( S_O = C_O - 2 \):
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we find \( C_J \) using the relationship \( C_J = 3C_O \):
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Now, we find \( S_J \) using the relationship \( S_J = C_J - 2 \):
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the variations in his routine.

1. **Regular Weekly Workouts**: Josh worked out for 4 hours each week. Over 8 weeks, this would normally be:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Increased Workouts**:
   - For two consecutive weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - For one week, he worked out for 6 hours:
     \[
     6 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Adjusting the Total**:
   - The total hours for the two weeks with 5 hours each and the one week with 6 hours is:
     \[
     10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - These 3 weeks are part of the 8 weeks, so we need to subtract the regular 4 hours for these 3 weeks from the initial total:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The adjusted total for these 3 weeks is:
     \[
     16 \text{ hours} - 12 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Adding the adjusted hours to the remaining 5 weeks of regular 4-hour workouts:
     \[
     32 \text{ hours} - 12 \text{ hours} + 16 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

2. On the first stop:
   - 8 passengers get off.
   - 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus.
   - Number of people getting on = 5 * 8 = 40.

   After the first stop:
   - People on the bus = 48 - 8 + 40 = 80.

3. On the second stop:
   - 21 passengers get off.
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on.
   - Number of people getting on = 21 / 3 = 7.

   After the second stop:
   - People on the bus = 80 - 21 + 7 = 66.

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the total cost of the printer and the monitors.

1. The cost of the computer is given as $1,100.
2. The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the cost of the printer is:
   \[
   1100 - 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   1100 + 2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} + 700 = 2400
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   1100 + 700 + 2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} = 2400
   \]
   \[
   1800 + 2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} = 2400
   \]
5. Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate the term with the cost of the monitors:
   \[
   2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} = 2400 - 1800
   \]
   \[
   2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} = 600
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for the cost of one monitor:
   \[
   \text{cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300
   \]

The cost of one monitor is \(300\) dollars.

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Set up the relationship between the savings in the first and second halves:**
   Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
   Then, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half of April.

4. **Calculate the total savings for each half:**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   The total savings for the month should equal his target of $1125.
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125
   \]

6. **Combine like terms and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45}
   \]
   \[
   x = 25

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:

"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $1.00 per tooth. Therefore, for three teeth, the total is:
   \[
   3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth each received $1.00, half of this amount is:
   \[
   \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per tooth}
   \]
   Therefore, for two teeth, the total is:
   \[
   2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
\boxed{9.00}

2. Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month.
3. Determine the difference between the total demand and the total supply.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month
Ford grows 40 roses every week. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

\[
40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 160 \text{ roses/month}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month
The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, the second orders 15 roses per week, and the third orders 30 roses per week.

\[
(20 + 15 + 30) \text{ roses/week} = 65 \text{ roses/week}
\]

Now, calculate the total number of roses ordered in a month:

\[
65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 260 \text{ roses/month}

2. **Calculate the protein content for 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - If 1 gram of mushrooms contains 0.03 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms contain \( 200 \text{ grams} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein/gram} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \).

3. **Determine the weekly protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.
   - Over a week (7 days), the total protein intake is \( 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams of protein} \).

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then figure out how much more he needs to earn.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant has a base price of $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Subtract the deposit George has already paid:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine how many hours George needs to work to earn the remaining amount:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - The number of hours he needs to work to earn $3900 is:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \). According to the problem, the other two angles are \( 2x \) and \( 3x \).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth 10 cents.
   - Colby has 6 dimes.
   - Total from dimes: \( 6 \times 10 = 60 \) cents.

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth 5 cents.
   - Colby has 14 nickels.
   - Total from nickels: \( 14 \times 5 = 70 \) cents.

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth 1 cent.
   - Colby has 15 pennies.
   - Total from pennies: \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) cents.

Next, we sum up all the amounts to find the total amount of money Colby has:
\[ 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents} \]

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
\[ \frac{345}{5} = 69 \]

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ 120 \, \text{pounds} / 2 \, \text{hours} = 60 \, \text{pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly production as follows:

\[ 120 \, \text{pounds} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \, \text{pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each person makes in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \, \text{pounds per hour} \times 12 \, \text{hours} = 720 \, \text{pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 90 \, \text{pounds per hour} \times 12 \, \text{hours} = 1080 \, \text{pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the combined total:

\[ 720 \, \text{pounds} + 1080 \, \text{pounds} = 1800 \, \text{pounds} \]

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, we calculate the speed in kb per hour:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
- Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second, so in one hour, she can download \(20 \times 3600 = 72000\) kb.

Next, we convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour:
- Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the total kb by 1000 to get the speed in Mb.
- \(72000 \div 1000 = 72\) Mb per hour.

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cars towed over the week, considering the different numbers of cars towed on different days.

1. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
   \]

2. For the remaining four days of the week, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars each day compared to the first three days. Therefore, the number of cars towed each day for the remaining four days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
   \]
   The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
   \[
   6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
   \]

3. Adding the totals from the first three days and the remaining four days gives us the total number of cars towed for the week:

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Determine the total cost of acquiring the cars.
3. Calculate the profit from selling the cars.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost of acquiring the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per Car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit from selling the cars.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission based on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, James made:
\[ 17,500 \]"

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. 

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, while Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. 

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap at this rate. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many fish Tommy caught, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Naomi's fish**: Naomi caught 17 fish.
2. **Darren's fish**: Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi. Therefore, we calculate Darren's fish as follows:
   \[
   \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11
   \]
3. **Tommy's fish**: Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Therefore, we calculate Tommy's fish as follows:
   \[
   \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14
   \]

Thus, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and see how many absences would push the cost per class over $10.

1. **Total cost of classes**: $60
2. **Total number of classes**: 10

The cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Total number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

This is below the $10 threshold, so Manny's parents will sign him up again if he attends all 10 classes.

Next, we need to determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10. Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. The number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class if Manny misses \( x \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the sales from green hats in the first month.
2. Calculate the total sales for the first month.
3. Calculate the total sales for the second month.
4. Sum the sales from both months to get the total amount made in two months.

**Step 1: Determine the sales from green hats in the first month.**

Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total sales for the first month.**

The total sales for the first month are the sum of the sales from red hats and green hats:
\[ \text{Total sales for the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total sales for the second month.**

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:
\[ \text{Total sales for the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

**Step 4: Sum the sales from both months to get the total amount made in two months.**

The total amount made in two months is the sum of the sales from the first month and the second month:
\[ \text{Total amount made in two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:
\[ \boxed{2100} \]"

2. Subtract the amount she should have received (her weekly wage) from the total amount she actually received to find out how much was withheld.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount received this week.
- Initial bank balance: $200
- Current bank balance: $420
- Total amount received: $420 - $200 = $220

Step 2: Determine how much was withheld from her wage.
- Weekly wage: $300
- Amount received: $220
- Amount withheld: $300 - $220 = $80

Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
   \[
   3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs required:**
   Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves.
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs}
   \]

3. **Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:**
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Thus, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

First, we calculate the total number of days required to read the book:
\[ \text{Total pages} = 200 \]
\[ \text{Pages per day} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Next, we determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish:
\[ \text{Deadline} = 30 \text{ days} \]
\[ \text{Days before deadline} = \text{Deadline} - \text{Total days required} = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days} \]

Thus, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel over 12 months.

1. **Initial cost of the plane:**
   \[
   \text{Initial cost} = \$150,000
   \]

2. **Monthly cost to rent a hanger:**
   \[
   \text{Hanger cost per month} = \$5,000
   \]

3. **Monthly cost for fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Fuel cost per month} = 2 \times \text{Hanger cost per month} = 2 \times \$5,000 = \$10,000
   \]

4. **Total monthly maintenance cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly cost} = \text{Hanger cost per month} + \text{Fuel cost per month} = \$5,000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000
   \]

5. **Total maintenance cost for the first year:**
   \[
   \text{Total maintenance cost for 12 months} = 12 \times \text{Total monthly cost} = 12 \times \$15,000 = \$180,000
   \]

6. **Total cost for the first year:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Initial cost} + \text{Total maintenance cost for 12 months} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cooking times for each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cooking time for rice**: Given as 30 minutes.
2. **Cooking time for pork**: It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Cooking time for beans**: Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, we calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, the cooking time for beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we sum the cooking times for all the food:
\[
30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Each animal has one head.
2. Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2 legs.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( S + G = 20 \)
2. The total number of legs: \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days in the Month**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of these days over the first 24 days:
- **First 8 Days**: All good.
- **Next 8 Days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 Days**: All neutral.

This accounts for the first 24 days. Now, we need to consider the next 6 days (since 30 - 24 = 6).

According to the problem, the next three days are:
- Good
- Neutral
- Good

So, the next three days add 2 more good days to the total.

Now, we need to determine how many good days are left in the month:
- Total good days in the first 30 days: 12
- Good days in the next three days: 2

Total good days in the month: \(12 + 2 = 14\)

Since the month has 30 days, and we are asked how many good days are left in the month, we need to consider the remaining days after the first 27 days (24 + 3 = 27).

The remaining days in the month are \(30 - 27 = 3\) days.

Since the problem does not specify the mood for these last three days, we assume they are not good days (as no information is given).

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:

\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

3. Calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the necessary amount.

First, convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches:
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- 20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

Next, determine the total growth needed to reach 600 inches:
- Total height needed = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Growth needed = 600 - 240 = 360 inches

Now, calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches:
- The bamboo grows 30 inches per day
- Number of days = 360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days

Therefore, the bamboo will reach 600 inches in 12 days.

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length of the dress before adding the lace trim is \( L + 0.5L = 1.5L \).

She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length of the dress \( 1.5L + 20 \) cm.

We know the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

Thus, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"First, we need to determine the cost of each candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost for the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost for 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost for 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved after ten years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of coins Rong saves per month:**
   Rong saves 20 coins every month.

2. **Calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month:**
   Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong. Therefore, the additional number of coins Neil saves per month is:
   \[
   20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 8 \text{ coins}
   \]
   So, Neil saves:
   \[
   20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of months in ten years:**
   There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
   \[
   10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of coins Rong saves in ten years:**
   Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 120 months, he saves:
   \[
   20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of coins Neil saves in ten years:**
   Neil saves 28 coins per month, so in 120 months, he saves:
   \[
   28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil:**
   Adding the total savings of Rong and Neil:
   \[
   2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins}
   \]

Thus, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

"First, let's determine the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Let \( T \) be the total bill. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill:
\[ \text{Heartworm check} = 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

"To determine the total number of squares on Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The number of red squares is given as 14.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24.

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

\[ \text{Daily cost from new vendor} = 500 \text{ tomatoes} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200 \]

**Step 3: Determine the daily savings.**

The daily savings is the difference between the daily cost from the old vendor and the daily cost from the new vendor.
\[ \text{Daily savings} = \$250 - \$200 = \$50 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the weekly savings.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings is:
\[ \text{Weekly savings} = \$50 \times 7 = \$350 \]

Therefore, the vendor saves \$350 a week.

"To determine the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end, we need to follow the steps of her trades and calculate the outcomes.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading 90% of small stickers for large buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons

3. **Remaining small stickers:**
   - 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers

4. **Trading 50% of large stickers for large buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons

5. **Remaining large stickers:**
   - 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers

6. **Trading the remaining large stickers for small buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons

7. **Total small buttons after all trades:**
   - Remaining small stickers: 3
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total small buttons = 3 + 60 = 63 small buttons

8. **Total large buttons:**
   - From trading small stickers: 9
   - From trading large stickers: 20
   - Total large buttons = 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons

9. **Total buttons:**
   - Total small buttons: 63

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:

\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is also 33. This can be expressed as:

\[ F + A = 33 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):

\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To find out how much each of the other two pizzas cost, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are not specified. 

The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars in total. 

First, subtract the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost:
64 dollars - 30 dollars = 34 dollars

This 34 dollars is the total cost of the other two pizzas. Since these two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide this amount by 2:
34 dollars ÷ 2 = 17 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the number of rides on the usual days and the number of rides on the special days.

1. **Usual Days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - This happens for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides per day = 2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day.
   - This happens for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought from the Store:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the store, which included both orange and white fish.

3. **Final Fish Count:**
   - After adding the 17 new fish, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought from the store.
- \( 17 - x \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought from the store.

4. **Total Fish Count After Purchase:**
   - Total white fish: \( 4 + x \)
   - Total orange fish: \( 3 + (17 - x) = 20 - x \)

5. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.
   - Therefore, \( 20 - x = 2(4 + x) \)

6. **Solve the Equation:**
   \[
   20 - x = 2(4 + x)
   \]
   \[
   20 - x = 8 + 2x
   \]
   \[
   20 - 8 = 2x + x
   \]
   \[
   12 = 3x
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish from the store.

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week. Since he charges $0.25 per branch and made $105 in total, we can calculate the total number of branches climbed as follows:

Total branches climbed = Total earnings / Charge per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420 branches

Next, to find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days in a week
Average branches per day = 420 branches / 7 days
Average branches per day = 60 branches

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of petals Rose picked initially and then subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped.

1. **Initial Petals:**
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

   Total initial petals: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

2. **Petals Dropped:**
   - 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals
   - 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals
   - 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals
   - 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals

   Total petals dropped: \(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

3. **Remaining Petals:**
   - Total initial petals: \(101\)
   - Total petals dropped: \(22\)

   Remaining petals: \(101 - 22 = 79\)

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used and lost:

- John makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
- They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

So, the total number of marshmallows used and lost is:
9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows.

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows. After using and losing 21, the number of marshmallows left is:
35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows.

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each kid can have:
14 / 2 = 7 S'mores.

"To determine how much money is used, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then convert that time into the number of quarters used.

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

2. **Two Friends (Worse Players):**
   - Each of these friends can play for 10 minutes per quarter (half of Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters each worse friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \).
   - Since there are two worse friends, total quarters used by both: \( 24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \).

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - This friend can play for 30 minutes per quarter (1.5 times Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters the better friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \).

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two worse friends: 48 quarters
   - One better friend: 8 quarters
   - Total quarters: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \).

5. **Total Money Used:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total money used: \( 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \).

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

We know the total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total volume as:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( s \) in the equation:
\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, substitute \( z = 1 \) back to find \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

Finally, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

Therefore, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add these amounts together.

1. Calculate the total cost of the goats:
   - John buys 3 goats.
   - Each goat costs $500.
   - Total cost for goats = 3 goats * $500/goat = $1500.

2. Calculate the total cost of the cows:
   - John buys 2 cows.
   - Each cow costs $1500.
   - Total cost for cows = 2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000.

3. Add the total costs of the goats and the cows to find the total amount spent:
   - Total amount spent = Total cost for goats + Total cost for cows = $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is $4500.

   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Calculate the total number of cars Joe no longer has:**
   - Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - Total cars no longer with Joe: \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.

5. **Determine the number of cars Joe remains with:**
   - Joe originally had 40 cars.
   - He no longer has 24 cars.
   - Therefore, Joe remains with \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) miles.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is \( 3 \times S \times 18 \) miles.
   - However, since they are traveling the same distance \( D \) together, we can say:
     \[
     D = 3 \times S \times 18
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54S
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{S}{2} \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is \( 4 \times \frac{S}{2} = 2S \) miles per hour.
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{2S}
     \]
   - Substituting \( D = 54S \) into the equation:
     \[
     T = \frac{54S}{2S} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to find the total number of slices:
15 slices from large apples + 15 slices from small apples = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 slices - 15 slices eaten = 15 slices

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces with 3 cows.
   - Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
   - Therefore, 3 cows produce \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) liters of milk a day.

2. Determine the additional amount of milk needed to reach 25 liters a day.
   - The farmer wants to produce 25 liters a day.
   - He currently produces 15 liters a day.
   - The additional amount needed is \( 25 - 15 = 10 \) liters a day.

3. Calculate how many more cows are needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk a day.
   - Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
   - To produce 10 more liters, the farmer needs \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \) more cows.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly has in her cart:

1. **Bacon**: 5 packs cost $10 in total, so each pack costs:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to break down the information given:

1. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
2. The final concert includes a 15-minute encore.
3. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

First, let's denote the length of her usual concert as \( x \) minutes.

The final concert, without the encore, is twice as long as her usual concert:
\[ 2x \]

Including the 15-minute encore, the total runtime of the final concert is:
\[ 2x + 15 \]

We know that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]
Subtract 15 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 50 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 25 \]

Thus, the length of Elaina's usual concerts is:
\[ 25 \]

"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends on various activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours a day.
3. **Walking his dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we add up the hours spent on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ (sleeping)} + 8 \text{ (working)} + 1 \text{ (walking the dog)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day, so the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"To determine how many red and blue shoe boxes are left in Tim's box, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of blue shoe boxes used for fishing.
2. Calculate the number of red shoe boxes used for fishing.
3. Subtract the used shoe boxes from the original number of shoe boxes to find the remaining shoe boxes.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of blue shoe boxes used for fishing.**
Tim uses 3 blue shoe boxes for fishing.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of red shoe boxes used for fishing.**
Tim uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes for fishing. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]
So, Tim uses 3 red shoe boxes for fishing.

**Step 3: Subtract the used shoe boxes from the original number of shoe boxes.**
- Original number of blue shoe boxes: 7
- Blue shoe boxes used: 3
- Blue shoe boxes left: \( 7 - 3 = 4 \)

- Original number of red shoe boxes: 9
- Red shoe boxes used: 3
- Red shoe boxes left: \( 9 - 3 = 6 \)

Therefore, the total number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Duncan's age eight years ago:**
   - Duncan's current age is 60.
   - Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).

2. **Express the relationship between Duncan's age eight years ago and Adam's age four years ago:**
   - According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago.
   - Let \( A \) be Adam's current age.
   - Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
   - Therefore, \( 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \).

3. **Solve for Adam's current age:**
   - \( 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \)
   - Divide both sides by 2: \( 26 = A - 4 \)
   - Add 4 to both sides: \( A = 30 \)

4. **Determine Adam's age in 8 years:**
   - Adam's current age is 30.
   - In 8 years, Adam's age will be \( 30 + 8 = 38 \).

Thus, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

3. Multiply the calories of a mini cinnamon roll by the number of mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Multiply the calories of a mini blueberry muffin by the number of mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

First, we calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Calories in a mini cinnamon roll = 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Next, we calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Calories in a mini blueberry muffin = 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we calculate the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls:
- Number of mini cinnamon rolls = 200.
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls = 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, we calculate the total calories for the mini blueberry muffins:
- Number of mini blueberry muffins = 300.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins = 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries:

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and John as \( P \), \( A \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( P + A + J = 100 \) (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old.)
2. \( A = J + 10 \) (Paul is 10 years older than John.)
3. \( P = A + J \) (Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.)

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( P \) from the second and third equations into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, find \( A \) and \( P \):
\[ A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Thus, Peter's age is:
\[ P = 50 \]

"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For the additional 5 hours, he will pay 70 pesos per hour.

First, calculate the cost for the additional hours:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

Now, add this to the initial 12-hour rate:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos. To find out how much Cameron saves, subtract the total he pays from the 24-hour rate:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Cameron saves 250 pesos.

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the amount of hay needed for the goats:
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = 75 pounds.

2. Calculate the amount of hay needed for the sheep:
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds.
   - Each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.

3. Calculate the total amount of hay needed:
   - Total hay = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

Thus, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay.

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
- John earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are \( 50 \times 6 = 300 \) dollars.

Next, we'll account for his expenses:
- He spends 50 dollars on gas.
- He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank.
- He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost for the pencils is \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \) dollars.

Now, let's calculate his remaining money after these expenses:
- Total expenses: \( 50 \) (gas) + \( 100 \) (bank deposit) + \( 50 \) (pencils) = \( 200 \) dollars.
- Remaining money: \( 300 - 200 = 100 \) dollars.

Finally, we need to determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:
- Each pen costs 25 dollars, so the number of pens he can buy is \( \frac{100}{25} = 4 \).

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"First, we need to determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know that he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has two dozen measuring cups, we convert this to a numerical value:

2 dozen = 24 measuring cups

Now, we calculate the number of measuring spoons:

\[
\text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

Next, Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. We subtract these from the total number of measuring spoons:

\[
16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons remaining}
\]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils remaining by adding the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups:

\[
24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils}

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokemon:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

We can substitute \( X \) and \( S \) in the first equation using the second and third equations.

First, substitute \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the third equation to find \( S \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13

Simplify:
\[
S = 160 - 13
\]
\[
S = 147
\]

Thus, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles south.

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles north.
   - Net distance after this leg = 300 miles south - 36 miles north = 264 miles south.

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles south.
   - Net distance after this leg = 264 miles south + 110 miles south = 374 miles south.

Thus, the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. According to the problem, Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Since Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Robert's cherries} = \text{Richard's cherries} + 10 \]
\[ 30 = \text{Richard's cherries} + 10 \]
\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = 30 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cherries Jerry has. The total number of cherries is 60, and we already know how many cherries Robert and Richard have:

\[ \text{Total cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} + \text{Richard's cherries} + \text{Jerry's cherries} \]
\[ 60 = 30 + 20 + \text{Jerry's cherries} \]
\[ 60 = 50 + \text{Jerry's cherries} \]
\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = 60 - 50 \]
\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = 10 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Robert's cherries} - \text{Jerry's cherries} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 30 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold each day and then multiply by the respective prices.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
- \( G_S = 10 \) (Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday)
- \( A_S = G_S - 4 \) (Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than gingerbread)
- \( G_U = G_S + 5 \) (Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday than on Saturday)
- \( A_U = 15 \) (Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday)

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes sold each day:
- \( A_S = 10 - 4 = 6 \) (boxes of apple pie on Saturday)
- \( G_U = 10 + 5 = 15 \) (boxes of gingerbread on Sunday)

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each day:
- Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \) dollars
- Earnings from apple pie on Saturday: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) dollars
- Total earnings on Saturday: \( 60 + 90 = 150 \) dollars

- Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday: \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) dollars
- Earnings from apple pie on Sunday: \( 15 \times 15 = 225 \) dollars
- Total earnings on Sunday: \( 90 + 225 = 315 \) dollars

Finally, we add the total earnings from both days:
- Total earnings for two days: \( 150 + 315 = 465 \) dollars

Thus, Sunny earned a total of 465 dollars over the two days.

4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: 3 years
- Alessandro: 4 years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

The total age of the children is:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total amount collected by Walter before his lawyer's donation. Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund, which sums up to:

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Then, Walter's friend donates an additional $200, so the total amount collected from everyone else is:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

\[ 3 \times 2200 = 6600 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the size of each slice of watermelon relative to the total watermelon and then calculate the percentage for each adult.

1. Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \).
2. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is:
- 4 kids' slices: \( 4x \)
- 2 adults' slices: \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \)

So, the total watermelon is divided into:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is calculated as:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 0.07 \times 3x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.79x = 28 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{28}{0.79} \approx 35.44\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 0.09 \times 5y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is 35.44%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.55y = 35.44 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{35.44}{0.55} \approx 64.44\%

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) because she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is:

"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first calculate the total number of sandwiches each family member eats per day and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

1. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
2. The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
3. The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

First, we add the daily consumption of all family members:
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Next, we multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week (7 days):
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.

"First, calculate the total earnings from the cookies and cupcakes. Suzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 each and 60 cupcakes at $4 each:

Earnings from cookies = 80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80
Earnings from cupcakes = 60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240

Total earnings = Earnings from cookies + Earnings from cupcakes
Total earnings = $80 + $240 = $320

Next, calculate the amount given to her sisters. She gave $10 to each of her two sisters:

Total given to sisters = 2 sisters * $10/sister = $20

Finally, calculate the amount of money Suzanne has left:

Money left = Total earnings - Total given to sisters
Money left = $320 - $20 = $300

"The Smith twins found a total of 30 eggs each, so together they found:
30 eggs + 30 eggs = 60 eggs

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 eggs were not found, so the number of eggs that were found is:
100 eggs - 10 eggs = 90 eggs

The number of eggs found by the friends is the total number of eggs found minus the number found by the Smith twins:
90 eggs - 60 eggs = 30 eggs

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then scale it up to 40 dwarves over 30 days.

1. **Determine the ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day:**
   - One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds per day.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in 30 days:**
   - In 30 days, 40 dwarves can mine \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds of ore.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the proportional relationship between the number of sandwiches and the cost. 

First, let's look at the given packages:
- 2 sandwiches for $3
- 4 sandwiches for $6

We can see that the cost per sandwich is consistent across these two packages:
- For the first package: $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich
- For the second package: $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package should also be $1.50. Therefore, the cost for 8 sandwiches is:
- 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, we calculate the number of yellow balloons that Sally released. She initially had 12 yellow balloons, and she released half of them:

\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons:

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

Now, we sum up all the balloons Sally carried into the school:

- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons:

\[ 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a substitute teacher is 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If the normal teacher is present, there are two further scenarios to consider:
     - **Extension for the whole class:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
       - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a class extension is 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20.
     - **Personal Extension:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60
       - If the normal teacher does not give an extension, there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
       - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
       - Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a personal extension is 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06.

3. **Total Probability of Not Turning in Homework:**
   - Sum of the probabilities of all scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
     - Substitute teacher: 0.50
     - Class extension: 0.20
     - Personal extension: 0.06
     - Total probability = 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76

4. **Probability of Turning in Homework:**
   - The probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is the complement of the total probability of not turning in his homework:
     - Probability = 1 - 0.76 = 0.24 or 24%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 24%.

"To determine how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family.
2. Divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates.

First, we calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family:
- Total seats in the Fine Arts Center: 6000
- Seats for graduates: 950
- Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats for friends and family = Total seats - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
Total seats for friends and family = 6000 - 950 - 300
Total seats for friends and family = 4750

Next, we divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates:
- Number of graduates: 950

Tickets per graduate = Total seats for friends and family / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets.

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles.

2. **Determine the time to move between bottles:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

3. **Calculate the total time to move between all bottles:**
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = 7 pairs * 5 seconds per pair = 35 seconds.

4. **Add the time to drop the candy in the first bottle:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he needs to drop the candy in the first bottle before moving to the next.
   - Time to drop the candy in the first bottle = 0 seconds (since he starts there).

5. **Calculate the total time:**

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn and then determine how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new income.

1. **Calculate the total amount of loans:**
   - Jim takes 4 years to finish college.
   - He gets $50,000 in loans per year.
   - Total loans = 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working:**
   - Jim had a $25,000 a year job before college.
   - He did not work for 4 years.
   - Total income lost = 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn:**

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Jim needs pieces that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

The length of each fabric piece:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

The width of each fabric piece:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area required is:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

\[ 325 \text{ kilometers/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 1300 \text{ kilometers} \]

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is 1955 kilometers. To find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:
\[ 1955 \text{ kilometers} - 1300 \text{ kilometers} = 655 \text{ kilometers} \]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

4. **Verify the total number of slices available:**
   - Each pizza had 8 slices.
   - There were 4 pizzas.
   - Total slices available = \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Since the total slices eaten (31) is less than the total slices available (32), the calculation is consistent.

The total number of slices they ate is:

"Let's denote the time Donovan took to complete his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's time can be expressed as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal together is the sum of the times taken by Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs of each component:

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The visit lasts 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The doctor charges $300 per hour, so the cost for the visit is:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours} \times 300 \text{ dollars/hour} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: Hannah receives 30 painkillers, and each pill costs $4, so the total cost for the painkillers is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pills} \times 4 \text{ dollars/pill} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The mandatory minimum parking time is 2 hours, and the parking rate is $6 per hour, so the total cost for parking is:

"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out.
2. Calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons.
3. Calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons.
4. Add the costs together to find the total amount spent on postage.

Step 1: Calculate the number of big coupons.
Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons:
\[ \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Step 2: Calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons.
Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail:
\[ \text{Cost of small coupons} = 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons.
Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail:
\[ \text{Cost of big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Step 4: Add the costs together to find the total amount spent on postage.

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week.
2. Determine the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys.
3. Subtract the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find the daily consumption of the third monkey.

First, we know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315 bananas.

Next, we calculate the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Now, we find the total daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day.
- The second monkey eats 14 bananas per day.
- Together, they eat \(10 + 14 = 24\) bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315, we can find the total daily consumption of all three monkeys:
- Total daily consumption = \( \frac{315 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \).

Finally, we subtract the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find the daily consumption of the third monkey:
- Daily consumption of the third monkey = \(45 - 24 = 21\) bananas per day.

Thus, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved.

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach 200 toothpicks:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can calculate the number of additional weeks required to save 80 more toothpicks:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

1. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, there are \( 60 \times 60 = 3600 \) seconds in one hour.
   - For 4 hours, the total number of seconds is \( 3600 \times 4 = 14400 \) seconds.

2. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates one jellyfish every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create \( 14400 \) jellyfish.

3. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \( 14400 \times 5 = 72000 \) jellyfish.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72000.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance James walked and then determine the time it took based on his walking speed.

1. **Distance to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Halfway to the store**: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
3. **Distance walked to halfway point and back home**: 2 miles (to halfway) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.
4. **Distance from home to the store after returning home**: 4 miles.

So, the total distance James walked is:
4 miles (to halfway and back) + 4 miles (to the store) = 8 miles.

5. **Walking speed**: 4 miles per hour.

To find the total time taken, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, the total amount of fence is 100 feet:
\[ S + H = 100 \]

It is also given that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam:
\[ H = S + 60 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S = 100 - 60 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left.

2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. Therefore, the 270 kilograms of meat that the Allosaurus ate is half of what was left after the T-Rex. This means that before the velociraptors ate, there were:
   \[
   270 \times 2 = 540 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. Therefore, the 540 kilograms of meat that was left after the T-Rex is half of the total meat on the triceratops. This means that before the T-Rex ate, there were:
   \[
   540 \times 2 = 1080 \text{ kilograms}

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of picking a shaken can from the remaining sodas.

Initially, Ellen had a case of 12 sodas, of which 3 were shaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas (3 shaken and 8 unshaken).

Ellen's brother then took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving:
- Shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2
- Unshaken sodas: 8 - 2 = 6

So, there are now 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left, making a total of 8 sodas.

The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days in June:**
   June has 30 days.

2. **Calculate the total miles Soledad plans to hike each day:**
   Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which totals:
   \[
   125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total miles Soledad will hike in June with her current plan:**
   \[
   250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Determine the additional miles needed to reach her goal:**
   Soledad's goal is 9,300 miles. The additional miles needed are:
   \[
   9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the additional miles per day required:**
   To find out how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:
   \[
   \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her 9,300-mile journey on time.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the remaining half of the stickers to Kris, so Kris received \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total.
6. Since Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16
   \]
7. Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 16 \times 4 = 64

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T_2 \)-degree water.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixture is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell orders 4 packs.
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Step 2: Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the total cost.
\[ 90\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.90 \times \$40.00 = \$36.00 \]

Step 3: Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.
Each pack contains 9 bagels, and Russell orders 4 packs.
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

Therefore, the cost per bagel after the discount is:

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes:
\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]
So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to determine how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's break this down:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
So, it takes 3 potatoes to make:
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]
2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, so we can set up a proportion:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes during each period and then sum these amounts.

1. For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs per day:
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day:
   \[
   5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
   \]

   - Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - First, we need to find the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree.

5. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 20 \times 50 = 1000 \) fruits.

6. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) fruits.

7. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

8. **Summing up the fruits produced each year:**
   - Year 1: 0 fruits (not specified, assume 0)
   - Year 2: 0 fruits (not specified, assume 0)
   - Year 3: 0 fruits (not specified, assume 0)
   - Year 4: 0 fruits (not specified, assume 0)

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \), the length of the red rope as \( R \), and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R \) from the first equation into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Next, substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, substitute \( Y = 12 \) back into the second equation to find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ B = 12 - 7 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Finally, substitute \( B = 5 \) into the first equation to find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B \]
\[ R = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Amount Left in Ronnie's Money:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to their little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount left in Ronnie's money is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

The final amount left in Ronnie's money is:
\[

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. The mural is composed of four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. The amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal.
3. Half of the mural is yellow.
4. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

First, let's determine the amount of yellow paint used. Since half the mural is yellow:
\[ \text{Amount of yellow paint} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Next, we need to find out how much paint is used for the remaining colors (red, white, and purple). Since the total amount of paint is 12 pints and 6 pints are used for yellow:
\[ \text{Total amount of red, white, and purple paint} = 12 \text{ pints} - 6 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide the remaining 6 pints equally among the three colors:
\[ \text{Amount of red paint} = \frac{6 \text{ pints}}{3} = 2 \text{ pints} \]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dishwasher pods are in the special size box and then calculate how many cycles can be run for $1.

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Calculate how many pods can be bought for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods that can be bought for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1:**
   - Since 1 pod is used per cycle, the number of cycles that can be run for $1 is 10.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 is:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing 10 Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the remaining money.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   Thomas converts the $1200 to $5 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Therefore, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Therefore, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, expand the first equation:
\[
W = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

First, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that 100 books cost $500. Therefore, the cost per book is:
\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we determine how many books Bob can buy with $27000:
\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is distributing the books equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:
\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices of each type of pizza her friends will consume and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:
- Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- There are 6 friends.

Total cheese pizza slices consumed:
\[ 6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese pizzas are required. Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:
- Each friend eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- There are 6 friends.

Total pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
\[ 4 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole pepperoni pizzas are required. Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Thus, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he makes the snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of making snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in 1 hour.
   - Therefore, in 15 minutes (which is 1/4 of an hour), he can make \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.

2. **Rate of melting snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.

3. **Net rate of snowball accumulation:**
   - In 15 minutes, Jay makes 5 snowballs and 2 melt, so the net increase in snowballs is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs every 15 minutes.

4. **Time to reach 60 snowballs:**
   - To find out how many 15-minute intervals are needed to reach 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by the net increase per 15 minutes:
     \[
     \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ intervals}
     \]
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is:
     \[
     20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ minutes}

   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.

3. **Calculate John's age 20 years ago:**
   - John's age 20 years ago: \( 28 - 20 = 8 \) years old.

4. **Set up the relationship between John's and Jim's ages 20 years ago:**
   - According to the problem, 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - Let \( J \) be Jim's age 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 8 = 2J \).

5. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - \( J = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

6. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - Jim's current age: \( 4 + 20 = 24 \) years old.

"To determine how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to track the usage and orders over the three days and then work backwards to find the initial amount.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used 38 bandages.
   - Ordered 1 bulk pack (50 bandages).

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used 10 fewer bandages than the first day: \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Ordered 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages).
   - Used half a pack: \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.

4. **End of the Third Day:**
   - They had 78 bandages left.

Let's calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days:

- **Total bandages used:**
  - First day: 38
  - Second day: 28
  - Third day: 25
  - Total used: \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\) bandages.

- **Total bandages ordered:**
  - First day: 50
  - Third day: 100
  - Total ordered: \(50 + 100 = 150\) bandages.

Now, let's determine the initial number of bandages. We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + \text{Total ordered} - \text{Total used} = \text{Bandages left} \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + 150 - 91 = 78 \]

Solve for the initial bandages:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + 59 = 78 \]
\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 78 - 59 \]
\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 19 \]

Thus, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To determine the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately, and then add them together.

1. **Cost of the color:**
   The cost for the color is a fixed amount of $40.

2. **Cost of the haircut:**
   The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch of hair cut off. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the length of hair cut off is:
   \[
   10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches}
   \]
   The cost for the haircut is:
   \[
   2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars per inch} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total cost:**
   The total cost is the sum of the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut:
   \[
   40 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of May's cut and color is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and calculate the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.

1. **Mattison's height**: 60 inches.
2. **Height of the house**: 7 times Mattison's height.
   \[
   \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Height of the first floor ceiling**: 3 times Mattison's height.
   \[
   \text{Height of the first floor ceiling} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches}

The height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors. We already know the height of the first floor ceiling, which is the height from the ground to the first floor ceiling. To find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, we subtract the height of the first floor ceiling from the total height of the house.

\[
\text{Height from the second floor's floor to the roof} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor ceiling}
\]
\[
\text{Height from the second floor's floor to the roof} = 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches}

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Calculate the cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total number of visits in 5 years: \(3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ years} = 15 \text{ visits}\).
   - Total cost for 5 years: \(15 \text{ visits} \times \$2/\text{visit} = \$30\).

2. **Calculate the new cost of one visit after the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 is \(1.5 \times \$2 = \$3\).
   - New cost of one visit: \(\$2 + \$3 = \$5\).

3. **Calculate the cost of visits after the price increase:**
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total number of visits in 3 years: \(3 \text{ visits/year} \times 3 \text{ years} = 9 \text{ visits}\).
   - Total cost for 3 years: \(9 \text{ visits} \times \$5/\text{visit} = \$45\).

4. **Calculate the total cost for all visits:**
   - Total cost for the first 5 years: \$30.
   - Total cost for the next 3 years: \$45.
   - Total cost for all visits: \(\$30 + \$45 = \$75\).

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is \(\boxed{75}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles that Brianna's family has.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - Each of the 4 people has a flashlight.
   - There are 2 flashlights in each of the 8 rooms.
   - Total flashlights = Flashlights for people + Flashlights for rooms
   - Total flashlights = 4 (for people) + 2 * 8 (for rooms)
   - Total flashlights = 4 + 16 = 20

2. **Candles:**
   - There are 4 small candles in each of half the rooms.
   - There are 5 medium candles in each of the other half of the rooms.
   - Half of the 8 rooms is 4 rooms.
   - Total small candles = 4 small candles/room * 4 rooms
   - Total small candles = 16
   - Total medium candles = 5 medium candles/room * 4 rooms
   - Total medium candles = 20
   - Total candles = Total small candles + Total medium candles
   - Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36

"To determine how long it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to travel both the land and water portions of his journey.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: Half of 200 yards = 100 yards
3. **Distance in Water**: Half of 200 yards = 100 yards

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each part of the journey:

- **Time on Land**: 
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time in Water**: 
  \[
  \text{Time in Water} = \frac{\text{Distance in Water}}{\text{Speed in Water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times together to get the total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Land} + \text{Time in Water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

- Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.
- Speed = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.

Since Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed:
- Vanessa's speed = 0.125 miles per minute / 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute.

Next, we calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:
- Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute = 64 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.

1. Calculate the total line needed:
   \[
   3 \text{ feet of line/foot of dock} \times 200 \text{ feet of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line}
   \]

2. Subtract the line he already has:
   \[
   600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line}
   \]

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost per reservation:**
   - Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each and 1 bottle of wine at $5.
   - Total cost per reservation = (2 meals * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15.

2. **Calculate the total revenue per night:**
   - The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.
   - Total revenue per night = 6 reservations * $15 per reservation = $90.

3. **Calculate the total revenue per week:**
   - The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
   - Total revenue per week = 2 nights * $90 per night = $180.

Thus, the total amount the restaurant makes in a week is:

"To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the watermelons:**
   The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. **Calculate the total profit:**
   The profit is 25% of the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the total selling price:**
   The total selling price is the total cost plus the total profit.
   \[
   \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

4. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon:**
   The total selling price is divided by the number of watermelons.
   \[
   \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2
   \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - James is currently 18 years old.
   - Therefore, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - John is currently 37 years old.
   - Therefore, John's youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - John's youngest son is currently 5 years old.
   - In 3 years, he will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final answer is:

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in 60 minutes and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in 60 minutes:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in 60 minutes is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in 60 minutes:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in 60 minutes is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Determine the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - The difference is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original price is $400, and he gets it for 80% off:

\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

This is the discount amount. So, the price he pays for the radiator is:

\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor to find the total amount Mark paid:

\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( K \) represent the number of cows.

We know the following:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To determine how many slices of pizza each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 7 pizzas is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes 4 people in total:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.
