"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. This means she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs each day. 

The number of eggs left for selling is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. 

She sells each egg for $2, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To figure out the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber.

- The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- It takes half that much white fiber, which is half of 2 bolts, so it takes 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber together:

2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

So, the total number of bolts needed is:

"To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

150% of the original value ($80,000) is:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ 70,000 \]

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed Wendi gives her chickens each day.
2. Determine how much feed has already been given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement to find out how much is needed for the final meal.

First, let's calculate the total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens:
- Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, let's determine how much feed has already been given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Finally, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement to find out how much is needed for the final meal:
- Total daily requirement: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses considering the discount on every second glass.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is $3.
3. This pattern repeats for every pair of glasses.

So, for every pair of glasses, the total cost is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost for 8 pairs of glasses:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ 64 \]

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles in this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance covered = 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance covered = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially drove 180 miles away from home.
   - He covered 135 miles on his return trip.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To find out how much Eliza earned this week, we need to calculate her earnings for both the regular hours and the overtime hours.

1. Calculate the earnings for the first 40 hours:
   - Regular rate per hour = $10
   - Hours worked at regular rate = 40
   - Earnings for regular hours = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. Calculate the earnings for the 5 hours of overtime:
   - Overtime rate per hour = 1.2 times the regular rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12
   - Hours worked at overtime rate = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
   - Earnings for overtime hours = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. Add the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours to get the total earnings:
   - Total earnings = Earnings for regular hours + Earnings for overtime hours
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

1. **Cost of donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Cost of mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Cost of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add the costs of all the pastries together:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

So, the total cost is $694.

"To figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and see when it covers the initial planting cost.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Revenue from Lemons**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost for Watering and Feeding**: $3
4. **Net Annual Profit**: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net annual profit to cover the initial cost of $90.

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Net Annual Profit}} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
3. After selling at the green house, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.
6. After selling at the orange house, she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left, which is given as 5.

So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]
\[ 2x = 36 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

   - She teaches for 35 hours a week.
   - She gets paid $20 per hour.
   - Her weekly earnings from teaching are \( 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 700 \text{ dollars/week} \).
   - She works 50 weeks a year, so her annual earnings from teaching are \( 700 \text{ dollars/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 35,000 \text{ dollars/year} \).

2. Calculate her earnings from cheerleading coaching:
   - She coaches for 15 hours a week.
   - She gets paid $30 per hour.
   - Her weekly earnings from coaching are \( 15 \text{ hours/week} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 450 \text{ dollars/week} \).
   - She works 50 weeks a year, so her annual earnings from coaching are \( 450 \text{ dollars/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 22,500 \text{ dollars/year} \).

3. Add her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:

"To find out the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has to complete the 12-mile trail to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

1. **Total distance of the trail:** 12 miles
2. **Desired average speed:** 4 miles per hour

To find the total time required to achieve this average speed:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- First 4 miles: 1 hour
- Next 2 miles: 1 hour
- Total time so far: 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Marissa has 3 hours in total to complete the trail, and she has already spent 2 hours. Therefore, she has:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Now, we need to find out the remaining distance she has to walk:
\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in the remaining 1 hour:
\[ \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of:
\[ 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we need to account for the spill. Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is:

\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water in remaining orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Now, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

When we mix the remaining 9 liters of orange drink with the 15 liters of pineapple drink, the total volume of the mixture is:

\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink:

\[ \text{Total water} = 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the pizza.

1. The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
3. The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
$12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50. To find out how much she spent on pizza, we subtract the total cost of the other items from $50:
$50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the guesses made by Gunter's friends.
2. Calculate the average of these guesses.

First, let's list the guesses:
- The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
- The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess.

Now, let's calculate the second friend's guess:
- Half of the first friend's guess: \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \)
- 20 more than half: \( 40 + 20 = 60 \)

Next, let's calculate the third friend's guess:
- 25% more than the first friend's guess: \( 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 \)

Now, we have the three guesses:
- First friend: 80
- Second friend: 60
- Third friend: 100

To find the average, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

So, the average guess is:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

Now, substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Next, solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 40 \) back into the equation \( G = S + 30 \):
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours based on the given time distribution.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total calories in the bag:**
   - The bag has 5 servings.
   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

2. **Determine the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Each serving is 250 calories.
   - Each serving is 300g / 5 servings = 60g.
   - To find out how many grams 200 calories is, we use the ratio:
     \[
     \text{Grams per calorie} = \frac{60 \text{ grams}}{250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie}
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of grams you can eat with 200 calories is:
     \[
     200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams}
     \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"First, let's figure out how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + (50% of Cost per blue tie)
Cost per red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes by multiplying the total number of students by the amount she charges per student.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week:
- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), she teaches 5 classes each day.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

Total classes on weekdays:
5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes

Total classes on Saturday:
8 classes

Total classes in a week:
25 classes + 8 classes = 33 classes

Next, let's calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:
- Each class has 15 students.

Total students in a week:
33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money she makes:
- She charges $15.00 per student.

Total money made in a week:
495 students * $15.00/student = $7,425.00

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for all the cell phones.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid.
4. Divide the total amount by the number of months (3) to find the monthly payment.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Total cost of the cell phones without interest:**
   - Shiela bought 5 cell phones.
   - Each cell phone costs $150.
   - Total cost = 5 * $150 = $750.

2. **Total interest for all the cell phones:**
   - The interest rate is 2%.
   - Total interest = 2% of $750.
   - Total interest = 0.02 * $750 = $15.

3. **Total amount to be paid:**
   - Total amount = Total cost + Total interest.
   - Total amount = $750 + $15 = $765.

4. **Monthly payment:**
   - Number of months = 3.
   - Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months.
   - Monthly payment = $765 / 3 = $255.

So, Shiela will pay each month for 3 months:

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-leveled sandcastle, we need to determine the square footage of each level and then calculate the average.

1. The top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16.
2. The level below it (Level 3) will have twice the square footage of Level 4, so:
   \[
   \text{Square footage of Level 3} = 16 \times 2 = 32
   \]
3. The level below that (Level 2) will have twice the square footage of Level 3, so:
   \[
   \text{Square footage of Level 2} = 32 \times 2 = 64
   \]
4. The bottom level (Level 1) will have twice the square footage of Level 2, so:
   \[
   \text{Square footage of Level 1} = 64 \times 2 = 128
   \]

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[
16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240
\]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[
\text{Average square footage} = \frac{240}{4} = 60

"First, we need to determine how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Solving for David's laundry:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

"To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying the flowers in packages of 3 and in packages of 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 3 = 6 packages.
- The total cost for 6 packages is 6 * $2.50 = $15.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.00.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 2 = 9 packages.
- The total cost for 9 packages is 9 * $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- The cost for packages of 3 is $15.00.
- The cost for packages of 2 is $9.00.

The amount of money Vincent saves by buying the flowers in packages of 2 is:
$15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.

So, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won and \( L \) represent the number of games lost. According to the problem:

1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can write these as:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substitute \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Sylvie's monthly salary after 5 years.
2. Calculate the monthly salary after each of the next three years.
3. Convert the final monthly salary to an annual salary.

**Step 1: Determine Sylvie's monthly salary after 5 years.**

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. After 5 years, her salary increases by 10% of the initial salary.

\[ \text{Increase} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
\[ \text{New monthly salary} = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the monthly salary after each of the next three years.**

Since the salary does not increase further after the initial 10% raise, her monthly salary remains $660 for the next three years.

**Step 3: Convert the final monthly salary to an annual salary.**

\[ \text{Annual salary} = 660 \times 12 = 7920 \]

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is:

\[ 7920 \]"

"To find out how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that both the adult and child dinosaurs will eat.

1. First, calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
   - Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
   - Total potato salad for adults = 10 lbs/adult * 20 adults = 200 lbs.

2. Next, calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
   - Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 5 child dinosaurs.
   - Total potato salad for children = 5 lbs/child * 5 children = 25 lbs.

3. Finally, add the total amounts for adults and children to get the total amount of potato salad needed:
   - Total potato salad = 200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs.

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

2. Calculate Gerald's improved time after his diet change.

First, we know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and that he used to be two seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, Gerald's original time can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's time} + 2 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find Gerald's improved time after his diet change, which improved his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement in speed means he can run 10% faster, which translates to a 10% reduction in his time.

To find the new time, we calculate 10% of Gerald's original time and subtract it from his original time:

\[ \text{10% of Gerald's original time} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Gerald's improved time} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first determine the inner dimensions of one box and then calculate the volume.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume of one box = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
   - Inner volume of one box = \( 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × Number of boxes
   - Total inner volume = \( 24 \times 3 = 72 \) cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"Let's break down the total TV watching time by each day:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \( x \) (30-minute episodes)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hour = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up the equation:

\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Combine the constants:

\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[ x = 3 \]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we need to calculate the total area of the roll-ups each of them had and then find the average of these areas.

1. Calculate the area of Beatrice's roll-up:
   - Width: 2 roll-ups
   - Length: 24 roll-ups
   - Area = Width × Length = 2 × 24 = 48 roll-ups

2. Calculate the area of Marcell's roll-up:
   - Width: 3 roll-ups
   - Length: 14 roll-ups
   - Area = Width × Length = 3 × 14 = 42 roll-ups

3. Find the total area of both roll-ups:
   - Total area = Area of Beatrice's roll-up + Area of Marcell's roll-up = 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups

4. Calculate the average area:

"To find out how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total distance Julia rowed.
2. Calculate the total time it took her to row that distance.
3. Use the rate of water intake to find out how much water the boat took on.

First, we know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, so we need to find out how far she rowed in 64 seconds.

\[
\text{Distance rowed} = \left(\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds}
\]

\[
\text{Distance rowed} = \left(\frac{20}{16}\right) \times 64
\]

\[
\text{Distance rowed} = 1.25 \times 64
\]

\[
\text{Distance rowed} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We need to find out how much water the boat took on over 80 feet.

\[
\text{Water intake} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet}
\]

\[
\text{Water intake} = 0.2 \times 80
\]

\[
\text{Water intake} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

So, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Each board cost $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Each board cost $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

Total cost for all the lumber:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber after the 50% price increase.

For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Original price per board = $10.
- New price per board = $10 + 50% of $10 = $10 + $5 = $15.
- Total selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150.

For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Original price per board = $16.
- New price per board = $16 + 50% of $16 = $16 + $8 = $24.
- Total selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $24/board = $120.

Total selling price for all the lumber:
- Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of both.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the ratio are:

\[ 7 + 13 = 20 \]

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. We need to find out how many of these 120 parts are teaspoons of sugar.

Since the total parts in the ratio are 20, each part is:

\[ \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Now, to find the number of teaspoons of sugar, we multiply the number of parts of sugar by the value of each part:

\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

So, the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used is:

   \]

2. The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
   \[
   30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

3. Each container contains 5 vehicles, so the number of containers imported on the second day is:

"First, let's determine Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can write:

\[ 40000 = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Solving for Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we calculate Lylah's salary four years later. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples John has in his field.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest in a year.
3. Multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests in a year.

Step 1: Total number of pineapples in the field
- John has 10 hectares.
- Each hectare has 100 pineapples.
- Total pineapples = 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples.

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
- John can harvest every 3 months.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Number of harvests = 12 months / 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests.

Step 3: Total pineapples harvested in a year
- Total pineapples per harvest = 1000 pineapples.
- Number of harvests = 4.
- Total pineapples harvested in a year = 1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference in their travel times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- 1 mile = 5280 feet

Steve's distance:
- 3 miles = 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet

Tim's distance:
- 2 miles = 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time:
- Speed = 440 feet per minute
- Time = Distance / Speed = 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes

Tim's time:
- Speed = 264 feet per minute
- Time = Distance / Speed = 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

Now, we find the difference in their travel times:
- Difference = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The winner will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came by with bicycles, so the total number of bicycle tires is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).
   - Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total cost for the bicycle tires is \(10 \times 0.25 = 2.50\) dollars.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came by with tricycles, so the total number of tricycle tires is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
   - Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total cost for the tricycle tires is \(9 \times 0.25 = 2.25\) dollars.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came by with a unicycle, so the total number of unicycle tires is \(1 \times 1 = 1\).
   - Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total cost for the unicycle tire is \(1 \times 0.25 = 0.25\) dollars.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost for bicycle tires: \(2.50\) dollars
- Total cost for tricycle tires: \(2.25\) dollars
- Total cost for unicycle tire: \(0.25\) dollars

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. **Dave ate 14 fries.**
2. **The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate:**
   \[
   \text{Seagull ate} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ fries}
   \]

3. **Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:**
   \[
   \text{Pigeons ate} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]

4. **Total fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons:**
   \[
   14 + 7 + 9 = 30 \text{ fries}
   \]

5. **Let \( x \) be the total number of fries in the pack initially. After the seagull and pigeons ate, the remaining fries are:**
   \[
   x - 30
   \]

6. **A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:**
   \[
   \text{Raccoon ate} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30)
   \]

7. **The remaining fries after the raccoon ate:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30)
   \]

8. **Ants carried off one more fry, leaving 5 fries behind:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5

9. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
   \]
   \[
   x - 30 = 18

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in class each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on each type of day:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each 1 hour long. So, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total for these days is:
  \[
  3 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long. So, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total for these days is:
  \[
  2 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Now, let's add the total hours for all the days in a week:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Next, we multiply the total weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
272

"To find out how much a bag of marbles would cost after 36 months with a 20% increase every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of price increases:** Since the price increases every two months, we need to find out how many two-month periods are in 36 months.
   \[
   \text{Number of increases} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
   \]

2. **Calculate the new price after each increase:** Each increase is 20% of the original price, so the price multiplier for each increase is 1.20 (100% + 20% = 120% = 1.20).

3. **Apply the price increase 18 times:** The formula to calculate the final price after multiple increases is:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1.20)^{\text{Number of increases}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

4. **Calculate the final price:**

In 2 years:
- Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \).
- Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \).

According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28:

3. Calculate the total revenue \( R \):
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is \( 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \) dollars.
   - The total revenue \( R \) is \( 10G \).

4. Set up the equation for profit:
   - Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
   - \( 25 = 10G - 5G \)
   - \( 25 = 5G \)
   - \( G = 5 \) gallons

5. Calculate the cost of lemons:
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - For 5 gallons, the cost of lemons is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

So, the amount spent on lemons is:

   \]

2. **Car Fuel**: Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total spent on rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Expenses for daughter and wife**:
   - Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars.
   - Zaid gives his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total expenses for daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

8. **Final remaining amount**:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of red roses Sandra ordered and how many are missing. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of white carnations:**
   - Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of white carnations.
   - Therefore, \( 5C = 200 \).
   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{200}{5} = 40
     \]

2. **Determine the number of red roses:**
   - Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of red roses.
   - Therefore, \( R = 4C \).
   - Substituting the value of \( C \):
     \[
     R = 4 \times 40 = 160

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the ages:**
   - Jan's age is given as 30.
   - Let Mark's current age be \( M \).
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is \( M + 2 \).

2. **Two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago is \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
   - So, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

4. **Solve for \( M \):**
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 19 + 2 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

5. **Find Jean's age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is \( 21 + 2 = 23 \).

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - The difference in probabilities is \( 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \).

4. **Expressing the difference as a percentage:**
   - To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we calculate the percentage increase:
   - \( \frac{0.25}{0.25} \times 100\% = 100\% \).

So, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.

2. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats:**
   - Total straw distributed = 160 pieces.
   - Straw for hamsters = 50 pieces.
   - Straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.
   - Straw for rats = 160 pieces - 50 pieces - 20 pieces = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total number of rats = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Number of rats in each cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage.

The number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest of 2%, we can calculate the total amount including interest.

1. **Initial amount (Principal):** $100
2. **Monthly interest rate:** 2% or 0.02
3. **Number of months:** 3

The formula to calculate the total amount after interest is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Number of Months}} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 100 \times (1 + 0.02)^3 \]

First, calculate \(1 + 0.02\):
\[ 1 + 0.02 = 1.02 \]

Next, raise 1.02 to the power of 3:
\[ 1.02^3 \approx 1.061208 \]

Now, multiply the principal by this factor:
\[ 100 \times 1.061208 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent:
\[ 106.12 \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net change in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}

"To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score among the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93 with the lowest score removed.
3. Determine the score required on the sixth test to reach this total.

First, let's list Brinley's scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86.

The lowest score is 71.

Next, we need to find the total score required for an average of 93 over the remaining five tests (after removing the lowest score).

The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Score}}{\text{Number of Tests}} \]

We want the average to be 93 over 5 tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Total Score}}{5} \]

So, the total score needed is:
\[ \text{Total Score} = 93 \times 5 = 465 \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the remaining four scores after removing the lowest score (71):
\[ 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367 \]

Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The total score including the sixth test should be:
\[ 367 + x = 465 \]

   - Total weight of the chocolate bars = 25 chocolate bars * 40g per chocolate bar = 1000g.

2. **Weight of the candied apples:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
   - Therefore, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Total weight of the candied apples = 80 candied apples * 20g per candied apple = 1600g.

3. **Total weight of the bag:**
   - Total weight = weight of the chocolate bars + weight of the candied apples = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

So, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates means 6 plates.
   - Total cost of 6 plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Calculate the cost of one cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups means 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Total cost of 240 cups = $34800.
   - Cost of one cup = $34800 / 240 = $145.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
2. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is \( r + 2 \).

3. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs from the red chickens is \( 3r \).

4. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs from the white chickens is \( 5(r + 2) \).

5. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
   \]

6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5r + 10 = 42
   \]
   \[
   8r + 10 = 42
   \]

7. Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   8r = 32
   \]

8. Divide both sides by 8:
   \[
   r = 4
   \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks around the edge of the park. The park is a rectangle, so the perimeter (the total distance around the edge) can be calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. **First Day Customers:** Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. **Second Day Customers:** She counted 50 more customers than the first day, so:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150 \text{ customers}
   \]
3. **Total Customers by the Third Day:** The total number of customers by the third day was 500.
4. **Third Day Customers:** To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers from the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day:
   \[
   500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \text{ customers}
   \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now (in gallons).
   - Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now (in gallons).

2. **Leak Rate:**
   - Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

3. **Time Frame:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.

4. **Water Loss:**
   - In 4 minutes, each pool loses \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water.

5. **Water Amounts 4 Minutes Ago:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons.
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

6. **Relationship 4 Minutes Ago:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
     \[
     B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
     \]

7. **Current Relationship:**
   - Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
     \[
     B = 4S
     \]

8. **Solve the Equations:**
   - Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \):
     \[
     4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     4S + 16 = 2S + 32
     \]
   - Subtract \( 2S \) from both sides:
     \[
     2S + 16 = 32
     \]
   - Subtract 16 from both sides:
     \[
     2S = 16
     \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[
     S = 8
     \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%.

The additional 10% of $2000 is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, let's calculate how much she will pay in total over 12 months if she pays $165 each month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back to find the remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to:

1. Determine the number of dahlias.
2. Add the number of roses and dahlias together.

First, we know there are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Next, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

"First, let's calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has initially:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes:
- He loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- He buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

New total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his monthly plan.

1. **Daily calls with the boss**: Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day. Since there are 30 days in the month:
   \[
   15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Extra calls**: Jason has also used 300 extra minutes this month.

3. **Total minutes used**: Add the minutes from daily calls and extra calls:
   \[
   450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Minutes left**: Subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan:
   \[
   1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes}
   \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin:
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19 \text{ fries}
   \]
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries}
   \]
   So, after Billy takes his fries:
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took:
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries}
   \]
   So, after Colby takes his fries:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7 \text{ fries}
   \]
5. Ginger gives Griffin some fries, and in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of snails in each aquarium:**
   - Aquarium 1: 4 snails
   - Aquarium 2: 32 snails

2. **Calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:**
   \[
   32 - 4 = 28
   \]

3. **Let \( f \) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).**

4. **According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish:**
   \[
   28 = 2 \times 2f
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation to find \( f \):**
   \[
   28 = 4f
   \]
   \[
   f = \frac{28}{4}
   \]
   \[
   f = 7
   \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( 7 \).

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
2. It takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day.
3. Jean needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
4. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
5. After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount.

Now, let's calculate the total cost step by step:

1. Calculate the cost for one day:
   \[
   \text{Cost per day} = 250 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 1500 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate the cost for one week:
   \[
   \text{Cost per week} = 1500 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 6000 \, \text{dollars/week}
   \]

3. Calculate the cost for 5 weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 6000 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 30000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. Calculate the discount:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 30000 \, \text{dollars} \times 0.10 = 3000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

5. Calculate the final cost after the discount:
   \[
   \text{Final cost} = 30000 \, \text{dollars} - 3000 \, \text{dollars} = 27000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

So, Jean paid:

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body, so:
   \[
   \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches}
   \]
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:
   \[
   \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches}
   \]
4. The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[
900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches}
\]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves. Let \( x \) be the number of stitches for one sleeve. Since there are two sleeves, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is \( 2x \).

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is:
\[
1170 + 2x = 1800
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
2x = 1800 - 1170
\]
\[
2x = 630
\]
\[
x = \frac{630}{2}
\]
\[
x = 315
\]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"First, we calculate the number of cards with the letter A on them:
\[ \text{Number of A cards} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining cards after the A cards are accounted for:
\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we calculate the number of cards with the letter B on them:
\[ \text{Number of B cards} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining cards after the B cards are accounted for:
\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Then, we calculate the number of cards with the letter C on them:
\[ \text{Number of C cards} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. 

1. Mico and Marco's current ages add up to 20.
2. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older.
3. So, in 10 years, Mico will be 10 years older, and Marco will also be 10 years older.
4. The total increase in their ages will be 10 + 10 = 20 years.
5. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be their current sum of ages (20) plus the total increase (20).

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

20 + 20 = 40

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones in the necklace.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Determine how many sterling silver beads fit into the remaining length.

First, we know that each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we subtract the total length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so we divide the remaining length by the length of one bead to find the number of beads:
\[ 17 \text{ inches} \div 0.25 \text{ inches/bead} = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, the cost of the flight ticket:
$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

Adding up all the expenses so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
$6000 (total money) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

So, Theo has $2050 left to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60,000 \times 2 = 120,000\).

The population of Chile now is:

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

4. Calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers.
5. Calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers.
6. Add the total monthly salaries of junior and senior programmers to get the total amount paid to all programmers.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees.
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]

2. The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers.

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. John spends 6 hours boating.
2. He spends half that time swimming, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.
3. He watches 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so he spends \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours watching shows.
4. The total time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows is \( 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \) hours.
5. This 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation.

Let's denote the total time John spent on vacation as \( T \). According to the problem, 15 hours is 30% of \( T \):

\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how much time he spent sightseeing. The problem states that he spent 40% of his time sightseeing:

\[ \text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.40 \times T = 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:

"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job:
- She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours.
- So, she earns \( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job:
- She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours.
- So, she earns \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money she has:
- She already has $80 in savings.
- From her first job, she earns $200.
- From her second job, she earns $75.
- So, the total amount of money she has is \( 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \) dollars.

Finally, let's determine how much more money she needs to save to buy the phone:
- The phone costs $400.
- She has $355.
- So, she still needs \( 400 - 355 = 45 \) dollars.

   \]
3. The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:
   \[
   6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree, so:

"To figure out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first determine the total cost for one person to participate in all the activities she wants to do.

1. **Mini-golf**: $5 per round
2. **Arcade tokens**: $5
3. **Go-karts**: $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so $10 x 2 = $20

Now, let's add up the total cost for one person:
\[ 5 \text{ (mini-golf)} + 5 \text{ (arcade tokens)} + 20 \text{ (go-karts)} = 30 \]

So, it costs $30 for one person to do all the activities.

Morgan has a total budget of $90. We need to subtract the cost for Morgan herself:
\[ 90 - 30 = 60 \]

Now, we need to see how many friends can be invited with the remaining $60:
\[ 60 \div 30 = 2 \]

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
4 lollipops * 25 cents = 100 cents = $1

So, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day. 

Next, let's find out how much she saves each day:
$5 - $1 = $4

Now, let's calculate how much she saves over 5 days:
$4 * 5 = $20

So, the amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days is:

"First, let's figure out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost for the gumballs is:

40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.00

Since this $2.00 is half of his change, the total change he received after buying the candy is:

$2.00 * 2 = $4.00

Now, we know that Billy started with $10 and ended up with $4 in change, so the amount he spent on candy is:

$10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00

The candy costs $1.50 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy he bought is:

$6.00 / $1.50/pound = 4 pounds

According to the problem:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

"First, let's figure out the total distance the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities.

1. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
2. The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
3. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs.

The combined distance of the first two legs is:
\[ 75 + 100 = 175 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance from the third city to the first city is:
\[ 175 - 50 = 125 \text{ miles} \]

Now, the total distance for one complete trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total service distance by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18,000}{900} = 20 \]

So, the train goes between services every 20 days.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to determine what fraction of his land he still has after selling 3/5 of it. 

If he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares. 

To find the total amount of land he had initially, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times \text{Total Land} = 12.8 \text{ hectares}
\]

To solve for the total land, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2:

\[
\text{Total Land} = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's calculate:

\[
12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

52 members * 50% = 26 girls

On the day of the performance, only the girls are performing. However, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

26 girls / 2 = 13 girls

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

13 girls + 3 teachers = 16 people

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to determine how many popsicles each of them has based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. To find out how many popsicles each part represents, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so:
\[ \text{Betty's popsicles} = 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has 6 parts, so:
\[ \text{Sam's popsicles} = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To find out how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then compare it to the cable package.

1. **Cost of Netflix:**
   - Netflix costs $10 a month.

2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the bundle discount:**
   - Normally, each service costs $10 a month.
   - The total cost for both without the discount is $10 + $10 = $20.
   - With a 20% discount, the savings are 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for both services with the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

3. **Total cost of all streaming services:**
   - Netflix: $10
   - Hulu and Disney Plus: $16
   - Total: $10 + $16 = $26

4. **Savings by cancelling the cable package:**
   - Cable package cost: $60
   - Total cost of streaming services: $26
   - Savings: $60 - $26 = $34

So, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his $60 cable package.

"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.
2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the year.

Step 1: Number of days worked in a month
- The builder works 4 weeks every month.
- Each week, he works 6 days.
- So, the number of days worked in a month is \( 4 \text{ weeks/month} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days/month} \).

"To find out how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner.
2. Determine the reduction in daily energy usage.
3. Calculate the total energy saved over 30 days.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner.**

The air conditioner uses 900 watts (0.9 kilowatts) per hour. Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.

\[ \text{Daily energy usage} = 0.9 \, \text{kW} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7.2 \, \text{kWh} \]

**Step 2: Determine the reduction in daily energy usage.**

If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the new usage time is:

\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The new daily energy usage is:

\[ 0.9 \, \text{kW} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2.7 \, \text{kWh} \]

The reduction in daily energy usage is:

\[ 7.2 \, \text{kWh} - 2.7 \, \text{kWh} = 4.5 \, \text{kWh} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total energy saved over 30 days.**

\[ \text{Total energy saved} = 4.5 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kWh} \]

So, the total energy saved in 30 days is:

"To find out how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people.
2. Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed.
3. Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Determine the number of sandwiches needed.**
- Each sandwich serves 4 people.
- There are 20 people.
- Number of sandwiches needed = 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed.**
- Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
- For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.
- For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of cheese needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese.**
- Cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
- Cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Hours per week: 40
   - Weeks in a month: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

   First, calculate the weekly pay for one employee:
   \[
   \text{Weekly pay} = 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} = 600 \, \text{dollars/week}

   Then, calculate the monthly pay for one employee:
   \[
   \text{Monthly pay} = 600 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks/month} = 2400 \, \text{dollars/month}
   \]

   Finally, calculate the total payment for all employees in May:
   \[
   \text{Total payment for May} = 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars}

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of candles that are likely to explode.
2. Determine the number of candles that have the defect making them smell like wet dog.
3. Calculate the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog.

### Step 1: Determine the number of candles that are likely to explode
Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles are likely to explode.

\[ \text{Number of candles that explode} = 1\% \times 50000 \]
\[ \text{Number of candles that explode} = 0.01 \times 50000 \]
\[ \text{Number of candles that explode} = 500 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of candles that have the defect making them smell like wet dog
5% of the more dangerous candles (those that are likely to explode) have this defect.

\[ \text{Number of candles that smell like wet dog} = 5\% \times 500 \]
\[ \text{Number of candles that smell like wet dog} = 0.05 \times 500 \]
\[ \text{Number of candles that smell like wet dog} = 25 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog
Since the 25 candles that smell like wet dog are a subset of the 500 candles that are likely to explode, the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog is 25.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, let's call this number \( x \).

Now, for her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

First, solve the first equation for \( C \):
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is:
\[ 56 \]"
"To find out how many kilometers Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and add up the distances.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - He traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - He traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first 4 days.
   - 30% of 800 km: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).
   - Total distance for the next 2 days: 240 km.

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - He wasn't traveling at all.
   - Total distance for this day: 0 km.

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we add up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next 1 day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance traveled: \( 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \).

"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the comb's elevation.

First, we know that Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. So, the comb landed at:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

So, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the amounts he received from the two banks to his initial capital.

1. The first bank gave him $4000.
2. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.
3. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital.

Now, we add these amounts together:
$4000 (from the first bank) + $8000 (from the second bank) + $5000 (initial capital) = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

"To find out how much 2 years of the service cost Bill, we need to break down the costs into the different periods and then sum them up.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **Remaining 10 months at $14 per month:**
   - 2 years is 24 months.
   - The first 6 months and the next 8 months account for 14 months.
   - Therefore, the remaining months are:
     \[
     24 \text{ months} - 14 \text{ months} = 10 \text{ months}
     \]
   - The cost for these 10 months is:
     \[
     10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
     \]

4. **Total cost for 2 years:**
   \[
   \$48 + \$96 + \$140 = \$284

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 and saved $4, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 and saved $2, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles rented.

1. **Buses:**
   - Each bus can hold 60 employees.
   - There are 4 buses.
   - Total capacity of buses = 4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees.

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Each minibus can hold 30 employees.
   - There are 6 minibusses.
   - Total capacity of minibusses = 6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees.

3. **Minivans:**
   - Each minivan can hold 15 employees.
   - There are 10 minivans.
   - Total capacity of minivans = 10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees.

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles:

- Total capacity = 240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees.

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Kenny needed to make from selling the cards to cover the cost of the amusement park ticket and the spending cash.
2. Calculate how many cards he sold to make that amount of money.
3. Determine the total number of cards he had initially, considering he kept 1/3 of them.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kenny needed:
- Cost of the amusement park ticket: $100
- Spending cash: $50
- Total amount needed: $100 + $50 = $150

Next, we need to find out how many cards he sold to make $150. Each card is sold for $1.5:
- Number of cards sold = Total amount needed / Price per card
- Number of cards sold = $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, which means he sold 2/3 of his cards. Let's denote the total number of cards he started with as \( x \):
- Number of cards sold = 2/3 * x
- 100 = 2/3 * x

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
- x = 100 * (3/2)
- x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 1 hotdog for each of the remaining 18 guests.
   - So, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 (for the second hotdogs) + 18 (for the first hotdogs) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs needed is 80.
   - The shortage is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26 / 2 = 13 guests.

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

"Let's break down the costs and savings to find the regular price of the popcorn.

1. **Cost with the super ticket:**
   - Movie super ticket: $20
   - One popcorn and a soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost without the super ticket:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Soda: $3
   - Popcorn: Let's call the price of the popcorn \( P \)
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + $3 + \( P \) = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.
   - So, $15 + \( P \) = $21 - $2
   - $15 + \( P \) = $19

4. **Solve for \( P \):**
   - \( P \) = $19 - $15
   - \( P \) = $4

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then divide the total distance by the total time.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - For the first part of the trip, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours.
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - For the second part of the trip, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour.
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - Total distance:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time spent at each speed.
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - Average speed is the total distance divided by the total time.
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is found by multiplying the length by the width by the height.

For one raised bed:
- Length = 8 feet
- Width = 2 feet
- Height = 2 feet

Volume of one raised bed = 8 feet * 2 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total cost = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of puppies.
2. Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.
3. Divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies.
4. Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.

First, let's find the total number of puppies:
- Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies.
- Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.
- Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, let's find the total number of puppies with spots:
- Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots.
- Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.
- Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:
- Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
- Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100

Let's do the division and multiplication:
- (7 / 20) = 0.35
- 0.35 * 100 = 35

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%.

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and then divide that by the truck's capacity.

1. **Sugar cubes**: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
2. **Carrots**: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
3. **Hay**: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
4. **Oats**: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, add up all the weights:
- Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
- Total weight = 4500 pounds

Next, divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find out how many trips are needed:
- Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
- Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
- Number of trips = 2

Since the result is a whole number, the farmer needs exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To figure out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Let \( c \) be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, who has 20 songs. 

So, Luri has:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. The media player can hold up to 100 songs.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ songs} \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ songs} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of songs they can each add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

"To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation where the total cost for each venue is the same.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost per guest: $5
- Total cost for the first venue: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25
- Total cost for the second venue: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) where the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( B \) represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
2. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects.
3. Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.

According to the problem, the total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \left( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \right) = 43 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ B + B + 7 = 43 \]

\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 2B = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ B = 18 \]

Now, we know Bodhi found 18 insects. 

Next, we find the number of insects David found:

\[ \frac{B}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Finally, we find the number of insects Lily found:

\[ \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the cost of the lot be \( L \).
2. According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so the cost of the house is \( 3L \).
3. The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   L + 3L = 120,000

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Tony's picking rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's picking rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony.
   - Bobby's rate = 6 quarts/hour - 1 quart/hour = 5 quarts/hour.

3. **Kathy's picking rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby.
   - Kathy's rate = 2 * 5 quarts/hour = 10 quarts/hour.

4. **Ricky's picking rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.
   - Ricky's rate = 10 quarts/hour - 2 quarts/hour = 8 quarts/hour.

5. **Total picking rate:**
   - Total rate = Tony's rate + Bobby's rate + Kathy's rate + Ricky's rate
   - Total rate = 6 quarts/hour + 5 quarts/hour + 10 quarts/hour + 8 quarts/hour
   - Total rate = 29 quarts/hour

"To figure out how many rows Jackson will plant, we need to divide the total number of each type of tulip by the number that can fit in a row.

For the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- So, the number of rows of red tulips is 36 divided by 6, which is 6 rows.

For the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- So, the number of rows of blue tulips is 24 divided by 8, which is 3 rows.

Now, we add the rows of red and blue tulips together:
- 6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows in total.

So, the total number of rows Jackson will plant is:

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many cups of raisins are allocated for the oatmeal cookies.
2. Calculate how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with the allocated raisins.

First, we divide the total amount of raisins equally among the three uses (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix):

27 cups / 3 = 9 cups for oatmeal cookies

Next, we calculate how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with 9 cups of raisins, knowing that each batch requires 3/4 of a cup:

9 cups / (3/4 cup per batch) = 9 * (4/3) = 12 batches

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of chairs Ophelia has:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
   - Therefore, Ophelia has \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) chairs.

2. **Determine the number of chairs Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
   - Therefore, Jenna has \( 3 \times 22 = 66 \) chairs.

3. **Determine the number of sofas Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
   - Therefore, Jenna has \( 66 - 2 = 64 \) sofas.

4. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Ophelia's total: \( 20 \) sofas + \( 22 \) chairs = \( 42 \)

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how many CDs Tom could buy with the money he spent on the headphone set.

First, we know the total amount Tom spent is $48, and he bought a CD for $4. So, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could buy with $44. Since each CD costs $4, we divide $44 by $4:
\[ 44 \div 4 = 11 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the variations in his routine:

1. Josh usually spends 4 hours working out each week.
2. For 8 weeks, if he stuck to his usual routine, he would have spent \(8 \times 4 = 32\) hours.
3. However, there are two weeks where he spent 5 hours each, adding an extra \(5 + 5 = 10\) hours.
4. Additionally, there is one week where he spent 6 hours, adding an extra 6 hours.

Now, we need to adjust the total by adding these extra hours to the usual 32 hours:

- Extra hours from the two 5-hour weeks: \(10\) hours
- Extra hours from the one 6-hour week: \(6\) hours

So, the total extra hours are \(10 + 6 = 16\) hours.

Adding these extra hours to the usual 32 hours:

\[32 + 16 = 48\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off:
   - 48 - 8 = 40 passengers remain on the bus.
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus:
   - 5 * 8 = 40 passengers get on the bus.
   - 40 + 40 = 80 passengers are now on the bus.
4. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off:
   - 80 - 21 = 59 passengers remain on the bus.
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus:
   - 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on the bus.
   - 59 + 7 = 66 passengers are now on the bus.

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.
4. The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.
5. The remaining amount for the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.
6. Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - They are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
   - Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each boy:**
   - Each boy brought back 60 seashells.

3. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - Number of seashells brought by each girl = 60 (shells brought by each boy) + 4 * 60 (four times the shells brought by each boy)
   - Number of seashells brought by each girl = 60 + 240
   - Number of seashells brought by each girl = 300

So, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to add the thickness of each book together. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The thickness of the first book is 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so:
   \[
   50 \text{ mm} - 5 \text{ mm} = 45 \text{ mm}
   \]
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, so:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \text{ mm} = 62 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm} = 188 \text{ mm}
\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is:

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we need to add up the vlogs she has already made and subtract that total from 72.

First, let's add the vlogs she made in the first three weeks:
18 vlogs (first week) + 21 vlogs (second week) + 15 vlogs (third week) = 54 vlogs

Now, subtract the total vlogs she has made from her monthly goal:
72 vlogs (goal) - 54 vlogs (made) = 18 vlogs

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to reach her goal of 72 vlogs for the month.

"To find out how much you end up paying, first calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill:

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount:

$50 + $10 = $60

Since you are splitting the check evenly but paying the entire tip, you pay half of the original bill plus the entire tip:

Half of the original bill: $50 / 2 = $25

Total you pay: $25 (half the bill) + $10 (tip) = $35

So, you end up paying $35.

"First, we determine how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys:
\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

The eldest boy initially gets $6. He then adds $5 to his share:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]

The next day, he adds another $10:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

He then spends $8:
\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \]

After spending, he triples the amount he has left:
\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is:
\[ 39 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

1. **Determine the number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**
   - Therefore, in the first half, he saves \( 15x \) dollars.

4. **In the second half, he wants to save twice as much daily as he saves in the first half:**
   - So, he saves \( 2x \) dollars each day in the second half.
   - Therefore, in the second half, he saves \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \) dollars.

5. **Set up the equation to meet his monthly saving target:**
   - Total savings in April = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 15x + 30x = 1125 \)
   - \( 45x = 1125 \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   - Each day in the second half, he saves \( 2x \) dollars.
   - \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April."

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation. Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad gets. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"First, let's figure out how long Ray takes to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. 

Twice the time it takes in cold water is:
2 * 16 = 32 minutes

Adding 2 minutes more:
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

So, in warm water, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions.

In cold water:
3 * 16 = 48 minutes

In warm water:
3 * 34 = 102 minutes

The difference in time between warm and cold water for 3 miles is:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to add the number of hamsters and the number of guinea pigs together.

First, calculate the total number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages of hamsters.
- Each cage has 10 hamsters.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, calculate the total number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages of guinea pigs.
- Each cage has 5 guinea pigs.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = 30 (hamsters) + 15 (guinea pigs) = 45.

"First, let's figure out Susan's weight. If Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, and Mark weighs 150 pounds, then:

Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Next, let's find out Bob's weight. If Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, then:

Bob's weight = 2 × Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 × 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, to find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and divide by 3:

Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds
Total weight = 540 pounds

Average weight = Total weight / 3
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle of the sun's movement relative to the ground.

1. The initial angle of the sun from the ground is the same as the angle of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.
3. Over 10 hours, the sun will move upward by \( 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \).

To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we add the initial angle to the angle the sun has moved upward:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees.

"To find out how much James spends on candles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the ages of James's two sons.
2. Calculate the total number of candles needed.
3. Determine how many packs of candles are required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of packs.

Step 1: Determine the ages of the sons.
- One son is 12 years old.
- The other son is 4 years younger, so he is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of candles needed.
- The total number of candles needed is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Step 3: Determine how many packs of candles are required.
- Each pack contains 5 candles.
- To find out how many packs are needed, divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
- Each pack costs $3.
- The total cost is 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- So, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we need to convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Finally, we add the pages read in both weeks:
- Total pages in two weeks = \( 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old.
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.
3. At that time, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

Let's denote the current age of Shiloh's nephew as \( x \).

In 7 years, the nephew will be \( x + 7 \) years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times the nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To solve this, we need to figure out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow from 4 feet to more than 20 feet, given that it doubles in height every day.

Let's break it down day by day:

- **Day 0**: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- **Day 1**: The beanstalk doubles to 4 * 2 = 8 feet.
- **Day 2**: The beanstalk doubles to 8 * 2 = 16 feet.
- **Day 3**: The beanstalk doubles to 16 * 2 = 32 feet.

On Day 3, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than 20 feet.

So, it takes 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per day.
3. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

Step 1: Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
- 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
- Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms contain \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) grams of protein.

Step 2: Calculate the total protein intake per day.
- John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.

Step 3: Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, the total protein intake per week is \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) grams.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let Jerry's current age be \( J \).
2. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, 5 years ago, Jerry was \( J - 5 \) years old.
3. The problem states that Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   J = 2 \times (J - 5)
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   J = 2J - 10
   \]
5. Subtract \( J \) from both sides to isolate \( J \):
   \[
   0 = J - 10
   \]
6. Add 10 to both sides to solve for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 10
   \]
7. Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, add 3 to his current age:
   \[
   10 + 3 = 13
   \]

So, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To find out how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the dental work.
2. Subtract the deposit he has already paid.
3. Determine how much more money he needs.
4. Calculate how many hours he needs to work to earn that amount.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the dental work
- Each implant costs $2000.
- He needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
  \[
  2 \times 2000 = 4000
  \]
- One of the implants has an additional cost of $500 for a porcelain crown.
- Therefore, the total cost is:
  \[
  4000 + 500 = 4500
  \]

### Step 2: Subtract the deposit
- George has already paid a deposit of $600.
- The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
  \[
  4500 - 600 = 3900
  \]

### Step 3: Determine how much more money he needs
- George needs $3900 more to pay for the dental work.

### Step 4: Calculate how many hours he needs to work
- George earns $15 per hour.
- To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
  \[
  \frac{3900}{15} = 260
  \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours to pay for the dental work.

"Let's call the smallest angle \( x \). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

So, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add all the amounts together to find the total amount of money Colby has:

200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs

"To solve this problem, first, we need to find the rate at which the plane is traveling. 

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. So, the rate (speed) of the plane is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate. 

Using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Now, let's find out how many pounds Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. So, we calculate 3/4 of 120 pounds:

3/4 * 120 pounds = 90 pounds per hour

Now, we calculate how many pounds each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds

And for Marissa:

90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

Finally, we add the total pounds of chocolates made by both Ruiz and Marissa:

720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds

"To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate the earnings for each period and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- The total number of cups sold in four hours is \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \).
- The total earnings for the first four hours is \( 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30 \).

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- The total number of cups sold in two hours is \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \).
- The total earnings for the next two hours is \( 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12 \).

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires make in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires can handle before needing replacement.
3. Calculate how many months the tires will last.
4. Convert the number of months into years.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations the tires make in one month.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.

\[
\text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile}
\]

\[
\text{Total rotations per month} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations the tires can handle before needing replacement.**

Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 3: Calculate how many months the tires will last.**

\[
\text{Number of months} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months}
\]

**Step 4: Convert the number of months into years.**

\[
\text{Number of years} = \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years}

- Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second, so in one hour, she can download 20 kb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72,000 kb/hour.

Next, let's convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour:
- There are 1000 kb in 1 Mb, so 72,000 kb/hour is 72,000 kb/hour / 1000 kb/Mb = 72 Mb/hour.

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To find the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the remaining four days.

1. **First three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day.
   - Number of cars towed in the first three days: \( 10 \times 3 = 30 \) cars.

2. **Remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day compared to the first three days.
   - Number of cars towed each day for the remaining four days: \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) cars.
   - Number of cars towed in the remaining four days: \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) cars.

3. **Total number of cars towed in the week:**
   - Sum of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days: \( 30 + 24 = 54 \) cars.

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 54.

"To solve this, we need to convert the height requirement from feet to inches because Adam's height is given in inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches, so 4 feet = 48 inches.

Adam is currently 40 inches tall and needs to be 48 inches tall to ride the roller coaster. 

The difference in height is 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Adam grows 2 inches per year, so to grow 8 inches, it will take:

8 inches / 2 inches per year = 4 years.

So, Adam will need 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Determine the cost the company paid to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the acquisition cost from the total sales.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Total Sales Amount:**
   James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000.
   \[
   \text{Total Sales} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Acquisition Cost:**
   The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Acquisition Cost per Car} = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500
   \]
   For 10 cars:
   \[
   \text{Total Acquisition Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Profit:**
   The profit is the total sales minus the total acquisition cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **James's Commission:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 0.10 \times 175,000 = 17,500
   \]

So, James made:
\[
17,500

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Price of a diamond jewel:**
   - Given: $2000

2. **Price of a gold jewel:**
   - The price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   - Price of gold jewel = \( \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \)

3. **Price of a silver jewel:**
   - The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   - Price of silver jewel = 1600 - 400 = 1200

4. **Total price for all three jewels:**
   - Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
   - Total price = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

The total price for all three jewels is:

"To find out how many stamps Max bought in total, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then add them together.

1. **Snowflake stamps**: Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. **Truck stamps**: Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. **Rose stamps**: Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, we add up all the stamps:
\[
16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45
\]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is:

"To figure out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap. 

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap at this rate. We use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Plugging in the values, we get:

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To figure out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to determine the cost per class if he misses some.

1. First, calculate the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes:
   \[
   \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10 \text{ classes}} = \$6 \text{ per class}
   \]

2. Manny's parents will only continue if the cost per class is $10 or less. So, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

3. Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

4. The cost per class if he misses \( x \) classes is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10 - x}
   \]

5. We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that:
   \[
   \frac{\$60}{10 - x} \leq \$10
   \]

6. Solving the inequality:
   \[
   60 \leq 10(10 - x)
   \]
   \[
   60 \leq 100 - 10x
   \]
   \[
   10x \leq 40
   \]
   \[
   x \leq 4
   \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many customers Julie processes daily.
2. Calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a day.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week (7 days).

First, since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers per day} \]

Next, the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a day is:
\[ 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ customers per day} \]

Since they work all days of the week, the total weekly production is:
\[ 150 \times 7 = 1050 \text{ customers per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
1050"
"Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is 5 * 4 = 20 miles. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so if we let the number of miles Lynn ran be \( L \), then Reggie ran \( L + 3 \) miles. Since Reggie ran 20 miles, we can set up the equation:

\[ L + 3 = 20 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides to solve for \( L \):

\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

1. **Base price of the truck**: $30,000
2. **King cab upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{7,500}{3} = 2,500
   \]
4. **Running boards**: $500 less than the leather seats
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000
   \]
5. **Upgraded exterior light package**: $1,500
6. **Towing package**: The cost of the towing package is not provided, so we will assume it is included in the base price or is free.

Now, we add all these costs together:

"To find out how long it took Finley to cook all the food, we need to determine the cooking times for each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cooking time for rice**: Given as 30 minutes.
2. **Cooking time for pork**: It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Cooking time for beans**: Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, we calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, the cooking time for beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we sum the cooking times for all three items:
\[
30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs, since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, so for a week (7 days), he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The more expensive brand of coffee costs 20% more than the normal brand, which is $5 per pound. 

First, we calculate the cost of the more expensive coffee:
20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive coffee costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Next, we calculate the total cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee:
7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Finally, we add the cost of the donut:
$42 + $2 = $44.

So, the total cost for everything is $44.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to account for both the 50% extension and the 20cm lace trim added to the bottom.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \).

1. The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length before adding the lace trim is \( L + 0.5L = 1.5L \).
2. An additional 20cm of lace trim is added to the bottom, making the final length \( 1.5L + 20 \).

We know the final length of the dress is 140cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Now we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00
10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

The total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

4. Add the totals together.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of coins Rong saves per month.**
Rong saves 20 coins every month.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month.**
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. So, we need to find 2/5 of 20 and add it to 20.

"First, let's figure out the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the total bill as \( T \). The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract \( 0.60T \) from both sides:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of chairs required for the function and compare it to the number of chairs Mia's restaurant currently has.

1. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies.
   - Each adult needs a regular chair.
   - Each baby needs a high chair.
   - Total chairs needed = 42 (for adults) + 15 (for babies) = 57 chairs.

2. **Determine the number of chairs currently available:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   - Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs.
   - Total chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48 chairs.

3. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   - Total chairs needed = 57
   - Total chairs available = 48
   - Additional chairs needed = 57 - 48 = 9 chairs.

"To figure out how many scoops Erin can get, let's break it down:

1. Each scoop costs $1.50.
2. The deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. So for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2.

First, let's see how many scoops Erin can buy with $6.00 without considering the deal:
- $6.00 / $1.50 per scoop = 4 scoops

Now, let's apply the deal:
- For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free.
- With 4 scoops, she can get 2 sets of the deal (2 scoops + 1 free scoop).

So, for 4 scoops, she gets:
- 2 scoops + 1 free scoop (first set)
- 2 scoops + 1 free scoop (second set)

In total, she gets 4 scoops + 2 free scoops = 6 scoops.

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out what percent of Candy's spools are blue, we first need to calculate the total number of spools and the total number of blue spools.

The total number of blue spools is:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 blue spools

The total number of spools is:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 spools

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = 0.4 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = 40\% \]

"At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up to vote. By midday, 2/5 of these people had voted. 

First, let's find out how many people voted by midday:
2/5 of 5000 = (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people

So, 2000 people voted by midday. This means the number of people who had not voted by midday is:
5000 - 2000 = 3000 people

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted. Let's find out how many people that is:
2/3 of 3000 = (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people

So, 2000 more people voted by 16:00. This means the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
3000 - 2000 = 1000 people

"First, let's find out Dora's father's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice her age, we can calculate it as follows:

Dora's father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Dora's father's age = 30 + 8
Dora's father's age = 38

Next, we find out Dora's mother's age. Since Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father:

Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4
Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4
Dora's mother's age = 34

Now, we can calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find out how many votes candidate C got, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of votes candidate A received:**
   - Candidate A got 20% of the votes.
   - Total number of voters = 100.
   - Votes for candidate A = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

2. **Calculate the number of votes candidate B received:**
   - Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A.
   - 50% of candidate A's votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
   - Votes for candidate B = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. **Calculate the number of votes candidate C received:**
   - Total votes = 100.
   - Votes for candidate A = 20.
   - Votes for candidate B = 30.
   - Votes for candidate C = Total votes - (Votes for candidate A + Votes for candidate B) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

So, candidate C received 50 votes.

"First, let's figure out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has:

100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

100 - 10 = 90 apples.

And Beck will have:

77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's apples from Boris's apples:

90 - 87 = 3.

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for the ice cubes and then subtract that from the 32 ounces he started with.

1. Calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes = 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces.

2. Calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes = 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces.

3. Calculate the water used for the small cubes:
   - Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes = 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces.

4. Add up the total water used for all the cubes:
   - Total water used = 12 ounces (giant) + 14 ounces (medium) + 4 ounces (small) = 30 ounces.

5. Subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
   - Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces.

So, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

\[ \text{Number of students who like to play music} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we find the total number of students who have hobbies other than playing video games:
\[ \text{Total students with other hobbies} = 10 \, (\text{bake}) + 5 \, (\text{basketball}) + 10 \, (\text{music}) = 25 \]

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of students to find the number of students who like to play video games:

   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

5. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

6. **Total Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 3 small stickers left from the initial amount.
   - She also has 60 small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers.

3. The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house, so the third house needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases of shingles. 

The third house needs double the first house, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store.
3. After adding these 17 fish to his pond, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( O \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.
- \( W \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we know:
- \( O + W = 17 \) (total fish bought)
- After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + O \).
- After adding the new fish, the total number of white fish is \( 4 + W \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O = 8 + 2W - 3 \]
\[ O = 5 + 2W \]

Next, substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into the first equation \( O + W = 17 \):
\[ 5 + 2W + W = 17 \]
\[ 5 + 3W = 17 \]
\[ 3W = 12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has.
2. Determine the total number of stuffed animals she will have after buying the goats.
3. Set up an equation to find the number of goats that will make up 30% of the total number of stuffed animals.

First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:
- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying the goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks (14 days):

0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours

Next, let's calculate the total hours she plays in the following week. She plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week (7 days):

2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played so far:

7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour.
3. The second car is 10 miles per hour faster than the first car (70 - 60 = 10 miles per hour).

Now, if both cars continue at these speeds for 2 hours:

- The first car will travel 60 miles per hour * 2 hours = 120 miles.
- The second car will travel 70 miles per hour * 2 hours = 140 miles.

The difference in the distance they travel in 2 hours is:

140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles.

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with those chips.
3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, calculate how many inches long it can be.

First, let's calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:
- Each bag holds 72 chips.
- Milo has 2 bags.
- Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with 144 chips:
- It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch.
- Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

Now, we know the mosaic is 3 inches tall. To find out how many inches long it can be, we divide the total square inches by the height:
- Length = Total square inches / Height = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in a week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \( z \) ounces.
2. Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
3. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces.
4. The amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, so the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.
5. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

Now, we know the total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 10z = 10 \]

Solve for \( z \):

\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we need to find the amount of oil, which is \( 4z \):

\[ 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is:

"First, let's figure out how much Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $30.00

Next, we need to find out how much Roy has saved. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.40 × $30.00
40% of Anthony's savings = $12.00

Now, we add this amount to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total savings:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00
Roy's savings = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height each person can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working our way up to Naruto.

1. **Pompei's lifting height:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting height:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting height:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting height:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - \( 480 \) inches ÷ 12 = 40 feet.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance \( D \) is the same for all animals.
   - The speed of one kangaroo is \( \frac{D}{18 \text{ hours}} \).

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.
   - Therefore, the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{D}{18 \text{ hours}} = \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}} \).

3. **Calculate the total speed of four turtles:**
   - Since there are 4 turtles, their combined speed is \( 4 \times \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{4D}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{D}{9 \text{ hours}} \).

4. **Determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The time \( T \) it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by \( T = \frac{D}{\text{combined speed}} = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{9 \text{ hours}}} = 9 \text{ hours} \).

Therefore, it will take four turtles 9 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so she currently has $400 - $50 = $350.
4. She has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gives her $80, so the total from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.
5. The amount in her purse is the total she has minus the money from her job and her mom: $350 - $230 = $120.

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

1. Calculate the number of slices from the large apples:
   - Each large apple is sliced into 5 pieces.
   - Adam slices 3 large apples.
   - Total slices from large apples = 3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices.

2. Calculate the number of slices from the small apples:
   - Each small apple is sliced into 3 pieces.
   - Adam slices 5 small apples.
   - Total slices from small apples = 5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices.

3. Calculate the total number of slices:
   - Total slices = slices from large apples + slices from small apples
   - Total slices = 15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices.

4. Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract the number of slices he eats from the total number of slices:
   - Slices left = total slices - slices eaten
   - Slices left = 30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices.

So, the number of apple slices left is 15.

2. I am 2 years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.

Let's use variables to represent the ages:
- Let \( B \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( I \) be my age.
- Let \( S \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( M \) be my mom's age.

From the information given:
1. \( I = B - 3 \)
2. \( I = S + 2 \)
3. \( M = 3B - 1 \)
4. \( I + B + S + M = 87 \)

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( I \):
\[ S = I - 2 \]

Now, substitute \( I \) and \( S \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation for the sum of the ages:
\[ I = B - 3 \]
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]
\[ M = 3B - 1 \]

Now, substitute these into the sum equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find my age \( I \):
\[ I = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.
2. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
3. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 \) books, which simplifies to \( F + 13 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is 85. So, we can write the equation:

\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( F \):

\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Melanie's current age:**
   - In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.
   - Therefore, her current age is \( 18 - 10 = 8 \) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for when her age will be three times her current age:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age.
   - In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \).
   - We need this age to be three times her current age, so:
     \[
     8 + x = 3 \times 8
     \]

3. **Solve the equation:**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     8 + x = 24
     \]
   - Subtract 8 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 24 - 8

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly has in her cart:

1. **Bacon**: 5 packs cost $10 in total, so each pack costs:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packs of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately, and then add them together.

1. **Material for small masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, 1 small mask requires \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Material for large masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, 1 large mask requires \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

3. **Total material needed:**
   - Adding the material for small and large masks: \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of times she saw the movies.

First, let's calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies:
- There are 9 Fast and the Furious movies.
- She saw each movie 3 times.

Total number of times she saw the movies = 9 movies * 3 times per movie = 27 times

Next, we divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of times she saw the movies:
- Total amount spent = $216
- Total number of times = 27

Average price per ticket = $216 / 27 = $8

So, the average price she paid per ticket is:

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends on different activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours a day.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the hours spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total hours spent on activities:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day, so the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. 

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes, so:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes, so:
1/3 * 9 = 3 red shoe boxes used.

Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes left.

Adding the remaining blue and red shoe boxes together:
4 blue + 6 red = 10 shoe boxes left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Duncan's age eight years ago:**
   - Duncan's current age is 60.
   - Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).

2. **Express the relationship between Duncan's age eight years ago and Adam's age four years ago:**
   - According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago.
   - Let \( A \) be Adam's current age.
   - Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
   - Therefore, \( 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \).

3. **Solve for Adam's current age:**
   - \( 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \)
   - Divide both sides by 2: \( 26 = A - 4 \)
   - Add 4 to both sides: \( A = 30 \)

4. **Determine Adam's age in 8 years:**
   - Adam's current age is 30.
   - In 8 years, Adam's age will be \( 30 + 8 = 38 \).

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the time it takes to complete an extreme Sudoku puzzle:**
   - A normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes.
   - An extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 4 times as long as a normal Sudoku puzzle.
   - Therefore, the time for an extreme Sudoku puzzle is \( 45 \times 4 = 180 \) minutes.

2. **Calculate the number of bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes:**
   - John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes).
   - To find out how many bottles he drinks in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30.
   - \( 180 \div 30 = 6 \)

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes to complete an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of yellow balloons based on the information given.

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There were 20 red balloons.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces of bologna per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces of bologna} \]

Next, subtract the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons from the total number of pieces of bologna to find the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces of bologna} - 40 \text{ pieces of bologna for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces of bologna for yellow balloons} \]

Now, determine the number of yellow balloons by dividing the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by the number of pieces of bologna per yellow balloon:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces of bologna}}{3 \text{ pieces of bologna per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is:

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they had the same amount of allowance.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 = 6 sets of 2 balloons
   - 6 sets * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, add up all the costs:
- Total cost = $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they had the same amount of allowance:
- Total allowance = $28
- Each girl's allowance = $28 / 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Total number of lollipops sold:**
   - Each student sold 10 lollipops.
   - There are 30 students.
   - Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

2. **Total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   - Each lollipop is sold for $0.8.
   - Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240.

3. **Total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   - Each lollipop costs $0.5.
   - Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150.

4. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $240 - $150 = $90.

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

2. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
3. Multiply the calories per mini cinnamon roll by the number of mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Multiply the calories per mini blueberry muffin by the number of mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

First, let's calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Calories in one mini cinnamon roll = 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Calories in one mini blueberry muffin = 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls:
- Number of mini cinnamon rolls = 200.
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls = 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, let's calculate the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins:
- Number of mini blueberry muffins = 300.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins = 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Finally, let's add the total calories from both types of pastries:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( P \) be Peter's age.
2. Let \( J \) be John's age.
3. Let \( L \) be Paul's age.

We are given the following information:
- The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + J + L = 100 \).
- Paul is 10 years older than John: \( L = J + 10 \).
- Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age: \( P = L + J \).

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + J + (J + 10) = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + J + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, find \( L \):
\[ L = J + 10 \]
\[ L = 20 + 10 \]
\[ L = 30 \]

Finally, find \( P \):
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]
\[ P = 2(20) + 10 \]
\[ P = 40 + 10 \]
\[ P = 50 \]

So, Peter's age is 50.

"First, let's figure out how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate the amount for the sheep as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds.
Three pounds less than that: \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds.

Now, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep:

For the goats: \(15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \text{ pounds}\).
For the sheep: \(12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds}\).

Adding these together gives the total amount of hay needed:

\(75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds}\).

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored the most points.
3. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
4. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Dinar as \( D \), and by Bahati as \( B \).

From the information given:
- \( B = A + 20 \)
- \( B = D + 10 \)
- \( B + A + D = 45 \)

We can substitute \( B \) from the first equation into the third equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + D = 45 \]
\[ 2A + 20 + D = 45 \]
\[ 2A + D = 25 \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ (D + 10) + A + D = 45 \]
\[ A + 2D + 10 = 45 \]
\[ A + 2D = 35 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 2A + D = 25 \)
2. \( A + 2D = 35 \)

We can solve this system by elimination. First, multiply the first equation by 2:
\[ 4A + 2D = 50 \]

Now subtract the second equation from this result:
\[ (4A + 2D) - (A + 2D) = 50 - 35 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of sheets of paper in the book.
2. Calculate the total number of pages based on the number of sheets.

First, we know that the book is 1.5 inches thick and there are 100 pages per inch. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Since each sheet of paper has two pages (one on each side), the number of sheets of paper is:
\[ \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages per sheet}} = 75 \text{ sheets} \]

However, the question asks for the total number of pages, which we already calculated as 150.

"Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours or 480 minutes. 

On the day she sleepwalked, she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. 

She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she lost an additional 5 minutes of sleep.

So, the total time she lost is 23 minutes (sleepwalking) + 5 minutes (waking up early) = 28 minutes.

Therefore, the total time she slept on her bed that day is 480 minutes - 28 minutes = 452 minutes.

"First, let's determine how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. 

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups. 

To find the number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has initially:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Number of measuring spoons} = 24 + 16 = 40 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we subtract these from the total number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils remaining:
\[ \text{Total utensils remaining} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

1000 beds - 200 beds = 800 beds unoccupied

Next, we need to calculate how many patients are admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day:

50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, we add these 700 patients to the initially occupied 200 beds:

200 beds + 700 beds = 900 beds occupied

Finally, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds:

1000 beds - 900 beds = 100 beds unoccupied

"To solve this, let's use some simple math. We need to find out how many Pokemon each person has caught, but we only know the total and some clues about how their numbers compare.

1. Let's say Adelwolfe has caught \( A \) Pokemon.
2. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
3. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]
\[ 9A = 339 + 21 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = \frac{360}{9} \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon, we can find out how many Stan has caught:
\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of states in the USA and then use that information to find the number of states in India.

1. The USA has 50 states.
2. India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.
3. Half the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).
4. India has 4 more than 25 states, which is \( 25 + 4 = 29 \) states.

Now, we add the number of states in both countries together:
- USA: 50 states
- India: 29 states

Total number of states in both countries: \( 50 + 29 = 79 \).

"First, we need to find out how much money Tyler needs in total to buy the books. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

So, the total cost of the books is:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14. So, the amount of money he still needs is:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"First, let's figure out how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. So, Richard has:

30 - 10 = 20 cherries

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. If Robert has 30 and Richard has 20, together they have:

30 + 20 = 50 cherries

This means Jerry has the remaining cherries:

60 - 50 = 10 cherries

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

30 - 10 = 20

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use each day.
2. Multiply the daily amount by the number of days she will be outside.
3. Divide the total amount of sunscreen needed by the size of the bottles to find out how many bottles she will need.

Step 1: Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour. If she is outside for 4 hours a day, she will use:
\[ 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \]

Step 2: Over 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is:
\[ 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 3: Each bottle contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the size of the bottles:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

2. **Determine Emil's dad's age when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Let \( D \) be the age of Emil's dad when Emil turns 24.
   - Therefore, \( 24 = \frac{D}{2} \).
   - Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = 24 \times 2 = 48 \).

3. **Determine Emil's dad's current age:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Emil's dad is currently \( 48 - 5 = 43 \) years old.

4. **Determine Emil's brother's age when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Let \( B \) be the age of Emil's brother when Emil turns 24.
   - Therefore, \( 24 = 2B \).
   - Solving for \( B \), we get \( B = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \).

5. **Determine Emil's brother's current age:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his brother will be 12 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Emil's brother is currently \( 12 - 5 = 7 \) years old.

6. **Calculate the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now:**
   - Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.
   - Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

"To find out how many servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days and then divide that by the amount that constitutes one serving.

1. **Thursday's catch**: Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
2. **Friday's catch**: Joe caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday. 
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. **Saturday's catch**: Joe caught half the amount he caught on Friday.
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we add up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by 3 to find the number of servings:
\[
\frac{21}{3} = 7
\]

So, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many flowers Pat can fit in her flower bed and how many more she needs to buy.

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Determine the total space each plant needs:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant, including the space between it and the next plant, needs 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet.

3. **Calculate the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is 111 / 2.5 = 44.4.
   - Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

4. **Determine how many more plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - She needs 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is 27 * 6 = $162.

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"To find out how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the total cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply that by 5.

1. Calculate the cost of the petunias for one basket:
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - Katherine wants 3 petunias in each basket.
   - Cost of petunias for one basket = 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00.

2. Calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines for one basket:
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - Katherine wants 2 sweet potato vines in each basket.
   - Cost of sweet potato vines for one basket = 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00.

3. Calculate the total cost for one basket:
   - Total cost for one basket = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

4. Calculate the total cost for all 5 baskets:
   - Total cost for 5 baskets = 5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00.

"First, let's figure out how much soil is used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They plant 4 sunflowers, so 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds of soil.

- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They plant 10 carnations, so 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds of soil.

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds of soil.

The total bag of soil is 30 pounds, so the remaining soil is:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds of soil.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so with 3 pounds of soil, they can plant:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses.

"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the task into two parts: peeling and sauteing.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sauteing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To saute 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can saute in one batch and then multiply by the time it takes to saute one batch:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - Add the time to peel the shrimp and the time to saute the shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

So, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Air conditioner on low for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate on low: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees

2. **Air conditioner on high for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate on high: 3 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees

3. **Air conditioner off for 2 hours:**
   - Warming rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total warming: 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:

- Total cooling: 6 degrees (low) + 12 degrees (high) = 18 degrees
- Total warming: 4 degrees

Net change in temperature:
- Net cooling: 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Three times the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time difference between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we need to find out how old Bill was 75 years before he was 90 years old.
   - \(90 - 75 = 15\)

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of trips the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips in one day.

2. **Determine the number of trips to Greece:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of trips to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips.

3. **Determine the number of trips to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.
   - Since these 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, the number of trips to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) trips.

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:

"To find out how many porcupines will be in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of female porcupines.
2. Calculate the number of babies born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
4. Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population.

Step 1: Determine the number of female porcupines.
The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.
\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of babies born each month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
\[ \text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.
\[ \text{Total babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Step 4: Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population.
\[ \text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ 826 \]"

"To find out the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 0.07 \times 3x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.79x = 28 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{28}{0.79} \approx 35.44\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 0.09 \times 5y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is 35.44%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.55y = 35.44 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{35.44}{0.55} \approx 64.44\%
     \]

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 64.44%.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment.
2. Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.
3. Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.
4. Determine how many weeks it will take for Janet to save the required amount.

### Step 1: Calculate the down payment
The cost of the car is $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

### Step 2: Determine Janet's total earnings per hour
Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips.
\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

### Step 3: Calculate Janet's total earnings per week
Janet works 40 hours a week.
\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

### Step 4: Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up these amounts to find the total spent so far:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future price of the carrots.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the carrots.
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \)
- \( n = 3 \)

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

"To find out how many portraits and selfies Olivia had, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pictures are in each album.
2. Calculate the total number of pictures in the albums that are selfies.
3. Calculate the total number of pictures in the albums that are portraits.
4. Add the number of selfies and portraits together.

First, we know Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and put them into 8 albums with the same number of pictures in each album. So, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[ \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Next, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies only. So, the total number of selfies is:

\[ \text{Total selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

We also know that 2 of the albums are portraits. So, the total number of portraits is:

\[ \text{Total portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Finally, we add the number of selfies and portraits together to get the total number of selfies and portraits:

\[ \text{Total selfies and portraits} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine the rate at which he reads and then use that rate to calculate the time for 18 pages.

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. 

To find the time it takes to read 1 page, we divide the time by the number of pages:
\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find the time it takes to read 18 pages:
\[ \text{Time for 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

\[ \text{Time for 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times 3.3333 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions = 60
   - Percentage of easy questions = 40%
   - Number of easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24

   The remaining questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions.
   - Number of remaining questions = 60 - 24 = 36
   - Number of average questions = 36 / 2 = 18
   - Number of difficult questions = 36 / 2 = 18

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct.
     - Number of easy questions correct = 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18

   - Let \( S \) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.
   - Let \( L \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - The price of a small stuffed animal is $4.
   - The price of a large stuffed animal is \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

2. **Set up the relationships:**
   - Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones: \( S = 2L \).
   - The total earnings from the sales is $120.

3. **Write the equation for total earnings:**
   - The total earnings from small stuffed animals is \( 4S \).
   - The total earnings from large stuffed animals is \( 12L \).
   - The total earnings equation is: \( 4S + 12L = 120 \).

4. **Substitute \( S = 2L \) into the total earnings equation:**
   - \( 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \)
   - \( 8L + 12L = 120 \)
   - \( 20L = 120 \)

5. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - \( L = \frac{120}{20} \)
   - \( L = 6 \)

6. **Find \( S \):**

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty.
2. Calculate Melissa's total earnings from the jury duty.
3. Calculate Melissa's total expenses.
4. Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find the net earnings.
5. Divide the net earnings by the total number of hours to find the pay per hour after expenses.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Total hours spent:**
   - Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days.
   - Total hours = 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours

2. **Total earnings:**
   - Melissa is paid $15 per day.
   - Total earnings = $15/day * 3 days = $45

3. **Total expenses:**
   - Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day.
   - Total expenses = $3/day * 3 days = $9

4. **Net earnings:**
   - Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
   - Net earnings = $45 - $9 = $36

5. **Pay per hour after expenses:**
   - Pay per hour = Net earnings / Total hours
   - Pay per hour = $36 / 18 hours = $2

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many soda bottles Richard will place and how long it will take him to drop the candy into each bottle.

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles.

2. **Calculate the time to drop the candy into each bottle:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he doesn't need to move to reach the first bottle.
   - He needs to move from one bottle to the next, and it takes him 5 seconds to do so.
   - He has to move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Time to move between bottles = 7 pairs * 5 seconds per pair = 35 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total amount of loans Jim took:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the total income Jim lost by not working during college:**
   - Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to cover the loans and the lost income:**
   - Total amount = Total loans + Total income lost
   - Total amount = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - Jim's new income is triple his previous income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net income Jim earns each year after college:**
   - Net income per year = New income - Previous income
   - Net income per year = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year

6. **Calculate the number of years it will take Jim to earn the total amount of money needed:**
   - Number of years = Total amount / Net income per year
   - Number of years = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years

So, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To find out how many letters the post office delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Adding 17 to this: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
   - So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Adding 5 to this: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)
   - So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

4. **Total letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Sum of letters delivered on each day: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount he lost in the first race is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - He won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - He won $11 in the second race.
   - He lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost and the total amount he won:

- Total amount lost: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\) dollars.
- Total amount won: \(11\) dollars.

Net loss for the day:
- Net loss = Total amount lost - Total amount won
- Net loss = \(21.5 - 11 = 10.5\) dollars.

To find the average loss per race, we divide the net loss by the number of races:

- Number of races = 3
- Average loss = \(\frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5\) dollars.

So, the average loss per race is:

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert all heights to the same unit (inches).
2. Calculate the new heights for both Cole and Xavier.
3. Find the difference between their new heights.

First, let's convert Xavier's initial height from feet to inches:
- Xavier was 4 feet tall.
- 1 foot = 12 inches.
- So, 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Next, add the growth to Xavier's initial height:
- Xavier grew 3 inches.
- New height of Xavier = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Now, let's consider Cole's initial height:
- Cole was 50 inches tall.
- Cole grew 2 inches.
- New height of Cole = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Finally, find the difference between Cole and Xavier's new heights:
- Difference = 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

"Let's denote the amount the first person took as \( x \).

The second person took \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.
2. In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

According to the problem, the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. So, we can write the equation:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve this equation, first combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. 

1. The car was bought in 2007 for $20,000.
2. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year.

The formula to calculate the price after depreciation is:
\[ \text{Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here:
- Initial Price = $20,000
- Depreciation Rate = 21% = 0.21
- Number of Years = 2010 - 2007 = 3

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Price} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Price} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Price} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Price} = 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

- Friday: 25 classes

Now, we add them all together:

\[ 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 \]

Let's do the addition step by step:

\[ 32 + 64 = 96 \]
\[ 96 + 96 = 192 \]
\[ 192 + 30 = 222 \]
\[ 222 + 25 = 247 \]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

"First, let's figure out how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
70% of 20 = 0.70 * 20 = 14 pizzas

So, the glee club has:
20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left

Next, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which means:
2 * 20 = 40 pizzas

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
80% of 40 = 0.80 * 40 = 32 pizzas

So, the football team has:
40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left

Now, add the pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team:
6 + 8 = 14 pizzas

"To find out how much Anthony spends on postage, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then add them together.

1. **Number of small coupons**: 700
2. **Number of big coupons**: Twice as many as small coupons, so \( 700 \times 2 = 1400 \)

3. **Cost to mail one small coupon**: 5 cents
4. **Total cost for small coupons**: \( 700 \times 5 = 3500 \) cents

5. **Cost to mail one big coupon**: 15 cents
6. **Total cost for big coupons**: \( 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \) cents

7. **Total cost for all coupons**: \( 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \) cents

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:

"Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter to make 6 dozen croissants, as he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.

The grocery store has a promotion: buy one pound of butter, get one half off. The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.

For every 2 pounds of butter:
- The first pound costs $4.00.
- The second pound costs $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00.

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, he will buy 3 sets of 2 pounds each:
- 3 sets * $6.00 per set = $18.00.

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $18.00.

"First, let's figure out the total number of people Kayla invited:
- 25 classmates
- 7 girls from her dance class
- 13 family members

Total invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who said they could not come:
Total attending = 45 - 4 = 41 people

The theater has a base fee for 20 people, which is $125. For each additional guest beyond the 20, there is an extra charge of $6.

Number of additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:
21 * $6 = $126

Now, we add the base fee to the cost for the additional guests:
Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251

So, the total cost for the party is:

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys each day.
2. Subtract this amount from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys each day to find out how many the third monkey eats.

First, let's determine the daily banana consumption for the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys each day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Now, we need to find out the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys each day. Since 315 bananas last for a week (7 days), the total daily consumption is:
\[ \frac{315 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Finally, we subtract the total daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"First, let's figure out the cost of the 15 roses Jenny bought. 

Roses cost $2 each, but there's a special price for a dozen, which is $15. Since Jenny bought 15 roses, she can get one dozen for $15 and the remaining 3 roses at $2 each.

The cost for the dozen roses is $15.
The cost for the 3 additional roses is 3 * $2 = $6.

So, the total cost for 15 roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which totals to 5 * $5 = $25.

The amount of money Jenny has left after buying the roses is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $4 into quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the number of quarters she gets is $4 / $0.25 = 16.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"To find out how much Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:**
   - Jenny buys 10 bunches.
   - Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
   - Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

2. **Calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:**
   - Cost per banana = $0.80.
   - Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

3. **Calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:**
   - Cost per bunch = $3.00.
   - Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

4. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches.
   - Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet.
2. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.
3. The total amount of fence they have together is 100 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   S + (S + 60) = 100
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2S + 60 = 100
   \]
5. Subtract 60 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
   \[
   2S = 40

6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 20

Next, we calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each day:
- Each period is 40 minutes long
- Total minutes per day: 8 periods * 40 minutes/period = 320 minutes

Now, we calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each week:
- He goes to class 5 days a week
- Total minutes per week: 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes

John also spends extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. The extra time is 1/16 of his weekly class time:
- Extra learning time per day: 1600 minutes/week * 1/16 = 100 minutes/day
- Total extra learning time for the weekend: 100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes

Now, we add the extra learning time to the total class time to get the total weekly learning time:
- Total weekly learning time: 1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of days
- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total number of days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

### Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off
Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Number of days off = 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

### Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works
Number of days Billy works = Total number of days - Number of days off
Number of days Billy works = 50 - 10 = 40 days

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps
Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.

Number of people helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Total number of people helped = Number of people helped per day * Number of days worked

"Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so her balance decreased by $15.00:

\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount on the frying pan is:

\[ 20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00 \]

So, the cost of the frying pan after the discount is:

\[ 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00 \]

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. The discount on the towels is:

\[ 30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00 \]

So, the cost of the towels after the discount is:

\[ 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00 \]

Adding the cost of the frying pan and the towels to her current balance:

\[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

Therefore, the new balance on her credit card is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the total number of jellyfish in the tank be \( x \).

2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).

3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).

4. According to the problem, 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{15} = 6
   \]

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 6 \times 15

"If 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can find the total school population by setting up the equation:

40% of total population = 240 boys

First, convert 40% to a decimal:
40% = 0.40

Now, set up the equation:
0.40 * total population = 240

To find the total population, divide both sides by 0.40:
total population = 240 / 0.40
total population = 600

Now, to find the number of girls, subtract the number of boys from the total population:
number of girls = total population - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in June.
2. Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike each day.
3. Calculate the total number of miles she will hike in June based on her current plan.
4. Find the difference between her goal and the total miles she will hike with her current plan.
5. Determine how many more miles she needs to hike each day to meet her goal.

Let's go through these steps:

1. June has 30 days.
2. Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which totals:
   \[
   125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles per day}
   \]
3. The total number of miles she will hike in June with her current plan is:
   \[
   250 \text{ miles per day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles}
   \]
4. The difference between her goal and the total miles she will hike with her current plan is:
   \[
   9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles}
   \]
5. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we divide the remaining miles by the number of days in June:
   \[
   \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles per day}
   \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"First, let's determine how many kilograms of apples Pierre and Paul will get.

Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants a third of the 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of apples that Pierre and Paul will take:
\[ \text{Total taken by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

The total amount of apples is 12 kg, so the amount left for Jacques is:

2. Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours.
3. Use the information that 20 toys are still needed to find out how many toys the fifth worker produced in 10 hours.
4. Calculate the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours

- 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each.
  - Total toys produced by these 2 workers in 10 hours: \(2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
- 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each.
  - Total toys produced by these 2 workers in 10 hours: \(2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80\) toys.

Total toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours:
\[ 120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys} \]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours

The manufacturer still needs 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. The remaining stickers are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).
6. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16

"To find out how old Vince is now, let's start by determining Liam's age two years ago. 

Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, he was:
16 - 2 = 14 years old.

According to the problem, two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince. So, if we let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago, we can write the equation:
14 = 2V

To find \( V \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
V = 14 / 2
V = 7

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
7 + 2 = 9

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Eggs Painted:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.

2. **Eggs Painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   - Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

3. **Eggs Painted by Arnold and Madeline:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Since the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, Arnold and Madeline together painted:
     \[
     56 - 30 = 26 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, each of them painted:
     \[
     \frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ eggs}
     \]

4. **Eggs Painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - Together, they painted 30 eggs:
     \[
     S + (S + 12) = 30
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     2S + 12 = 30
     \]
   - Subtract 12 from both sides:
     \[
     2S = 18
     \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[
     S = 9
     \]
   - So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted:
     \[
     9 + 12 = 21 \text{ eggs}
     \]

5. **Difference in Eggs Painted by Camden and Arnold:**
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     21 - 13 = 8
     \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

25 boxes × 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Now, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:

200 crayons × 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Adding the weight of the boxes and the crayons together:

200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

400 ounces ÷ 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

1. **Determine Grandma's speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

2. **Determine Grandma's speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * 0.05 miles per minute = 0.1 miles per minute.

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Distance on the sidewalk = 1 mile.
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes.

"First, let's figure out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is 24 marbles, we can set up the equation:

Initial marbles + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

60 - 24 = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, we subtract 10 from his initial number of marbles:

36 - 10 = 26

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that would allow Donny to drink the mixed water.

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Mug 1: 33 degrees, 4 ounces poured into the water bottle.
   - Mug 2: Unknown temperature \( T \), 1 ounce poured into the water bottle.

2. **Mixing the Water:**
   - Total volume of water in the water bottle: 4 ounces + 1 ounce = 5 ounces.
   - The temperature of the mixed water must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink it.

3. **Temperature Calculation:**
   - The temperature of the mixed water can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs.
   - The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixed water is:
     \[
     T_f = \frac{(4 \text{ ounces} \times 33 \text{ degrees}) + (1 \text{ ounce} \times T)}{5 \text{ ounces}}
     \]

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - We need \( T_f \) to be at least 40 degrees:
     \[
     \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
     \]

5. **Solving the Inequality:**
   - First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):
     \[
     4 \times 33 = 132
     \]
   - Substitute this into the inequality:
     \[
     \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the denominator:
     \[
     132 + T \geq 200
     \]
   - Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):
     \[
     T \geq 68
     \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

"First, let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes to make \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, so we can set up a proportion to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops.

\[
\frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ potatoes}

   - Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 3 \times 50 = 150 \) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 7 \times 50 = 350 \) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - First, we need to find the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree.

5. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 20 \times 50 = 1000 \) fruits.

6. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) fruits.

7. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   B + 4B + B + 7 = 37
   \]
   \[
   6B + 7 = 37
   \]
6. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   6B = 30
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   B = 5
   \]
8. Now, the length of the red rope is \( 4B \):
   \[
   4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let the amount each gave to their little sister be \( x \) dollars.
   - After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. So, \( 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \)
   - \( 15 - x = 12 \)
   - \( x = 15 - 12 \)
   - \( x = 3 \)

4. **Amount Left in Ronnie's Money:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5.
   - After giving \( x = 3 \) dollars to their little sister, Ronnie is left with \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) dollars.

So, the amount left in Ronnie's money is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - The regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods you can get for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, for $1, you can get \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Calculate the number of dishwashing cycles you can run with 10 pods:**

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing 10 Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the remaining money.
   \[
   \text{Remaining money in $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200

"On Monday, the teacher used 45% of a 5-inch piece of chalk. This means he used \(5 \times 0.45 = 2.25\) inches of chalk. 

The remaining length of the chalk after Monday is:
\[5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}\]

The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day. We need to determine how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches.

Let's calculate the length of the chalk each day:

**Day 1 (Tuesday):**
\[2.75 \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches used}\]
\[2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \text{ inches remaining}\]

**Day 2 (Wednesday):**

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate how many boys and girls are on varsity.

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity:
1/3 * 12 = 4 girls are on varsity.

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity:
1/4 * 12 = 3 boys are on varsity.

Now, we add the number of boys and girls on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students are on varsity.

The total number of students in the class is:
12 girls + 12 boys = 24 students.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
24 students - 7 students = 17 students are not on varsity.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3}
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To figure out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of making snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in 1 hour.

2. **Rate of melting snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - In 1 hour, there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes, so 2 snowballs * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in 1 hour.

3. **Net rate of snowball accumulation:**
   - In 1 hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs but 8 melt, so the net number of snowballs he gains in 1 hour is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs.

4. **Time to reach 60 snowballs:**
   - To find out how long it will take to have 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of snowball accumulation.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \( x - 38 \) bandages left.
   - After ordering one bulk pack, they had \( x - 38 + 50 \) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \( (x - 38 + 50) - 28 \) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \( 50 / 2 = 25 \) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \( ((x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100) - 25 \) bandages left.

4. **Final Condition:**
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.
   - Therefore, we set up the equation:
     \[
     ((x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100) - 25 = 78
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify inside the parentheses:
     \[
     (x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100) - 25 = 78
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     (x + 84) - 25 = 78

   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 78 - 59

"To find out how many pens Alain has, we need to calculate the total number of red and black pens.

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens:
   \[
   5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
   \]

2. She also bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. So, the number of packs of black pens is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs}
   \]
   Since each pack has 5 pens:
   \[
   10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens}
   \]

3. The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of the red and black pens:
   \[
   25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens}
   \]

So, the final answer is:

"First, let's find the cost per bottle of scotch:
- John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600.
- Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 / 10 = $60.

Next, let's determine the number of bottles of cognac:
- John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.
- Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * 10 = 20.

Now, let's find the cost per bottle of cognac:
- Cognac costs 50% more per bottle than scotch.
- Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + (0.5 * $60) = $60 + $30 = $90.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cognac:
- Total cost of cognac = 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1800.

Finally, let's find the total amount John spends on everything:
- Total cost = Cost of scotch + Cost of cognac = $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ Lodgepole Pine trees} \]

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees planted on the second day is:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ White Oak trees} \]

For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than he did on the first day. So, the number of additional Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is:

\[ 40 \times \frac{1}{4} = 10 \text{ more Lodgepole Pine trees} \]

Therefore, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is:

\[ 40 + 10 = 50 \text{ Lodgepole Pine trees} \]

Now, let's add up all the trees planted over the two days:

- Total White Oak trees: \( 20 + 30 = 50 \)

   - Cost of honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

   Total cost for one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

2. **Calculate the total cost for 10 jars:**
   - Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:**
   - Revenue from selling 10 jars = 10 * $50 = $500

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $500 - $440 = $60

"First, let's figure out how many holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

9 holes/day - 6 holes/night = 3 holes/day

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Test Tubes:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes.
   - Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested.
   - Half of 16 is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.

2. **Petri Dishes:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes.
   - Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.
   - Two more than 14 is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.

3. **Beakers:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers.
   - Igor gathered the correct number of beakers but lost some.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost.
   - Therefore, the number of beakers Igor placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

4. **Total Items:**
   - The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29.
   - The total number of items is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes.
   - So, \( 8 + (7 - x) + 16 = 29 \).

Now, let's solve the equation:

\[
8 + (7 - x) + 16 = 29
\]

Combine the constants:

\[
8 + 7 + 16 - x = 29
\]

\[
31 - x = 29
\]

Subtract 31 from both sides:

\[
-x = 29 - 31
\]

\[
-x = -2
\]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[
x = 2
\]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she ran twice as far as Aaron.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - So, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times 8 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Vanessa's speed is 16 minutes per mile.
   - For 4 miles, the time taken is \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the watermelons.
2. Determine the total selling price with the profit.
3. Divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons to find the price per watermelon.

Step 1: The total cost of the watermelons is $80.

Step 2: The profit is 25% of the total cost. So, we calculate the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

The total selling price is the total cost plus the profit:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Step 3: To find the price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( C \) be the number of chickens.
2. Let \( K \) be the number of cows.

We know the following:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve for \( C \) and \( K \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.
