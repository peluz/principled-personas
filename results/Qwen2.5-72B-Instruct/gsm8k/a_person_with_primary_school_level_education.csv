"To find out how many bolts in total it takes to make a robe, we need to add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber together.

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. It takes half that much white fiber, which means it takes \(2 \div 2 = 1\) bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \]

So, the total number of bolts it takes to make a robe is 3.

"To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's find the new value of the house. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

150% of $80,000 is calculated as:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the value of the house increased by $120,000. Adding this to the original purchase price:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

The new value of the house is $200,000.

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ 70,000 \]

"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he does each time by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by how many times he does this in a week.

James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, for each session, he runs:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

He does this 3 times a week, so the total distance he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed Wendi gives her chickens each day.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed.

First, we know that each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day. Wendi has 20 chickens, so the total daily feed is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we add the feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups (morning)} + 25 \text{ cups (afternoon)} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed to find out how much is needed for the final meal:
\[ 60 \text{ cups (total daily feed)} - 40 \text{ cups (morning and afternoon)} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses considering the discount on every second glass.

1. The cost of one glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 16 glasses:
- For 16 glasses, there will be 8 pairs of glasses.
- In each pair, the first glass costs $5 and the second glass costs $3.

So, the cost for one pair of glasses is $5 + $3 = $8.
The cost for 8 pairs of glasses is 8 * $8 = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

64"
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: We know Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, Charleston has:
   \[
   4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ sheep}
   \]
3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, Toulouse has:
   \[
   2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ sheep}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total number of sheep in all three cities:
\[
20 + 80 + 160 = 260
\]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute.
   - Time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Add the time for the Windows update:**
   - The Windows update takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time to download the file from the beginning again:**
   - The entire file is 200 GB.
   - Time to download 200 GB is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \) minutes.

4. **Add all the times together:**
   - Time to download 40% of the file: 40 minutes
   - Time for the Windows update: 20 minutes
   - Time to download the entire file again: 100 minutes
   - Total time: \( 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 \) minutes

"First, let's figure out how far John drives initially.

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

So, John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.

Now, let's calculate how far he travels back home in the 4 hours.

1. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.
2. For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles} \]
3. For the remaining 1.5 hours (since 4 hours - 2.5 hours = 1.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph:
\[ 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the distances he covers while driving back:
\[ 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 135 \text{ miles} \]

John was 180 miles away from home initially, and he has covered 135 miles back home. So, the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours is:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} - 135 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

"To find out how much Eliza earned this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and then her earnings for the 5 hours of overtime.

1. Calculate the earnings for the first 40 hours:
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - For 40 hours, her earnings are 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. Calculate the earnings for the 5 hours of overtime:
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.
   - For 5 hours of overtime, her earnings are 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. Add the earnings from the regular hours and the overtime hours to get the total earnings for the week:
   - Total earnings = $400 (regular) + $60 (overtime) = $460.

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then add them together.

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times as many as the first month.
   - So, the downloads in the second month = 3 * 60 = 180.

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - 30% of 180 = 0.30 * 180 = 54.
   - So, the downloads in the third month = 180 - 54 = 126.

4. **Total Downloads:**
   - Total downloads over the three months = 60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366.

"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

1. **Cost of donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Cost of mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Cost of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add the costs of all the pastries together to get the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"To figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total earnings over the years.

1. **Initial Cost to Plant the Tree:** $90
2. **Annual Cost to Water and Feed the Tree:** $3
3. **Annual Earnings from Selling Lemons:** 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

Each year, Carlos's net profit (earnings minus costs) is:
$10.5 (earnings) - $3 (costs) = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial planting cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the annual net profit:
$90 / $7.5 = 12 years

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. Let's say Melanie started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
3. After selling at the green house, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.
6. After selling at the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
7. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:

20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the 4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance are accounted for:

20 - 4 = 16 students

Now, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

This leaves us with the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance:

16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we calculate:

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To find out which option will give the merchant more profit, we need to calculate the profit from each option.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Initial cost: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Profit from jewelry = 2.5% of $5,000
   - Profit from jewelry = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Initial cost: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = 1.2% of $8,000
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Now, we compare the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

The maximum profit the merchant can make is $125.

"To find the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled each day.

1. On the first day, each train travels 80 miles westward.
2. On the next day, each train travels 150 miles northward.

Now, we add these two distances together:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
230 miles"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both jobs and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She teaches for 35 hours a week.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- So, her weekly earnings from teaching are 35 hours * $20/hour = $700.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from being a cheerleading coach:
- She coaches for 15 hours a week.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- So, her weekly earnings from coaching are 15 hours * $30/hour = $450.

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching
- Total weekly earnings = $700 + $450 = $1150.

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual salary is:
- Annual salary = Total weekly earnings * Number of weeks
- Annual salary = $1150 * 50 = $57,500.

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses in one day:**
   Claire makes a 3 egg omelet each morning.

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses in one week:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so:
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks:**
   There are 4 weeks, so:
   \[
   21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:**
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
   \[
   \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens}
   \]

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"To find out the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail to have an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Already Taken} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = \text{Total Distance} - \text{Distance Already Walked} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"First, let's figure out how much water is in the orange drink and the pineapple drink.

For the orange drink:
- The orange drink is 10 liters, but 1 liter is spilled, so we have 9 liters left.
- Two-thirds of the orange drink is water.
- So, the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) liters.

For the pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is 15 liters.
- Three-fifths of the pineapple drink is water.
- So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks:
- Total water = water from orange drink + water from pineapple drink
- Total water = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters

So, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of mixed drink is 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born.

First, we know Samantha is 31 years old now and Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha. So, Raymond's current age is:
31 + 6 = 37 years old.

Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago this was, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:
37 - 23 = 14 years ago.

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we can break down the sales by the number of customers and the DVDs they bought:

- The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so that's 3 customers * 1 DVD/customer = 3 DVDs.
- The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 customers * 2 DVDs/customer = 4 DVDs.
- The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so that's 3 customers * 0 DVDs/customer = 0 DVDs.

Now, we add up all the DVDs sold:
3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 0 DVDs = 7 DVDs

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time the candle burns.
2. Determine how much the candle melts in that time.

First, let's find out how long the candle burns:
- The candle starts burning at 1:00 PM and stops at 5:00 PM.
- The time difference between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Next, we know the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. So, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:
- 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid, $19.50, is 75% of the original price because he got a 25% discount. 

Let's call the original price \( P \).

Since $19.50 is 75% of \( P \), we can write the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"First, let's find out how much Marie spent on the chicken meal, milk, and apples.

- The chicken meal costs $12.
- 5 packs of milk at $3 each would be 5 * $3 = $15.
- 4 apples at $1.50 each would be 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
$12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50. To find out how much she spent on pizza, we subtract the total cost of the other items from $50:
$50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie bought, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will eat in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

Step 1: Total servings in 60 days
Cynthia eats 1 serving per day, so in 60 days, she will eat:
1 serving/day * 60 days = 60 servings

Step 2: Number of cartons needed
Each carton has 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will need is:
60 servings / 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons

Step 3: Total cost
Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to look at the distances mentioned:

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip, which means he stopped at the 45-mile mark (60 - 15 = 45).

Now, to find the distance between the first and second stops, we subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop:

45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"To find out how much the boots cost, we need to first figure out the total cost of the two pairs of high heels.

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so:
\[ 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Now, we add the costs of the two pairs of heels together:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

The two pairs of heels together cost $99, and this is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. So, we add $5 to the total cost of the heels to find the cost of the boots:
\[ 99 + 5 = 104 \]

Therefore, the boots cost:

"To find out Allen's age 10 years from now, we first need to figure out their current ages based on the ratio and the total age given.

1. The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means for every 7 years Darrell is, Allen is 11 years.
2. The total of their ages is 162 years.
3. We can represent their ages as 7x and 11x, where x is a common multiplier.
4. The sum of their ages is 7x + 11x = 162.
5. This simplifies to 18x = 162.
6. Solving for x, we get x = 162 / 18 = 9.
7. Therefore, Darrell's current age is 7x = 7 * 9 = 63 years.
8. Allen's current age is 11x = 11 * 9 = 99 years.
9. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the guesses made by Gunter's friends.
2. Calculate the total of these guesses.
3. Divide the total by the number of guesses to find the average.

First, let's list the guesses:
- The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
- The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 80 plus 20 is 100.

So, the guesses are:
- First friend: 80
- Second friend: 60
- Third friend: 100

Next, we add these guesses together:
80 + 60 + 100 = 240

Now, we divide the total by the number of guesses (which is 3) to find the average:
240 ÷ 3 = 80

The average guess is 80.

"To find out how many gold coins Gretchen has, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given.

Let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).

The total number of coins is 110, which is the sum of the silver and gold coins:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 40 \]

So, the number of silver coins is 40. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
\[ 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins is 70.

"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, and Raymond has 40 jewels, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20 jewels

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25 jewels

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts he needs to buy to have enough for 30 days.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets he needs to buy.

Step 1: Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Since yogurts are sold in sets of 4, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts he needs to buy to have 60 yogurts:
60 yogurts / 4 yogurts/set = 15 sets

Step 3: Each set costs $5.00, so the total cost for 15 sets is:
15 sets * $5.00/set = $75.00

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running, and then divide the distance by the time to get his speed.

1. **Total Distance**: John runs 60 miles a week.

2. **Total Time**:
   - On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
   - On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.
   - Total time for the other two days: 1.5 hours/day * 2 days = 3 hours.
   - Total time for the week: 3 hours (first day) + 3 hours (other two days) = 6 hours.

3. **Speed**:
   - Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
   - Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, running speed = 3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running speed is four times faster than walking speed.
   - Therefore, walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time = 6 hours.
   - Time spent running = 1/3 of 6 hours = 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours.
   - Time spent walking = 2/3 of 6 hours = 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running = running speed * time running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking = walking speed * time walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = distance running + distance walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final numerical answer is:
18 miles."

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how far Polly can throw the gold javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone.

1. First, we know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
2. When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. So, we multiply 400 feet by 3:
   \[
   400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:
   \[
   1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"First, let's figure out how many calories are in the whole bag of chips. Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag and each serving has 250 calories, we multiply 250 by 5:

250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories

Now, let's see how many calories you have left for the day. If your daily target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, then:

2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories left

Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips you can eat with the 200 calories you have left. Since the whole bag (300g) has 1250 calories, we can find out how many calories are in 1 gram of chips:

1250 calories / 300g = 4.1667 calories/gram

Now, we can find out how many grams of chips you can eat with 200 calories:

200 calories / 4.1667 calories/gram = 48 grams

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday:**
   - On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
   - On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.
   - \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 5 articles is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2 \) articles.
   - Therefore, on Tuesday, she wrote \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.

2. **Calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   - Twice 7 articles is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

3. **Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:**

"First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per tie:
\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so:
\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we calculate the total amount spent on red ties:
\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. **Emeralds**: There are twice the number of emeralds as rubies. So, the number of emeralds is:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, we add the number of each type of gem to find the total number of gems:
\[
175 + 140 + 280 = 595
\]

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 595.

"First, we need to find out how many boys there are. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Next, we need to find the total number of students. This is the sum of the number of boys and girls:
Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Now, we know there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 5:
Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

"To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes by multiplying the total number of students by the amount she charges per student.

First, let's find the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week:
- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), she teaches 5 classes each day. So, for 5 days, that's 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.
- Total classes in a week = 25 classes (weekdays) + 8 classes (Saturday) = 33 classes.

Next, let's find the total number of students she teaches in a week:
- Each class has 15 students.
- Total students in a week = 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money she makes:
- She charges $15.00 per student.
- Total money made in a week = 495 students * $15.00/student = $7,425.00.

So, Judy makes $7,425.00 in one week.

"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the money from the brownies and the cheesecakes separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the money from the brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie for $3.
- He sells 43 brownies.
- So, the money from brownies is \( 43 \times 3 = 129 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the money from the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each slice of cheesecake for $4.
- He sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- So, the money from cheesecakes is \( 23 \times 4 = 92 \) dollars.

Now, we add the money from the brownies and the cheesecakes together:
- Total money raised is \( 129 + 92 = 221 \) dollars.

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for all the cell phones.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid.
4. Divide the total amount to be paid by the number of months (3) to find the monthly payment.

Step 1: Total cost of the cell phones without interest
- Cost per phone: $150
- Number of phones: 5
- Total cost = $150 × 5 = $750

Step 2: Total interest for all the cell phones
- Interest rate: 2%
- Total interest = 2% of $750 = 0.02 × $750 = $15

Step 3: Total amount to be paid
- Total amount = Total cost + Total interest = $750 + $15 = $765

Step 4: Monthly payment
- Number of months: 3
- Monthly payment = Total amount ÷ Number of months = $765 ÷ 3 = $255

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we need to first determine the square footage of each level and then calculate the average.

1. The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16.
2. The 3rd level will have twice the square footage of the 4th level: \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \).
3. The 2nd level will have twice the square footage of the 3rd level: \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \).
4. The 1st level will have twice the square footage of the 2nd level: \( 64 \times 2 = 128 \).

Now, we add up the square footage of all the levels:
\[ 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year and then determine how many bags of dog food she will need.

1. Calculate the amount of dog food used in the first 180 days:
   - The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - For 180 days, the puppy will eat: 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

2. Calculate the amount of dog food used in the remaining days of the first year:
   - A year has 365 days.
   - The remaining days after the first 180 days are: 365 days - 180 days = 185 days.
   - The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for these remaining days.
   - For 185 days, the puppy will eat: 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

3. Calculate the total amount of dog food used in the first year:
   - Total dog food = 180 cups (first 180 days) + 370 cups (remaining 185 days) = 550 cups.

4. Determine how many bags of dog food are needed:
   - Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = Total dog food / Cups per bag = 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

5

So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"First, we need to find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can write:

Sarah's laundry = 4 * David's laundry

We know Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so:

400 = 4 * David's laundry

To find David's laundry, we divide both sides by 4:

David's laundry = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so:

Raymond's laundry = 1/2 * Sarah's laundry

Raymond's laundry = 1/2 * 400 = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100 = 100 pounds

"To find out how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 and in packages of 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 3 = 6 packages.
- The total cost for 6 packages is 6 * $2.50 = $15.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.00.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 2 = 9 packages.
- The total cost for 9 packages is 9 * $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, we compare the two total costs:
- The cost for packages of 3 is $15.00.
- The cost for packages of 2 is $9.00.

The amount saved by buying the flowers in packages of 2 is:
$15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

So, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"First, we need to find out how much the discount is. The discount is 30% of $100. 

To find 30% of $100, we multiply $100 by 30% (or 0.30):
\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

So, the discount is $30.

Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final cost:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

The grooming cost is $70.

"First, let's find out how much water the two girls got together. Each girl got 1/6 of 24 liters, so:

1/6 of 24 liters = 24 liters / 6 = 4 liters per girl

Since there are two girls, they got:

4 liters/girl * 2 girls = 8 liters

Now, the boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:

8 liters (girls) + 6 liters (boy) = 14 liters

The total amount of water was 24 liters, so the amount of water left is:

24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters

"First, we need to find out how much Alex weighs. We know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. 

Grace's weight is 125 pounds. So, 4 times Grace's weight is:
4 * 125 = 500 pounds

Now, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than this, so:
500 - 2 = 498 pounds

Next, we add Grace's and Alex's weights together to find their combined weight:
125 + 498 = 623 pounds

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say the number of games the team lost is \( L \).
2. According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost. So, the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).
3. The total number of games played is 22. This means the sum of the games they won and the games they lost is 22. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   L + (L + 8) = 22
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2L + 8 = 22
   \]
5. Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):
   \[
   2L = 14
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( L \):
   \[
   L = 7
   \]
7. Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:
   \[
   L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15
   \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To find out how many quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the total number of vacations he has been on. 

First, we find out how many years he has been going on vacations:
- Gene is now 34 years old.
- He started going on vacations when he was 23 years old.
- So, the number of years he has been going on vacations is \(34 - 23 = 11\) years.

Next, we know he goes on 4 vacations each year. So, the total number of vacations (which is the same as the number of quilt blocks) is:
- \(11 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ vacations/year} = 44\) vacations.

Therefore, Gene has 44 quilt blocks in total.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Monthly Salary**: Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.
2. **Initial Annual Salary**: To find the initial annual salary, we multiply the monthly salary by 12 (months in a year):
   \[
   600 \times 12 = 7200
   \]
3. **Salary Increase After 5 Years**: Since Sylvie has completed 5 years, her salary will increase by 10% of the initial salary. The increase is:
   \[
   600 \times 0.10 = 60
   \]
   So, her new monthly salary after 5 years is:
   \[
   600 + 60 = 660
   \]
4. **New Annual Salary After 5 Years**: To find the new annual salary after 5 years, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12:
   \[
   660 \times 12 = 7920
   \]
5. **Salary After 3 More Years**: Since the salary increase policy only applies once after 5 years, Sylvie's salary will remain the same for the next 3 years. Therefore, her annual salary after 3 more years will still be:
   \[
   7920
   \]

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is:
\[
7920

"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we can set up a simple equation. Let's say Harald sold \( H \) copies. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is 88,000, so we can write the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]
\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

   - So, 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs.

2. Calculate how much potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
   - Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs.
   - There are 5 children.
   - So, 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs.

3. Add the amounts for adults and children to get the total:

"First, we need to find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles before he changed his diet. We know that Lee used to be two seconds faster than Gerald. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, Gerald used to run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. If his speed improved by 10%, his time would decrease by 10%. To find the new time, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds and subtract it from 40 seconds.

10% of 40 seconds is 0.10 * 40 = 4 seconds.

So, Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   - We know there are two cats for every dog.
   - The number of dogs is 60.
   - Therefore, the number of cats is \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \).

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is 60.
   - The number of cats is 120.
   - Combined, the number of dogs and cats is \( 60 + 120 = 180 \).

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - Therefore, the number of rabbits is \( 180 - 12 = 168 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The number of dogs is 60.
   - The number of cats is 120.
   - The number of rabbits is 168.

The rest of the students are girls. So, the number of girls is:
200 - 80 = 120 girls

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
120 * 2/3 = 80 girls

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used.
3. Find out how many tomatoes were in those cans.

First, since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked into sauce, the original volume of tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so the original volume of tomatoes was:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces. We do this by dividing the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
\[ 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/can} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then find the volume of one box. After that, we can multiply by 3 to get the total volume for all 3 boxes.

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Volume = length × width × height
   - Volume of one box = \( 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total volume = volume of one box × number of boxes
   - Total volume = \( 24 \times 3 = 72 \) cubic inches

"Let's break down the total TV watching time by each day:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: We need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched.
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

First, let's add up the hours we know:
1 (Monday) + 1 (Tuesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours (total) - 5.5 hours (known) = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes make up 1.5 hours:
1.5 hours = 90 minutes
90 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Henry ends up with 110 cookies after dropping 5. So, before dropping the cookies, he had:
   \[
   110 + 5 = 115 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. Henry baked 15 more cookies than he intended to. So, the number of cookies he intended to bake is:
   \[
   115 - 15 = 100 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. Henry intended to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. So, the number of cookies he baked last year is:
   \[
   \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ cookies}
   \]

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"First, we need to find out how much the gas costs before the cashback. If the gas is $3.00 per gallon and someone buys 10 gallons, we multiply 3 by 10:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]
So, the cost of the gas before cashback is $30.00.

Next, we calculate the cashback. The app company offers $0.20 cashback per gallon. For 10 gallons, the total cashback is:
\[ 0.20 \times 10 = 2 \]
So, the total cashback is $2.00.

Now, we subtract the cashback from the total cost of the gas:
\[ 30 - 2 = 28 \]
So, the final cost of the gas after the cashback is $28.00.

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate.

For Beatrice:
- Her roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of roll-ups she ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- His roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of roll-ups he ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we add the total number of roll-ups they both ate:
- Total roll-ups = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average = \(90 \div 2 = 45\).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total distance Julia rowed:**
   - Julia took 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - The shore was 64 seconds away.
   - To find the total distance, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water taken on:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - For 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:
     \[
     \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
     \]

So, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore.

"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of lessons in a day. Since there are 4 teachers and each teacher has 2 lessons, we multiply the number of teachers by the number of lessons each teacher has:
   \[
   4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons/teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons/day}
   \]

2. Each lesson involves cleaning the whiteboard 3 times. So, to find the total number of cleanings in a day, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson:
   \[
   8 \text{ lessons/day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings/day}

"First, let's figure out how much Sasha originally paid for all the lumber.

For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Total cost for all the lumber:
$100 + $80 = $180

Now, let's calculate the new selling price for each type of board after the 50% price increase.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
Original price = $10
50% increase = $10 * 0.50 = $5
New price = $10 + $5 = $15

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
Original price = $16
50% increase = $16 * 0.50 = $8
New price = $16 + $8 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total selling price for all the boards.

For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
10 boards * $15 per board = $150

For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
5 boards * $24 per board = $120

Total selling price for all the boards:
$150 + $120 = $270

Finally, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total selling price.

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $270 - $180 = $90

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio of sugar to water that Katy uses, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

First, let's find the total number of parts in the ratio:
7 (sugar) + 13 (water) = 20 parts

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. We need to find out how many of these 120 parts are sugar.

Since the total parts in the ratio is 20, we can find out how many units each part represents by dividing the total amount by the total number of parts:
120 / 20 = 6 units per part

Now, we need to find out how many units of sugar there are:
7 parts (sugar) * 6 units per part = 42 units of sugar

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"First, let's find out what Lylah's salary was four years ago. If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, we can set up the equation to find Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 30\% \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = \text{Lylah's salary} \times 1.30 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. His salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 40\% \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we need to find out Lylah's salary four years later. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 40\% \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add both of their new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = \text{Adrien's new salary} + \text{Lylah's new salary} \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

"Let's figure this out step by step:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons. We don't know how many spoons were in this package yet, so let's call this number \( x \).

2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.

3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew, so these 3 spoons are not available for setting the table.

4. When Julia set the table, she had 12 spoons left.

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before setting the table is the number of spoons she bought plus the 5 spoons her husband bought, minus the 3 spoons she used for tasting. This can be written as:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is 10.

"First, we need to figure out how many hours Jordan would work in a week if he spent his video game time working. Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so:

2 hours/day × 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Next, we need to calculate how much money Jordan would earn if he worked these 14 hours at his part-time job, where he earns $10 an hour:

14 hours/week × $10/hour = $140/week

So, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

"First, let's add up the cost of all the items John bought:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of all items: $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we need to identify which items are nonfood items and calculate the tax on them. The nonfood items are:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

The tax on the nonfood items is 10%, so we calculate the tax as follows:
10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of all items:
Total cost including tax: $15 + $1 = $16

"First, let's figure out the total number of clients Kim will have:
- Current clients: 3
- Potential clients: 5
- Total clients: 3 + 5 = 8

Next, we calculate the total expenses for each client:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- Cost of 2 bottles of bleach: 2 * $2 = $4
- Cost of 1 pack of cloths: $5
- Total cost per client: $4 + $5 = $9

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:
- Total clients: 8
- Total cost per client: $9
- Total expenses: 8 * $9 = $72

Kim's total income each week is $92.

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
- Total income: $92
- Total expenses: $72
- Profit: $92 - $72 = $20

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples John has in his field at one time.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest in a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year.

Step 1: Total number of pineapples in the field
John has 10 hectares of land, and each hectare has 100 pineapples.
So, \( 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \).

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
John can harvest every 3 months. There are 12 months in a year.
So, \( 12 \text{ months/year} \div 3 \text{ months/harvest} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \).

Step 3: Total number of pineapples harvested in a year
Now, multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year.
So, \( 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \).

"To find out how many blocks Johnny picks up, we need to add up the pieces from all the Lego sets he dumped on the floor.

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, so it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we add all the pieces together:
\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up 2125 blocks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Bees leaving in the first 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return as she saw leave in the first 6 hours.
   - Half of 30 is 15.
   - So, 15 bees return.

3. **Bees leaving in the next 6 hours:**
   - She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive.
   - Two times 30 is 60.
   - So, 60 bees leave.

4. **Bees returning in the last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left and didn't return: 30 (first group) + 60 (second group) = 90 bees.
   - Bees that already returned: 15 bees.
   - Bees that need to return: 90 - 15 = 75 bees.

So, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to add the cost of one adult ticket and one child ticket, and then add the change she received back to this total.

The cost of one adult ticket is $12.
The cost of one child ticket is $10.

So, the total cost for the tickets is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

She received $8 in change, which means the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Therefore, the amount of money she gave the cashier is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference in their travel times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

- Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
- Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Now, we find the difference in their travel times to determine how long the winner will be waiting.

- Difference in time: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost for inflating all the tires.

1. Bicycles have 2 tires. If 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, that's 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.
2. Tricycles have 3 tires. If 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, that's 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires.
3. A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by on a unicycle, that's 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle = 1 tire.

Now, we add up all the tires: 10 tires (bicycles) + 9 tires (tricycles) + 1 tire (unicycle) = 20 tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. So, 20 tires * 25 cents/tire = 500 cents.

Since 100 cents make a dollar, 500 cents / 100 cents/dollar = 5 dollars.

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Dave's fries**: Dave ate 14 fries.
2. **Seagull's fries**: The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, so the seagull ate \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries.
3. **Pigeons' fries**: Each of the three pigeons ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries.
4. **Fries left after pigeons**: Let's call the total number of fries \(x\). After Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons, the number of fries left is \(x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 30\).
5. **Raccoon's fries**: The raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so the raccoon ate \(\frac{2}{3} \times (x - 30)\). The number of fries left after the raccoon is \(\frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30)\).
6. **Ants' fries**: The ants carried off 1 fry, so the number of fries left is \(\frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) - 1\).
7. **Fries left**: According to the problem, 5 fries were left. So, \(\frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) - 1 = 5\).

Now, let's solve the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) = 6
\]
Multiply both sides by 3:
\[
x - 30 = 18
\]
Add 30 to both sides:
\[
x = 48
\]

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 48.

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total hours he spends in class each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the total hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
- So, each of these days, he spends 3 hours in class.
- There are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).

Total hours on these days in a week:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
- So, each of these days, he spends 4 hours in class.
- There are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday).

Total hours on these days in a week:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, let's add the hours from all the days to get the total hours Kimo spends in class each week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Finally, to find the total hours Kimo spends in class in one semester, we multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks in the semester:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

"To find out how long all the baked goods will be when put end to end, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert all measurements to feet since the final answer needs to be in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - 4 inches is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Total length of rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - 6 inches is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants.
   - Total length of croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Total length of baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Now, we add the total lengths of all the baked goods together:
- Total length = Length of rolls + Length of croissants + Length of baguettes
- Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet
- Total length = 280 feet

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet.

"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas all the apes need in one month. 

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

First, we add these amounts together to find the total number of bananas needed per month:
200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to multiply the monthly total by 2:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

   - Each back and forth run is 200 yards (100 yards there and 100 yards back).
   - Total distance Blake runs: \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

2. **Kelly's Distance:**
   - Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
   - Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
   - The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards there and 40 yards back).
   - Total distance for the 40-yard line runs: \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
   - Adding the initial 100-yard run: \( 2720 + 100 = 2820 \) yards.

3. **Difference in Distance:**
   - Blake's total distance: 3000 yards.
   - Kelly's total distance: 2820 yards.

"To find out how much a bag of marbles would cost after 36 months with a 20% increase every two months, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of price increases**: Since the price increases every two months, we need to find out how many two-month periods are in 36 months.
   \[
   \text{Number of increases} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
   \]

2. **Calculate the new price after each increase**: Each increase is 20% of the original price, which means the price is multiplied by 1.20 (100% + 20%) each time.
   \[
   \text{New price} = \text{Original price} \times (1.20)^{\text{Number of increases}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{New price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}

   - Let's denote the total cost as \( C \).
   - The total revenue \( R \) is the profit plus the total cost: \( R = C + 25 \).

2. **Determine the cost per gallon:**
   - The cost for lemons per gallon is $3.
   - The cost for sugar per gallon is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per gallon is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the revenue per gallon:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, the revenue per gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the number of gallons sold:**
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons sold.
   - The total revenue is \( 10G \).
   - The total cost is \( 5G \).
   - The profit is \( 10G - 5G = 5G \).

5. **Set up the profit equation:**
   - We know the profit is $25.
   - Therefore, \( 5G = 25 \).

6. **Solve for \( G \):**
   - \( G = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) gallons.

7. **Calculate the total cost for lemons:**
   - The cost for lemons per gallon is $3.
   - For 5 gallons, the total cost for lemons is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) dollars.

So, the amount spent on lemons is:

"First, we need to find out how many Chinese people were in the race. We know there were 240 Asians in total and 80 of them were Japanese. So, we subtract the number of Japanese from the total number of Asians:

240 - 80 = 160

This means there were 160 Chinese people in the race. We are told that 60 of these Chinese participants were boys. To find out how many were girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

160 - 60 = 100

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team was 100.

"First, let's find out how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

Zaid's salary is $6000.

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

Now, let's add the rent and car fuel expenses:
\[ 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \]

Next, we find out how much money is left after paying for rent and car fuel:
\[ 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \]

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

After the donation, the amount left is:
\[ 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

Zaid gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700:
\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, the amount left after all expenses and donations is:
\[ 1250 - 900 = 350 \]

"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week:
- Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
- He tutored for 5 hours.
- So, his earnings for the first week are $10 * 5 = $50.

For the second week:
- Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
- He tutored for 8 hours.
- So, his earnings for the second week are $10 * 8 = $80.

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks:
- Total earnings = $50 + $80 = $130.

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the number of white carnations:**
   - Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.
   - Let the number of white carnations be \( C \).
   - Therefore, \( 200 = 5C \).

2. **Solve for \( C \):**
   - \( C = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \).

3. **Determine the number of red roses:**
   - Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
   - The number of red roses is \( 4C \).
   - Since \( C = 40 \), the number of red roses is \( 4 \times 40 = 160 \).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

### Team 1 (Well-Rounded Team):
- Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- Total time for the team = 4 runners × 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

### Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team):
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for the team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

### Difference in Time:
- Time taken by Team 1: 220 seconds
- Time taken by Team 2: 222 seconds
- Difference = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate two probabilities and then compare them.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the difference in probabilities and express it as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
   - The difference in probabilities is \( 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \).
   - To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we use the formula:
     \[
     \left( \frac{0.25}{0.25} \right) \times 100\% = 100\%
     \]

So, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, let's break down the information given:

1. **Total pieces of straw distributed:** 160 pieces
2. **Straw for hamsters:** 10 cages * 5 pieces per hamster = 50 pieces
3. **Straw for rabbits:** 20 pieces
4. **Straw for rats:** 160 pieces (total) - 50 pieces (hamsters) - 20 pieces (rabbits) = 90 pieces

Now, we know that each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. Let's find out how many rats there are in total:

- **Total rats:** 90 pieces / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups:

- **Rats per cage:** 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage

"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest of 2%, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the interest for the first month:**
   - The interest for the first month is 2% of $100.
   - \( 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \)
   - So, after the first month, the total amount is \( 100 + 2 = 102 \).

2. **Calculate the interest for the second month:**
   - The interest for the second month is 2% of $102.
   - \( 102 \times 0.02 = 2.04 \)
   - So, after the second month, the total amount is \( 102 + 2.04 = 104.04 \).

3. **Calculate the interest for the third month:**
   - The interest for the third month is 2% of $104.04.
   - \( 104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808 \)
   - So, after the third month, the total amount is \( 104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208 \).

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict is $106.12.

"To find out how many bags the trader sold, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of Buying Each Bag**: The trader buys each bag for $20.
2. **Transport Cost Per Bag**: It costs $2 to transport each bag.
3. **Total Cost Per Bag**: The total cost for each bag is $20 (buying) + $2 (transport) = $22.
4. **Selling Price Per Bag**: The trader sells each bag for $30.
5. **Profit Per Bag**: The profit made on each bag is $30 (selling price) - $22 (total cost) = $8.
6. **Total Profit**: The trader made a total profit of $400.

To find the number of bags sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total Profit}}{\text{Profit per Bag}} = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

"First, let's find out how much they spent on food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. The tickets cost $20.25, so:

$20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

This is the amount they spent on food.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the rides. They went on 2 rides, each costing $33:

2 rides * $33/ride = $66

Now, let's add up all their expenses:
- Tickets: $20.25
- Food: $15.75
- Rides: $66

Total expenses = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net change in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:

   - Sue had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Number of flamingos taken back and painted white on Saturday morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **Number of pink flamingos left after some were taken back:**
   - After taking back 6 pink flamingos, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).

4. **Number of white flamingos added back:**
   - The 6 pink flamingos that were taken back were painted white and put back.
   - So, there are now 6 white flamingos.

5. **Number of pink flamingos after adding more on Sunday morning:**
   - On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).

6. **Number of white flamingos:**
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

7. **Difference between the number of pink and white flamingos:**
   - The difference is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

So, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher.
2. Calculate the payment from each publisher.
3. Add the payments from both publishers to find the total weekly earnings.

Step 1: Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for each publisher} \]

Step 2: Calculate the payment from each publisher:
- Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, the payment is:
\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]
- Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, the payment is:
\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Step 3: Add the payments from both publishers to find the total weekly earnings:

1. **List the scores**: Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.
2. **Identify the lowest score**: The lowest score among these is 71.
3. **Calculate the sum of the remaining scores**: 
   - Sum of the scores excluding the lowest (71) = 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.
4. **Determine the target average**: Brinley wants an average of 93 after the sixth test.
5. **Set up the equation for the average**: The average of the five highest scores (after the sixth test) should be 93.
   - Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
   - The sum of the five highest scores after the sixth test will be 367 + \( x \).
   - The average of these five scores is \(\frac{367 + x}{5} = 93\).

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - \(\frac{367 + x}{5} = 93\)
   - Multiply both sides by 5: \(367 + x = 465\)
   - Subtract 367 from both sides: \(x = 465 - 367\)
   - \(x = 98\)

Brinley needs to score 98 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - One plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates means 6 plates.
   - Total cost of 6 plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Calculate the cost of one cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups means 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Total cost of 240 cups is $34800.
   - Cost of one cup = $34800 / 240 = $145.

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"First, let's figure out how much money Sara needs in total to buy the jacket and the shoes.

The jacket costs $30.
Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so that's $20 * 2 = $40.

So, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, she needs $60 - $20 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs by what she earns per lawn mowed: $40 / $4 = 10.

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times.

"To solve this problem, let's use some simple math. We need to find out how many red chickens Jerry has.

1. Let's say the number of red chickens is \( R \).
2. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is \( R + 2 \).

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, and each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. So, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of eggs collected:

\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Distribute the 5 in the equation:
   \[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]

2. Combine like terms:
   \[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]

3. Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( R \):
   \[ 8R = 32 \]

4. Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( R \):
   \[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks, which is the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now (in gallons).
   - Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now (in gallons).

2. **Understand the leak rate:**
   - Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
   - 4 minutes ago, each pool had 4 gallons more water than they do now.

3. **Set up the equations:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons).
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

4. **Use the given information:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
     \[
     B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
     \]
   - Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
     \[
     B = 4S
     \]

5. **Solve the equations:**
   - Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
     \[
     4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     4S + 16 = 2S + 32
     \]
   - Subtract \( 2S \) from both sides:
     \[
     2S + 16 = 32
     \]
   - Subtract 16 from both sides:
     \[
     2S = 16
     \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[
     S = 8
     \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to add the cost of the shoes and the belt together. 

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. So, the total cost is:
\[ 320 + 32 = 352 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ 352 \div 8 = 44 \]

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

"First, let's find out how much Janeth needs to pay back in total. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%.

10% of $2000 is calculated as:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, let's calculate how much she will pay in total over 12 months if she pays $165 each month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back to find the remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:

"First, let's find out the current ages of Adrian and Zack based on Harriet's age.

1. Harriet is 21 years old.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
1. Harriet's age in three years:
   \[
   21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
   \]
2. Adrian's age in three years:
   \[

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first figure out how many points each of the other students scored and then subtract their scores from the total points.

1. **Naomi's score**: It's given that Naomi scored 68 points.
2. **Yuri's score**: Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \). Adding 10 to this, Yuri scored \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.
3. **Brianna's score**: Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.

Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find Jojo's score, we subtract the total points scored by the other three students from 251:

"First, let's find out how many Pokemon cards James has in total after losing and buying some cards.

Initially, he has:
- 30 fire type
- 20 grass type
- 40 water type

After losing 8 water type cards, he has:
- 40 - 8 = 32 water type

After buying 14 more grass type cards, he has:
- 20 + 14 = 34 grass type

Now, the total number of cards he has is:
- 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage is 33%.

"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his monthly plan.

1. First, calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his daily calls with his boss:
   - He calls his boss for 15 minutes every day.
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - So, \( 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \).

2. Add the extra minutes he used for calls to other people:
   - He used 300 extra minutes.
   - So, \( 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \).

3. Subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan:
   - His plan is 1000 minutes.
   - So, \( 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \).

Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial fries Griffin had:**
   - Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   - Kyle took 5 fries.
   - Fries left with Griffin: \( 24 - 5 = 19 \)

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   - Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) fries.
   - Fries left with Griffin: \( 19 - 10 = 9 \)

4. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   - Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so Colby took \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) fries.
   - Fries left with Griffin: \( 9 - 2 = 7 \)

5. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   - After all these transactions, Griffin had 27 fries.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.
   - Therefore, \( 7 + x = 27 \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = 27 - 7 \)
   - \( x = 20 \)

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To find out how many fish are in each aquarium, let's follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of snails in each aquarium:**
   - Aquarium 1: 4 snails
   - Aquarium 2: 32 snails

2. **Calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:**
   - Difference = 32 snails - 4 snails = 28 snails

3. **Understand the relationship between the difference in snails and the number of fish:**
   - The difference in snails (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

4. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let \( F \) be the number of fish in each aquarium.
   - Total number of fish in both aquariums = \( 2F \)
   - According to the problem, 28 = 2 * (2F)

5. **Solve for \( F \):**
   - 28 = 4F
   - F = 28 / 4
   - F = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"First, let's figure out how much the makeup artist charges per day. The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and it takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day. So, the cost per day is:

\[ 250 \times 6 = 1500 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much it costs per week. Since the makeup is done 4 times a week, the weekly cost is:

\[ 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \text{ dollars} \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $30,000:

\[ 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid:

\[ 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jean paid:

"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first add up all the expenses Isabelle had for the party. 

The expenses are:
- $12 for cake ingredients
- $43 for birthday presents
- $15 for decorations
- $4 for invitations
- $22 for goodie bags

Let's add these amounts together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

So, the total cost of the party is $96.

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are three people sharing the cost. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ 96 \div 3 = 32 \]

Each person paid $32.

"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the 80 cards had the letter A:

80 * 2/5 = 32 cards

Now, we subtract the cards with A from the total to find out how many cards are left:

80 - 32 = 48 cards

Next, 1/2 of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B:

48 * 1/2 = 24 cards

Subtract the cards with B from the remaining cards to find out how many are left:

48 - 24 = 24 cards

Then, 5/8 of the rest (24 cards) had the letter C:

24 * 5/8 = 15 cards

Finally, subtract the cards with C from the remaining cards to find out how many had the letter D:

24 - 15 = 9 cards

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

"Let's use some simple math to figure this out.

First, we know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam right now. If we say Sam's age is \(S\), then Ruby's age is \(6S\).

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \(6S + 9\) and Sam's age will be \(S + 9\). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can write the equation:

\[6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)\]

Now, let's solve for \(S\):

\[6S + 9 = 3S + 27\]

Subtract \(3S\) from both sides:

\[3S + 9 = 27\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[3S = 18\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[S = 6\]

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter bought 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- So, the total cost for the popsicles is 20 popsicles * $0.25/popsicle = $5.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter bought 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- So, the total cost for the ice cream bars is 4 ice cream bars * $0.50/ice cream bar = $2.00.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
- Total cost = cost of popsicles + cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00.

So, Peter paid a total of $7.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of spots on a mamba:**
   - A cobra has 70 spots.
   - A cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba.
   - Therefore, a mamba has \( \frac{70}{2} = 35 \) spots.

2. **Calculate the total number of spots for all cobras:**
   - There are 40 cobras.
   - Each cobra has 70 spots.
   - Total spots for cobras = \( 40 \times 70 = 2800 \) spots.

3. **Calculate the total number of spots for all mambas:**
   - There are 60 mambas.
   - Each mamba has 35 spots.
   - Total spots for mambas = \( 60 \times 35 = 2100 \) spots.

4. **Calculate the total number of spots for all snakes:**
   - Total spots for all snakes = Total spots for cobras + Total spots for mambas
   - Total spots for all snakes = \( 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \) spots.

5. **Calculate half the number of spots:**
   - Half the number of spots = \( \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \).

So, the final answer is:

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones in the necklace.
2. Subtract the total length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length used by the sterling silver beads.
3. Determine how many sterling silver beads fit into the remaining length.

Step 1: Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones.
Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones, and each gemstone is 1 inch long.
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Step 2: Subtract the total length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace.
The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Step 3: Determine how many sterling silver beads fit into the remaining length.
Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long.
\[ 17 \text{ inches} \div 0.25 \text{ inches/bead} = 68 \text{ beads} \]

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. In the second week, they each doubled their number of stories.

Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories in the second week.
Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories in the second week.
Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories in the second week.

Now, let's add the stories from both weeks for each of them:

Alani's total stories: 20 (first week) + 40 (second week) = 60 stories
Braylen's total stories: 40 (first week) + 80 (second week) = 120 stories
Margot's total stories: 60 (first week) + 120 (second week) = 180 stories

"First, let's figure out how much money Kelly has in total.

- A quarter is worth 25 cents. Kelly has 5 quarters, so:
  5 quarters × 25 cents/quarter = 125 cents

- A dime is worth 10 cents. Kelly has 2 dimes, so:
  2 dimes × 10 cents/dime = 20 cents

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and the dimes to find the total amount of money Kelly has:
125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find out how many rows of 5 stars are on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars each, so:
3 rows × 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars each, so:
2 rows × 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Adding these together gives us the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has 76 stars in total. To find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows, we subtract the number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

Now, to find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5:
40 stars ÷ 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the speed of the car in the slow lane:**
   - The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour.
   - The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed.
   - So, the speed of the car in the slow lane is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles/hour.

2. **Calculate the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles:**
   - Time is calculated using the formula: \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \).
   - For the car in the slow lane, the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles/hour.
   - Therefore, the time taken is \( \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \).

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

Next, we need to find out the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:
Total medals (Ali + Izzy) = Ali's medals + Izzy's medals
Total medals (Ali + Izzy) = 22 + 17
Total medals (Ali + Izzy) = 39

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total medals Ali and Izzy have:
Total medals given out = 10 × Total medals (Ali + Izzy)
Total medals given out = 10 × 39
Total medals given out = 390

"First, let's figure out how long Susan works. She starts at 8 a.m. and ends at 11 a.m., which is 3 hours in total. But she takes a break for half an hour, so she actually works for 2.5 hours.

Now, we need to convert the working hours into minutes because we know she earns money every 10 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2.5 hours is:
2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:
150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the amount she earns per interval:
15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

   - Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he does not get an extra point: 18 points.
   - Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike: 22 points

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily rice consumption:**
   - Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - Each person eats rice twice a day (lunch and dinner).
   - Therefore, each person eats \(0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day}\).

2. **Calculate the total daily rice consumption for 5 people:**
   - If one person eats 0.4 kg of rice per day, then 5 people will eat \(0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 2 \, \text{kg/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total weekly rice consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

"To find out how much John pays a year for the driving service, we need to calculate the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John travels 30 miles to work and 30 miles back each day, so that's 60 miles per day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week, so that's 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.
- He works 50 weeks a year, so that's 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

Next, we calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- He gets charged $2 per mile, so for 15,000 miles, the cost is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800.

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total annual cost:

Theo wants to save $2000, so the total amount he plans to set aside (expenses + savings) is:
$1950 (expenses) + $2000 (savings) = $3950

Theo has $6000, so the amount left for buying gifts is:
$6000 - $3950 = $2050

So, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - Therefore, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - If Noah was 20 years old six years ago, he is now 20 + 6 = 26 years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).
2. According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
3. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. This can be written as:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Now, let's combine the terms on the left side:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} \]

To combine \( 3D \) and \( \frac{D}{2} \), we need a common denominator:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states there are 30 boys in the classroom.

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem also states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys. So, we calculate the number of girls as:
   \[
   \text{Number of Girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of Boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. So, we calculate the number of nongendered children as:
   \[
   \text{Number of Nongendered Children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of Boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   \text{Total Number of Children} = \text{Number of Boys} + \text{Number of Girls} + \text{Number of Nongendered Children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio given and use it to find the number of electric poles.

The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. 

To find the number of electric poles, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio:
\[ \text{Number of electric poles} : \text{Number of electric wires} = 1 : 3 \]

Let's call the number of electric poles \( x \). According to the ratio, we can write:
\[ \frac{x}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply:
\[ 3x = 45 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ x = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is:

1/4 of 40 people = 40 / 4 = 10 people

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's find out how many men left:
25 men - 22 men = 3 men

Since 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men, the rest must have been women:
10 people - 3 men = 7 women

Now, we can find out how many women are left:
15 women - 7 women = 8 women

"First, let's find out how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. Jam has a total of 26 pencils, including 2 loose pencils. So, the pencils in the boxes are:

26 pencils - 2 loose pencils = 24 pencils

Since these 24 pencils are evenly distributed in 3 boxes, we divide 24 by 3 to find out how many pencils are in each box:

24 pencils ÷ 3 boxes = 8 pencils per box

Now, let's find out the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together:

26 pencils (Jam) + 46 pencils (Meg) = 72 pencils

To find out how many boxes they need to store all 72 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

72 pencils ÷ 8 pencils per box = 9 boxes

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool her coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total amount by which the coffee is weakened.

1. **Determine the number of ice cubes needed:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we divide 65 by 13:
     \[
     \frac{65}{13} = 5
     \]
   - So, Shannon uses 5 ice cubes.

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the total weakening is:
     \[
     5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

3. **Add the weakening effect of the cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So now the total number of people on the bus is \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. So the number of people on the bus now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplify the expression: \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

5. We know that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, so \( x + 6 = 20 \).

6. To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: \( x = 20 - 6 \).

7. So, \( x = 14 \).

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"First, we need to find out the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount. Each shirt costs $30, so for 2 shirts, it would be:
\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the discount. The discount is 40%, so we find 40% of $60:
\[ 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Davos paid:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"To find out what percentage more the factory is making per day now compared to when they made tractors, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily earnings when they made tractors.
2. Calculate the daily earnings now that they make silos.
3. Find the difference in daily earnings.
4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the original daily earnings from tractors.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily earnings when they made tractors.**
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.
- Daily earnings from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day.

**Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings now that they make silos.**
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.
- Daily earnings from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day.

**Step 3: Find the difference in daily earnings.**
- Difference in daily earnings = Daily earnings from silos - Daily earnings from tractors
- Difference = $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day.

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase.**
- Percentage increase = (Difference in daily earnings / Original daily earnings from tractors) * 100
- Percentage increase = ($100/day / $1000/day) * 100 = 10%.

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses first and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

1. **Food cost per month**: Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost for food is:
   \[ 25 \times 4 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

2. **Treats cost per month**: Treats cost $20 per month.

3. **Medicine cost per month**: Medicine costs $100 per month.

Now, we add up all the monthly costs:
\[ 100 \text{ (food)} + 20 \text{ (treats)} + 100 \text{ (medicine)} = 220 \text{ dollars per month} \]

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

"First, we need to find out how many plant pots April needs in total. The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. 

To find out how many plant pots are needed for the roses, we multiply the number of plant pots for the daisies by 2:
30 plant pots * 2 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

Now, we add the plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots needed:
30 plant pots + 60 plant pots = 90 plant pots.

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:
100 plant pots - 90 plant pots = 10 plant pots.

So, April has 10 plant pots left over.

"First, let's figure out the total time John spent on his activities.

1. John spends 6 hours boating.
2. He spends half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.
3. He watches 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Adding these up, the total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (shows) = 15 hours.

We know that the 15 hours is 30% of his total vacation time. To find the total time, we set up the equation:
15 = 0.30 * Total Time

To find the Total Time, we divide both sides by 0.30:
Total Time = 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours.

Now, we need to find out how much time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of his total time:
Sightseeing Time = 0.40 * 50 = 20 hours.

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:

"First, let's figure out how much money Annabelle earns from both jobs.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money she has:
- Money already saved: $80
- Money from first job: $200
- Money from second job: $75

Total money she has:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount she still needs to save is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The height of the shortest tree is 6 feet.
2. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is:
   6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet.
3. The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:
   6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet.
4. The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree, so its height is:
   2 × 17 feet = 34 feet.

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

"First, let's find out how much Dean spent at the toy store.

- Each toy car costs $2, and Dean bought 6 toy cars, so he spent 6 * $2 = $12 on toy cars.
- Each teddy bear costs $1, and Dean bought 5 teddy bears, so he spent 5 * $1 = $5 on teddy bears.

Now, let's add up the total amount Dean spent:
- Total spent = $12 (on toy cars) + $5 (on teddy bears) = $17.

Dean originally had $28, and he spent $17, so he has:
- $28 - $17 = $11 left.

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so now he has:
- $11 + $10 = $21.

"To figure out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first see how much everything will cost for one person, including Morgan.

1. Mini-golf for one person costs $5.
2. Arcade tokens for one person cost $5.
3. Two rides on the go-karts for one person cost $10 x 2 = $20.

So, the total cost for one person (including Morgan) is:
$5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $30.

Morgan has $90 to spend. If one person costs $30, then the number of people (including Morgan) she can afford is:
$90 ÷ $30 = 3 people.

Since this includes Morgan, the number of friends she can invite is:
3 - 1 = 2 friends.

"First, let's figure out how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops, so:

25 cents × 4 = 100 cents

100 cents is the same as $1. So, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. If she spends $1 on lollipops, she saves:

$5 - $1 = $4

She saves $4 each day. Over 5 days, she saves:

$4 × 5 = $20

So, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days is:

40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2

This $2 is half of the change he had after buying the candy, so the total change he had was:

$2 * 2 = $4

Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is:

$10 - $4 = $6

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy he bought is:

$6 / $1.5/pound = 4 pounds

"To find out how old Carver's son is, we can set up an equation based on the information given. 

Let's say Carver's son's age is \( x \) years.

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be written as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = x \]
\[ 25 = x \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's find out the total distance the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities.

1. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
2. The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
3. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs of the trip.

The combined distance of the first two legs is:
75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles

The distance from the third city to the first city is:
175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles

Now, let's add up all the distances for one complete trip:
75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is:
300 miles/trip × 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total service distance by the distance traveled in one day:
18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

"First, we need to find out how many boys and girls are in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls:

52 members * 50% = 26 girls

On the day of the performance, only the girls are performing. However, half of them can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, we need to find out how many girls actually make it to the performance:

26 girls / 2 = 13 girls

The 3 teachers also decide to sing with the girls. So, we add the 3 teachers to the 13 girls who made it:

13 girls + 3 teachers = 16 people

So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

"To find out how much money David saves, we need to compare the cost of the ride bracelet to the cost of buying individual ride tickets for 9 rides.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Dasha, who buys individual ride tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
- Each ride ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs 2 tickets * $2 per ticket = $4.
- For 9 rides, the total cost is 9 rides * $4 per ride = $36.

Now, let's look at David's cost:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the total cost of buying individual ride tickets:
- Savings = Cost of individual tickets - Cost of ride bracelet
- Savings = $36 - $30 = $6

So, David saves $6.

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to figure out how many popsicles each of them has based on the ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. To find out how many popsicles each part represents, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles each of them has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To find out how much money Tim saves, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then compare it to the cost of his cable package.

1. **Cost of Netflix**: $10 a month.
2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus**: Each normally costs $10 a month, but with a 20% discount for bundling, the cost is reduced.

First, calculate the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus without the discount:
- Hulu: $10
- Disney Plus: $10
- Total: $10 + $10 = $20

Next, calculate the discount:
- 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

So, the discounted cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is:
- $20 - $4 = $16

Now, add the cost of Netflix:
- Netflix: $10
- Hulu and Disney Plus: $16
- Total cost of streaming services: $10 + $16 = $26

Finally, compare this to the cost of the cable package:
- Cost of cable: $60
- Cost of streaming services: $26
- Savings: $60 - $26 = $34

So, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his cable package.

"First, let's figure out how much time Carol spent on each part of her work:

- Writing the song: 4 hours
- Recording the song: Half of 4 hours is 2 hours
- Editing the song: 90 minutes, which is 1.5 hours

Now, let's add up the total time spent on all parts:

Total time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 20\% \]

"To find out how many books Wendy needs, we first need to figure out how many books are in the shelving system and then calculate 20 more than double that number.

1. The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books it can hold is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

2. Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the shelving system. First, we double the number of books:
   \[
   36 \times 2 = 72
   \]

3. Then, we add 20 to this number:
   \[
   72 + 20 = 92
   \]

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

"First, let's figure out how many Valentine's cards Erica had in total. She made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes of 15 cards each. So, the total number of cards from the boxes is 2 * 15 = 30 cards. Adding the cards she made, Erica had 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

Next, we need to find out how many cards she passed out. She passed out 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family, which is a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, we subtract the number of cards she passed out from the total number of cards she had. So, 50 - 29 = 21 cards are left.

Finally, we add the 17 cards she received from family and friends to the cards she has left. So, 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"First, let's figure out how many slices Bill and Mark get.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
1/3 of 12 = 12 / 3 = 4 slices for Bill.

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So:
1/4 of 12 = 12 / 4 = 3 slices for Mark.

Now, let's add up the slices given to Bill and Mark:
4 slices (Bill) + 3 slices (Mark) = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, the total number of slices eaten or given away is:
7 slices (Bill and Mark) + 2 slices (Jenny) = 9 slices.

Finally, to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten or given away from the total number of slices:
12 slices (total) - 9 slices (eaten or given away) = 3 slices left.

"To find out how many bugs Nancy counted in total, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.

2. **Number of millipedes**: She saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders. So, the number of millipedes is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \text{ millipedes}
   \]

3. **Number of stink bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, the number of stink bugs is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \text{ stink bugs}
   \]

4. **Total number of bugs**: To find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:
   \[
   90 + 30 + 48 = 168
   \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168.

"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a week.
2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.
3. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.
4. Calculate the total earnings for the year.

Step 1: The builder works 6 days every week.

Step 2: Since the builder works 4 weeks every month, the number of days worked in a month is:
\[ 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

Step 3: There are 12 months in a year, so the number of days worked in a year is:
\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

Step 4: The builder gets paid $50 every day, so the total earnings for the year are:

"To find out how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner.
2. Determine the reduction in daily energy usage when the air conditioner is used for fewer hours.
3. Calculate the total energy saved over 30 days.

First, let's find out how much energy the air conditioner uses in one day when it is used for 8 hours:
\[ 900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily usage to kilowatt-hours (kWh):
\[ 7200 \text{ watt-hours} \div 1000 = 7.2 \text{ kWh} \]

Next, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage time is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The new daily energy usage is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours} \]
\[ 2700 \text{ watt-hours} \div 1000 = 2.7 \text{ kWh} \]

The reduction in daily energy usage is:
\[ 7.2 \text{ kWh} - 2.7 \text{ kWh} = 4.5 \text{ kWh} \]

Finally, the total energy saved over 30 days is:
\[ 4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kWh} \]

"To find out how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Tyson needs to serve 20 people, and each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - Number of sandwiches = 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - Total meat needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.
   - Total cheese needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:**
   - Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
   - Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
   - Cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
   - Cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

So, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"First, let's find out how many corns Allan originally has. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, he has:
2 * 40 = 80 corns

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is:
40 + 60 = 100 cannolis

Now, Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he has after the purchase. So, he buys:
100 - 40 = 60 corns

Adding these 60 corns to the original 80 corns, the new total of corns is:
80 + 60 = 140 corns

Finally, to find the combined total of corns and cannolis, we add the total number of corns and the total number of cannolis:
140 corns + 100 cannolis = 240

   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Pay per hour: $15
   - Hours per week: 40
   - Weeks in a month: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month for simplicity)

   First, calculate the weekly pay for one employee:
   \[
   15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

   Then, calculate the monthly pay for one employee:
   \[

Next, Sally bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

Then, she bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each. The total cost for the magnets is:
4 * $0.25 = $1.00

Now, let's add up all her expenses:
$4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1.00 (magnets) = $7.00

Sally started with $10. To find out how much she has left, we subtract her total expenses from the $10:
$10 - $7.00 = $3.00

"To solve this problem, let's use simple math. We know that each camel and dromedary has one head, and camels have 2 humps while dromedaries have 1 hump.

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads (each animal has one head):
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is:
\[
56

"To find out how many kilometers Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into parts and add up the distances.

1. **First 4 days**: Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total for 4 days: \(200 \times 4 = 800\) kilometers.

2. **Next 2 days**: He traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - 30% of 800 kilometers: \(0.30 \times 800 = 240\) kilometers.
   - Total for 2 days: 240 kilometers.

3. **Next 1 day**: He didn't travel at all.
   - Total for 1 day: 0 kilometers.

4. **Second week (7 days)**: He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total for 7 days: \(300 \times 7 = 2100\) kilometers.

Now, we add up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 \]

"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's elevation and the comb's elevation.

First, we know Stanley was at 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. So, the comb landed at:
10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

Next, Oliver is at 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

So, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

So, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
$17000"
"First, we start with 50 cats on the rock. 

Four boats came and each carried away 5 cats. So, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:
4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

Now, subtract the number of cats carried away by the boats from the initial number of cats:
50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find out how many cats that is, we calculate:
3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

Finally, subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:
30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:

"To find out how much 2 years of the service cost Bill, we need to break down the costs into different periods and then add them up.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   - 6 months * $8/month = $48

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   - 8 months * $12/month = $96

3. **Remaining time at $14 a month:**
   - 2 years = 24 months
   - Total months already accounted for = 6 months + 8 months = 14 months
   - Remaining months = 24 months - 14 months = 10 months
   - 10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add up all the costs:
- $48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - 1/3 of $6 is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is 2/3 of the total savings, came from the tattered jeans.
   - 2/3 of $6 is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 and saved $4, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 and saved $2, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles rented.

1. **Buses**: There are 4 buses, each with a capacity of 60 employees.
   - Total capacity of buses = 4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees

2. **Minibusses**: There are 6 minibusses, each with a capacity of 30 employees.
   - Total capacity of minibusses = 6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees

3. **Minivans**: There are 10 minivans, each with a capacity of 15 employees.
   - Total capacity of minivans = 10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles:
- Total capacity = 240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

"To find out how many birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders separately, and then add them together.

1. **Homemade Feeders:**
   - Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders.
   - Each homemade feeder attracts 20 birds plus an additional 10 birds.
   - So, each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.
   - Total birds attracted by homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds per feeder = 90 birds.

2. **Store-Bought Feeders:**
   - Lillian buys 3 store-bought feeders.
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Total birds attracted by store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds per feeder = 60 birds.

3. **Total Birds:**
   - Total birds attracted by all feeders: 90 birds (homemade) + 60 birds (store-bought) = 150 birds.

So, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needed to save to go to the amusement park:** This includes the cost of the ticket and the spending cash. So, $100 (ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150.

2. **Calculate how many cards Kenny sold to make $150:** Since he sells each card for $1.5, we divide the total amount of money by the price per card. So, $150 ÷ $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Find out how many cards Kenny kept:** He kept 1/3 of his cards. If he sold 100 cards, these 100 cards represent the 2/3 of his total collection that he sold. To find the total number of cards, we can set up the equation: 2/3 of total cards = 100 cards. To find the total, we solve for the total cards: total cards = 100 cards ÷ (2/3) = 100 cards × (3/2) = 150 cards.

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests.
2. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. 
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - So, 18 guests can have 2 hotdogs each, and the other 18 guests can have 1 hotdog each.

3. Calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared:
   - 18 guests with 2 hotdogs each: 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs
   - 18 guests with 1 hotdog each: 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs
   - Total hotdogs prepared: 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs

4. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog.
   - Each of the 40 guests wants 2 hotdogs.
   - Total hotdogs needed: 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs

5. Determine how many hotdogs are missing:
   - Hotdogs needed: 80
   - Hotdogs prepared: 54
   - Hotdogs missing: 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs

6. Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs to be satisfied, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:
   - 26 hotdogs missing / 2 hotdogs per guest = 13 guests

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 13.

"First, let's find out how much Charlotte's items cost before the discount.

1. The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. The 5 utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 20%, so we find 20% of $165.00:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the length from yards to feet**: Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we multiply the length in yards by 3.
   \[
   \text{Length in feet} = 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Find the width of the room**: We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the formula for the area of a rectangle is:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
   \]
   Plugging in the known values:
   \[
   360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width}

**Swim:**
James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. 
10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes (0.10 * 40 = 4).
So, James takes 40 - 4 = 36 minutes for the swim.

**Bike:**
James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike.
So, James takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes for the bike.

**Run:**
We know Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes longer than Jon in total.
Total time for James:
170 + 10 = 180 minutes

"To find out how many crayons Beatrice bought in all, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that had eight pieces each and the total number of crayons in the four packets that had sixteen pieces each, and then add these two totals together.

First, we calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that had eight pieces each:
6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that had sixteen pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the two totals together to find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The cost of the movie ticket is $12.
2. The cost of the soda is $3.
3. The total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda is $12 + $3 + (price of popcorn).
4. If you buy the super ticket, it costs $20 and includes the movie, popcorn, and soda for $1 extra, making it $21 in total.
5. You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $21 - $2 = $19.
6. Therefore, the cost of the popcorn is $19 - $12 - $3 = $4.

The regular price of the popcorn is $4."
"First, we need to find out how much it cost to fill one helium balloon before the price increase. We know that 20 balloons cost $900, so we divide $900 by 20 to find the cost per balloon:
\[ \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]
So, each balloon cost $45 before the price increase.

Next, we need to find out the new cost per balloon after the price increase. The price of each balloon was increased by $20, so we add $20 to the original cost:
\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]
Now, each balloon costs $65.

Finally, we need to calculate how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:
\[ 65 \times 170 = 11050 \]

So, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.

"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then divide the total distance by the total time.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - For the first part of the trip, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours.
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - For the second part of the trip, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour.
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - Total distance:
     \[
     120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time spent at each speed.
     \[
     2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - Average speed is the total distance divided by the total time.
     \[
     \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
     \]

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph.

"First, let's figure out how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. She starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 away, so:
8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

Next, let's find out how many rubies she gets. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she now has:
2 rubies.

Now, let's calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Each sapphire is worth $800, so:
5 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $4000.

Next, let's calculate the value of the rubies. Each ruby is worth $1200, so:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400.

Finally, let's add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:
$4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. First, calculate how many apples one person eats in a day. Both Marin and Nancy eat 4 apples each day.
2. Then, find out how many apples both of them eat together in one day. Since each eats 4 apples, together they eat:
   \[ 4 \text{ apples} + 4 \text{ apples} = 8 \text{ apples per day} \]
3. Next, to find out how many apples they eat in 30 days, multiply the number of apples they eat per day by the number of days:
   \[ 8 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days is 240.

"First, we need to find out how much soil Bob needs in total. We do this by calculating the volume of one raised bed and then multiplying by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is:
2 feet (width) x 8 feet (length) x 2 feet (height) = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet

Next, we need to find out how many bags of potting soil Bob will need. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so:
320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag = 160 bags

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each bag costs $12, so:
160 bags x $12/bag = $1920

"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. If there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate 60% of 15 red cards:

60% of 15 = 0.60 * 15 = 9

So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards. Therefore, the total number of green cards is:

15 (red cards) + 9 = 24 green cards

Next, we need to find out how many yellow cards there are. The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards:

15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards) = 39 yellow cards

Now, we add up all the cards:

15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards) + 39 (yellow cards) = 78

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to add up the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

First, we add the total number of puppies:
8 (Jennifer's puppies) + 12 (Brandon's puppies) = 20 puppies in total.

Next, we add the number of puppies with spots:
3 (Jennifer's spotted puppies) + 4 (Brandon's spotted puppies) = 7 spotted puppies in total.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating the fraction:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]

Then, converting to a percentage:
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%.

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed he is buying.

1. **Sugar cubes**: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
2. **Carrots**: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
3. **Hay**: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
4. **Oats**: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up all the weights:
- Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
- Total weight = 4500 pounds

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
- Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
- Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
- Number of trips = 2

Since the result is a whole number, the farmer will need exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the earnings from both the aluminum cans and the plastic bottles she recycles each week, and then multiply by four.

1. Calculate the weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
   - Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
   - Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
   - So, the weekly earnings from aluminum cans are \(3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents}\).

2. Calculate the weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
   - Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
   - Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - So, the weekly earnings from plastic bottles are \(5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents}\).

3. Calculate the total weekly earnings:
   - Total weekly earnings = Earnings from cans + Earnings from bottles
   - Total weekly earnings = \(6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents}\).

4. Calculate the total earnings for a four-week month:
   - Total monthly earnings = Total weekly earnings \(\times 4\)
   - Total monthly earnings = \(21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}\).

So, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for the apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each:
20 apples * 45 cents/apple = 900 cents

Since 100 cents make a dollar, Becky's total before the discount is:
900 cents / 100 = $9.00

Becky received a $1 discount, so her final cost is:
$9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00

Now, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for the apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each:
20 apples * 50 cents/apple = 1000 cents

Kelly's total before the discount is:
1000 cents / 100 = $10.00

Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is:
10% of $10.00 = 0.10 * $10.00 = $1.00

Kelly's final cost is:

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is \( C \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}C + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}C + 2 \]

To solve for \( C \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}C \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}C \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( C \):
\[ 3 \times 2 = C \]
\[ 6 = C \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras take up, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the total length of the remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's length that the remoras' total length represents.

First, convert the length of one remora from inches to feet:
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- 6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, the total length of the remoras is:
- 2 remoras * 0.5 feet/remora = 1 foot

Now, calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras' total length represents:
- Shark's length = 10 feet
- Remoras' total length = 1 foot
- Percentage = (Remoras' total length / Shark's length) * 100
- Percentage = (1 / 10) * 100 = 10%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

First, we find out how many oranges Stetson ate. They picked 60 oranges, and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. We calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 \]

\[ \text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} \]

\[ \text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{120}{5} \]

\[ \text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = 24 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up. He gives up $10 for each orange he eats. So, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by $10:

\[ \text{Total amount of money} = 24 \times 10 \]

\[ \text{Total amount of money} = 240 \]

So, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the total miles James runs in a week.
   - James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week.
   - So, \( 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \).

2. Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends running to cover these 60 miles.
   - James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
   - To find the time, we divide the total miles by the speed.
   - So, \( 60 \text{ miles} \div 10 \text{ miles/hour} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

James runs 6 hours a week.

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for one horse:**
   - Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - So, one horse eats \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for all four horses:**
   - One horse eats 10 pounds of oats per day.
   - Uncle Ben has four horses.
   - So, four horses eat \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total oats consumption for five days:**
   - The horses eat 40 pounds of oats per day.
   - Over five days, they will eat \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - To find out how many bags are needed, divide the total pounds by the pounds per bag: \(200 \text{ pounds} \div 50 \text{ pounds/bag} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To find out how many days it will take the child to save enough money to buy the toy car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the toy car: $12.
2. Subtract the amount the child already has: $4.
   $12 - $4 = $8
   So, the child needs to save $8 more.

3. The child saves $2 each day. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we divide the total amount needed by the amount saved each day:
   $8 ÷ $2 = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many eggs Jaime can place on the trays and then see how many are left over.

1. First, we find out how many eggs can fit on 2 trays. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs, we multiply 24 by 2:
   \[
   24 \times 2 = 48
   \]
   So, 48 eggs can fit on 2 trays.

2. Jaime has 64 eggs in total. To find out how many eggs won't fit on the trays, we subtract the number of eggs that can fit on the trays from the total number of eggs:
   \[
   64 - 48 = 16
   \]

So, the number of eggs that won't fit on the trays is 16.

"First, let's figure out the total cost of the razors before using the coupon. Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather only needs to pay for one pack to get two packs.

1 pack costs $4.00, so 2 packs (with the sale) cost $4.00.

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the total cost:
$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Heather gets 2 packs, and each pack has 4 razors, so she gets:
2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors

The cost per razor is:
$2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.25 to cents:
$0.25 = 25 cents

"To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation where the total cost of each venue is the same.

For the first venue:
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food is $5 per person.
- So, the total cost for the first venue is $200 + $5 * number of guests.

For the second venue:
- The cost is $25 per person, which includes food.
- So, the total cost for the second venue is $25 * number of guests.

We set these two costs equal to each other to find the number of guests where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, let's use some simple math steps.

1. Let's say the number of insects Bodhi found is \( B \).
2. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \).
3. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \).

Together, they found 43 insects, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \left( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \right) = 43 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43 \]
\[ B + B + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

2. Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 2B = 36 \]

3. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ B = 18 \]

So, Bodhi found 18 insects. Now, let's find out how many David and Lily found:

- David found \( \frac{B}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) insects.
- Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \) insects.

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then multiply by the total number of yards in a skein.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

1/4 + 1/2 = 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

This means they used 3/4 of a skein of yarn together. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply 3/4 by 364 to find out how many yards they used:

3/4 * 364 = 273

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"First, we find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug is:
3 feet + 5 feet = 8 feet wide.

Next, we calculate the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, twice the width of the rug is:
2 * 8 feet = 16 feet.

Adding 2 feet to this gives us the length of the couch:
16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet.

So, the couch is 18 feet long.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
2. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum.
3. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.
4. She paid half as much for a pack of green apple gum, which means she paid $2 / 2 = $1 for the green apple gum.
5. The total amount she paid for all the gum is $7.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the grape and green apple gums:
- Grape gum: $2
- Green apple gum: $1
- Total for grape and green apple gums: $2 + $1 = $3

Since the total amount paid is $7, the amount paid for the strawberry gum is:
- Total amount paid - Total for grape and green apple gums = $7 - $3 = $4

Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the cost per pack of strawberry gum is:
- Total cost for strawberry gum / Number of packs = $4 / 2 = $2

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say the cost of the lot is \( L \).
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot, so the cost of the house is \( 3L \).
3. The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   L + 3L = 120,000

"To find out how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the number of rows for the blue tulips separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in one row.
- So, the number of rows for the red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) rows.

Next, let's calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in one row.
- So, the number of rows for the blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \) rows.

Now, we add the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips:
- Total rows = 6 rows (red) + 3 rows (blue) = 9 rows.

So, the total number of rows Jackson will plant is 9.

"First, we need to find out how many cups of raisins Heather will use for the oatmeal cookies. Since she divides the 27 cups of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we divide 27 by 3:

27 cups / 3 = 9 cups for the oatmeal cookies.

Next, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Since each batch takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we divide 9 cups by 3/4 cup:

9 cups / (3/4 cup) = 9 * (4/3) = 36/3 = 12 batches.

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"First, let's figure out how much Ada pays for her electricity before adding the new device.

1. Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
2. The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt per hour.
3. So, her daily cost is 12 kilowatts per hour * $1.50 = $18.
4. To find her weekly cost, we multiply the daily cost by 7 days: $18 * 7 = $126.

Next, let's calculate her new weekly cost after adding the device.

1. The new device will consume an additional 2 kilowatts per hour.
2. So, her new total daily consumption is 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.
3. Her new daily cost is 14 kilowatts per hour * $1.50 = $21.
4. Her new weekly cost is $21 * 7 = $147.

Finally, we find the difference between her new weekly cost and her old weekly cost.

1. The difference is $147 - $126 = $21.

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of one person:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since 5 days is for half a house).

2. **Convert days to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, which is 10 * 24 = 240 hours.

3. **Determine the rate for 5 people:**
   - If one person takes 240 hours to paint a house, then 5 people working together will take 240 / 5 = 48 hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Let's start by figuring out how many chairs Ophelia has. We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas and that she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. This means Ophelia has:

20 sofas + 2 = 22 chairs

Now, Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has:

3 * 22 chairs = 66 chairs

Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has:

66 chairs - 2 = 64 sofas

Now we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:

Ophelia's sofas + Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's sofas + Jenna's chairs
20 sofas + 22 chairs + 64 sofas + 66 chairs

Now, let's add these numbers together:

20 + 22 + 64 + 66 = 172

"To find out the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we can break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total hours for the regular weeks:**
   - Josh worked out for 4 hours each week.
   - There are 8 weeks in total, but some weeks were different.
   - First, we need to identify how many weeks he followed the regular 4-hour routine.

2. **Identify the weeks with different workout hours:**
   - He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks.
   - He spent 6 hours in one week.

3. **Calculate the total hours for the different weeks:**
   - For the two weeks with 5 hours each: \(5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours}\)
   - For the one week with 6 hours: \(6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours}\)

4. **Determine the number of regular weeks:**
   - Total weeks: 8
   - Weeks with 5 hours: 2
   - Week with 6 hours: 1
   - Regular weeks: \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5 \text{ weeks}\)

5. **Calculate the total hours for the regular weeks:**
   - \(4 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ hours}\)

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Initial number of passengers on the bus:** 48

2. **First stop:**
   - **Passengers getting off:** 8
   - **Passengers getting on:** 5 times the number who got off = 5 * 8 = 40

   **Passengers after the first stop:**
   - 48 (initial) - 8 (got off) + 40 (got on) = 80

3. **Second stop:**
   - **Passengers getting off:** 21
   - **Passengers getting on:** 3 times fewer than the number who got off = 21 / 3 = 7

   **Passengers after the second stop:**
   - 80 (after first stop) - 21 (got off) + 7 (got on) = 66

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - So, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - So, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"To find out how much one monitor costs, let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's add the cost of the computer and the printer:
$1,100 (computer) + $700 (printer) = $1,800

The total cost of the 2 monitors is the total cost minus the cost of the computer and the printer:
$2,400 (total) - $1,800 (computer + printer) = $600

Since this is the cost for 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is:
$600 / 2 = $300

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - They are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
   - Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each boy:**
   - Each boy brought back 60 seashells.

3. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - This means each girl brought \( 60 + 4 \times 60 \) seashells.
   - First, calculate \( 4 \times 60 \):
     \[
     4 \times 60 = 240
     \]
   - Then, add this to the 60 seashells:
     \[
     60 + 240 = 300
     \]

So, each girl brought 300 seashells.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to add the thickness of each book together. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The thickness of the first book is 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm.

Now, we add the thickness of all four books together:
31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Monthly Saving Target**: Elvis wants to save $1125 in April.

2. **Number of Days in April**: April has 30 days.

3. **First Half of April**: The first half of April has 15 days.
4. **Second Half of April**: The second half of April also has 15 days.

5. **Daily Savings in the First Half**: Let's call the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April \( x \).

6. **Daily Savings in the Second Half**: According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much each day in the second half as he saves in the first half. So, he will save \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

7. **Total Savings in the First Half**: For 15 days, the total savings in the first half will be \( 15x \).

8. **Total Savings in the Second Half**: For 15 days, the total savings in the second half will be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

9. **Total Monthly Savings**: The total savings for the month should be the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half:
   \[
   15x + 30x = 45x
   \]

10. **Setting Up the Equation**: We know the total savings should be $1125, so:
    \[
    45x = 1125
    \]

11. **Solving for \( x \)**:
    \[
    x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
    \]

12. **Daily Savings in the Second Half**: Since \( x = 25 \), the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the second half is:
    \[
    2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
    \]

So, Elvis has to save **$50** each day in the second half of April.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how much money Brad gets first, and then we can find out how much Jeff gets.

Let's say Brad gets \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money they have together is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"First, let's find out how much Daniel would spend without the discount.

- The cost of five notebooks is 5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50
- The cost of two pens is 2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50
- The cost of one calculator is 1 calculator * $12/calculator = $12.00
- The cost of one geometry set is 1 geometry set * $10.00/geometry set = $10.00

Now, let's add up all these costs to find the total before the discount:
$7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, so the discount amount is:
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Daniel has to spend:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

"First, let's figure out how long Ray takes to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. 

Twice as long as 16 minutes is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes more:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

"First, we need to find out how much coffee Octavia drinks. Since she drinks half the daily recommended amount and the daily recommendation is 4 cups, Octavia drinks:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so he drinks:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

The doctor wants Juan to reduce his intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. So, the reduction needed is:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to add the number of hamsters and the number of guinea pigs together.

First, we calculate the total number of hamsters:
3 cages × 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters

Next, we calculate the total number of guinea pigs:
3 cages × 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs together:
30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

So, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total.

"First, let's find out how much Susan weighs. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we subtract 20 from Mark's weight:
150 - 20 = 130 pounds

Now, let's find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so we multiply Susan's weight by 2:
130 * 2 = 260 pounds

Next, we add the weights of Mark, Susan, and Bob to find the total weight:
150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3:
540 / 3 = 180 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the movement of the sun and how it affects the angle from the ground to the sun.

1. **Initial Angle**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when viewed from Sahir's house.

2. **Sun's Movement**: The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Final Angle**: The final angle from the ground to the sun will be the initial angle plus the angle the sun has moved upward:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees.

"First, we need to find out the ages of James's two sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, which means the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we add the ages of the two sons to find out the total number of candles needed: 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since the candles come in packs of 5, we need to figure out how many packs of 5 candles are needed to get at least 20 candles. We do this by dividing the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Each pack costs $3, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 × 3 = $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages she read in the first week and add that to the pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the total reading time in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- So, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we need to convert the reading time in the first week into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes: \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).
- Now, we multiply the number of pages she reads per minute by the total minutes she read in the first week: \( \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \times 105 \text{ minutes} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages read in both weeks:
- Pages read in the first week: 140 pages
- Pages read in the second week: 100 pages
- Total pages read in two weeks: \( 140 + 100 = 240 \text{ pages} \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Shiloh's age in 7 years:**
   Shiloh is currently 44 years old. In 7 years, he will be:
   \[
   44 + 7 = 51 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Set up the equation for the nephew's age:**
   Let \( n \) be the current age of Shiloh's nephew. In 7 years, the nephew will be \( n + 7 \) years old.

3. **Use the given information to form an equation:**
   According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can write:
   \[
   51 = 3 \times (n + 7)
   \]

4. **Solve the equation for \( n \):**
   First, divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   51 \div 3 = n + 7
   \]
   \[
   17 = n + 7
   \]
   Next, subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   17 - 7 = n
   \]
   \[
   n = 10
   \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to add up all the money she received for each tooth.

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, she received $1.00 each, so that's $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, she received half of $1.00, which is $0.50, for each tooth. So for two teeth, that's $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.

Now, we add all the amounts together:
$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00

So, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount Peter spends each day:**
   - Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days).
   - Total amount to be spent each day = $70 ÷ 7 = $10 per day.

2. **Calculate the number of wooden action figures bought from Sunday to Wednesday:**
   - From Sunday to Wednesday, there are 4 days.
   - Each wooden action figure costs $5.
   - Number of wooden action figures bought each day = $10 ÷ $5 = 2 figures.
   - Total wooden action figures bought from Sunday to Wednesday = 2 figures/day × 4 days = 8 figures.

3. **Calculate the number of plastic action figures bought from Thursday to Saturday:**
   - From Thursday to Saturday, there are 3 days.
   - Each plastic action figure costs $2.
   - Number of plastic action figures bought each day = $10 ÷ $2 = 5 figures.
   - Total plastic action figures bought from Thursday to Saturday = 5 figures/day × 3 days = 15 figures.

4. **Calculate the total number of action figures:**

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many roses Ford needs to supply all the flower shops in a month and compare it to how many roses he can grow in a month.

1. First, let's find out how many roses Ford grows in a month. Since there are about 4 weeks in a month, and he grows 40 roses each week:
   \[
   40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 160 \text{ roses/month}
   \]

2. Next, let's calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month. The first shop orders 20 roses, the second shop orders 15 roses, and the third shop orders 30 roses each week. So, the total number of roses ordered by all shops each week is:
   \[
   20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses/week}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how many roses are ordered in a month:
   \[
   65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 260 \text{ roses/month}
   \]

4. Finally, to find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the number of roses he can grow in a month from the number of roses the shops order in a month:
   \[
   260 \text{ roses/month} - 160 \text{ roses/month} = 100 \text{ roses/month}
   \]

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how much money Katina will have left in her savings account after 2 years if she removes $100 every month.

1. First, we need to find out how many months are in 2 years:
   - 1 year = 12 months
   - 2 years = 2 * 12 = 24 months

2. Next, we calculate how much money Katina will remove in total over 24 months:
   - $100 per month * 24 months = $2400

3. Finally, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the savings account:
   - Initial amount = $3000
   - Total amount removed = $2400
   - Remaining amount = $3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

"To find out how much it will cost Michael to replace the carpet, we need to calculate the total cost for the new carpet, padding, removing the old carpet, and installing the new carpet. 

First, let's find the area of the bedroom:
- The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.
- Area = 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

Next, we calculate the cost for each part:
1. **Cost of the new carpet:**
   - The new carpet costs $12 per square foot.
   - Total cost for the carpet = 216 square feet * $12/square foot = $2,592.

2. **Cost of the padding:**
   - The padding costs $2 per square foot.
   - Total cost for the padding = 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432.

3. **Cost to remove the old carpet:**
   - The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet.
   - Total cost to remove the old carpet = 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864.

4. **Cost to install the new carpet:**
   - The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.
   - Total cost to install the new carpet = 216 square feet * $34/square foot = $7,344.

Now, we add up all these costs to get the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of the new carpet + Cost of the padding + Cost to remove the old carpet + Cost to install the new carpet
- Total cost = $2,592 + $432 + $864 + $7,344 = $11,232.

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $11,232.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out by what percentage the oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct setting for 520 degrees.

1. First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees:
   - The actual temperature is 468 degrees.
   - The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.
   - The percentage error is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

2. Now, we need to find the temperature setting that will result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is off by 4%.
   - If the oven is off by 4%, then the actual temperature is 104% of the set temperature.
   - Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to.
   - We can set up the equation: \( 1.04x = 520 \).

3. Solve for \( x \):

- **Day 0**: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- **Day 1**: The beanstalk doubles to 4 * 2 = 8 feet.
- **Day 2**: The beanstalk doubles again to 8 * 2 = 16 feet.
- **Day 3**: The beanstalk doubles again to 16 * 2 = 32 feet.

On Day 3, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than 20 feet.

So, it takes 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - We know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein.
   - So, 200 grams of mushrooms will have twice the amount of protein.
   - \( 3 \text{ grams of protein} \times 2 = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \)

2. **Calculate the weekly protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, the total protein intake per week is:
   - \( 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams of protein} \)

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say Jerry's current age is \( J \).
2. Five years ago, Jerry was \( J - 5 \) years old.
3. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   J = 2 \times (J - 5)
   \]
4. Now, let's solve the equation:
   \[
   J = 2J - 10
   \]
   \[
   J - 2J = -10
   \]
   \[
   -J = -10
   \]
   \[
   J = 10
   \]
5. Jerry is currently 10 years old.
6. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
   \[
   10 + 3 = 13
   \]

So, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"First, let's figure out the total cost of the dental work. George needs 2 implants, and each implant costs $2000. So, the cost for 2 implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

One of the implants needs a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500. So, we add this to the total cost:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already paid a deposit of $600. We subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to pay:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George earns $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 3900 \div 15 = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the angles in terms of the smallest angle:**
   - Let the smallest angle be \( x \) degrees.
   - The second angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees.
   - The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
   - Therefore, \( x + 2x + 3x = 180 \).

3. **Combine like terms:**
   - \( x + 2x + 3x = 6x \).
   - So, \( 6x = 180 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 6: \( x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \).

5. **Find the measure of the largest angle:**
   - The largest angle is \( 3x \).
   - Substitute \( x = 30 \) into \( 3x \): \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \).

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how fast the plane is traveling. We can do this by dividing the distance it travels by the time it takes.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. So, the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We can use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to travel 2000 miles is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, in one hour, he makes:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds Marissa makes in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. So, Marissa makes:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate how many pounds each of them makes in 12 hours. Ruiz makes:
\[ 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

And Marissa makes:
\[ 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together, we add the amounts made by Ruiz and Marissa:

"To find out how much money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each part of his lemonade selling and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- He sold lemonade for 4 hours.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.

So, the total number of cups sold in the first four hours is:
15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups

The total earnings from the first four hours are:
60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- He sold lemonade for 2 hours.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.

So, the total number of cups sold in the next two hours is:
10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups

The total earnings from the next two hours are:
20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, we add the earnings from both parts to find the total earnings:
$30 + $12 = $42

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many times the tires rotate in a month and then how many months (or years) it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.

1. First, we find out how many times the tires rotate in 400 miles:
   - Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - For 400 miles, the number of rotations is \( 400 \div 2 \times 725 = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \) rotations per month.

2. Next, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
   - Total rotations needed to replace a tire: 10,440,000
   - Rotations per month: 145,000
   - Number of months to replace a tire: \( 10,440,000 \div 145,000 = 72 \) months.

3. Finally, we convert the number of months into years:
   - Number of years: \( 72 \div 12 = 6 \) years.

So, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs, we first need to figure out the total number of pumps in the bottle and then divide the cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps.

1. The bottle gives 120 washings using 2 pumps per wash. So, the total number of pumps in the bottle is:
   \[
   120 \text{ washings} \times 2 \text{ pumps/washing} = 240 \text{ pumps}
   \]

2. The cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:
   \[
   \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars/pump}
   \]

3. Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):
   \[
   0.10 \text{ dollars/pump} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents/pump}
   \]

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   - John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Total Research Time:**
   - The research takes 10 times longer than the initial 5 months.
   - Total research time = 5 months * 10 = 50 months.

3. **Funding for the Remaining Months:**
   - The remaining months after the first 5 months = 50 months - 5 months = 45 months.
   - Each of these months costs 50% more than the initial monthly cost.
   - Initial monthly cost = $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month.
   - Increased monthly cost = $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

4. **Total Cost for the Remaining 45 Months:**
   - Total cost for the remaining 45 months = 45 months * $30,000 per month = $1,350,000.

5. **Total Research Cost:**
   - Total cost = Initial funding + Cost for the remaining months
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - So, each of these days, the tow truck pulled \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) cars.
   - For four days: \( 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \)

3. **Calculate the total number of cars towed in the week:**
   - Add the number of cars towed in the first three days to the number of cars towed in the remaining four days.
   - Total cars: \( 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \)

So, the total number of cars towed that week is:

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

1. First, we need to convert the height requirement from feet to inches because Adam's height is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Adam is currently 40 inches tall and needs to be 48 inches tall to ride the roller coaster. So, we need to find out how many more inches he needs to grow:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Adam grows 2 inches each year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide the total inches he needs to grow by the number of inches he grows each year:
   \[
   8 \text{ inches} \div 2 \text{ inches/year} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

So, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Calculate the cost the company paid to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the acquisition cost from the total sales.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

Step 1: Total sales amount
James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
Total sales = 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000

Step 2: Cost to acquire the cars
The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire them.
Acquisition cost = 30% of $250,000 = 0.30 * $250,000 = $75,000

Step 3: Calculate the profit
Profit = Total sales - Acquisition cost
Profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

Step 4: James's commission
James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
Commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

So, James made $17,500.

"To find out how many men can stay upright on the wave, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright.
2. Determine how many of these are women.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright.
- 25% of 100 riders can stay upright.
- 25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

Step 2: Determine how many of these are women.
- 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women.
- 60% of 25 = 0.60 * 25 = 15 women.

Step 3: Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men.
- Total riders who can stay upright = 25
- Number of women = 15
- Number of men = 25 - 15 = 10

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. Since the diamond jewel costs $2000, we calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

Next, we find the price of the silver jewel. The silver jewel costs $400 less than the gold jewel. So, we subtract $400 from the price of the gold jewel:

Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we add up the prices of all three jewels to find the total price:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

"To figure out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to find out how much faster Tom is going compared to Bob and then see how long it will take for Tom to cover the 75 miles gap.

1. First, find the difference in their speeds:
   - Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
   - Difference in speed: 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour

2. This means Tom is gaining 15 miles on Bob every hour.

3. Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Tom to gain 75 miles:
   - Distance to catch up: 75 miles
   - Speed difference: 15 miles per hour
   - Time to catch up: 75 miles ÷ 15 miles per hour = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class he attends goes over $10.

1. First, we know the total cost for the classes is $60.
2. Manny's parents will only continue if the cost per class is $10 or less.
3. If there are 10 total classes, and he pays $60, then the cost per class if he attends all of them is $60 / 10 = $6 per class.
4. We need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class he attends exceeds $10.

Let's calculate the number of classes he can miss:
- If Manny misses 1 class, he attends 9 classes. The cost per class is $60 / 9 ≈ $6.67.
- If Manny misses 2 classes, he attends 8 classes. The cost per class is $60 / 8 = $7.50.
- If Manny misses 3 classes, he attends 7 classes. The cost per class is $60 / 7 ≈ $8.57.
- If Manny misses 4 classes, he attends 6 classes. The cost per class is $60 / 6 = $10.
- If Manny misses 5 classes, he attends 5 classes. The cost per class is $60 / 5 = $12.

So, if Manny misses 5 classes, the cost per class he attends will be $12, which is more than $10. Therefore, he can miss 4 classes before the cost per class he attends exceeds $10.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Jewel's daily production:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers each day.

2. **Determine Julie's daily production:**
   - Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel.
   - Therefore, Julie processes \( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) customers each day.

3. **Calculate the total daily production for both Julie and Jewel:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers.
   - Julie processes 100 customers.
   - Together, they process \( 50 + 100 = 150 \) customers each day.

4. **Calculate the total weekly production:**
   - They work all 7 days of the week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly production is \( 150 \times 7 = 1050 \) customers.

So, the total weekly production for the two is:

"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, let's break down the information given:

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. So, Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, if we let \(L\) represent the number of miles Lynn ran, then Reggie ran \(L + 3\) miles.

Since we know Reggie ran 20 miles, we can set up the equation:
\[ L + 3 = 20 \]

To find \(L\), we subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to first figure out the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - So, one apple costs $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - So, one orange costs $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10.

3. **Cost of 5 apples:**
   - One apple costs $1.30.
   - So, 5 apples cost 5 × $1.30 = $6.50.

4. **Cost of 5 oranges:**
   - One orange costs $1.10.
   - So, 5 oranges cost 5 × $1.10 = $5.50.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Total cost = Cost of 5 apples + Cost of 5 oranges
   - Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to calculate the volume of the hole first and then figure out the time based on how fast he can shovel.

1. **Calculate the volume of the hole:**
   - The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep.
   - Volume = length × width × depth
   - Volume = 6 feet × 4 feet × 3 feet
   - Volume = 72 cubic feet

2. **Calculate the time to dig the hole:**
   - Bob takes 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth.
   - Total time = volume × time per cubic foot
   - Total time = 72 cubic feet × 3 seconds per cubic foot
   - Total time = 216 seconds

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck and the costs of all the additional features he is getting.

1. **Base price of the truck**: $30,000
2. **King cab upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
   - \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \)
4. **Running boards**: $500 less than the leather seats
   - \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \)
5. **Upgraded exterior light package**: $1500

Now, we add all these costs together:

- Base price: $30,000
- King cab: $7,500
- Leather seats: $2,500
- Running boards: $2,000
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

"To find out how much money Tim will make in a year after his promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise.
2. Calculate the bonus he gets, which is half a month's salary based on his new salary.
3. Calculate his total annual salary by adding the monthly salary for 12 months and the bonus.

**Step 1: Calculate the new monthly salary.**

Tim's original salary is $20,000 a month. A 5% raise means he gets an additional 5% of $20,000.

5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000

So, his new monthly salary is:
$20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

**Step 2: Calculate the bonus.**

The bonus is half a month's salary based on his new salary:
Bonus = 0.5 * $21,000 = $10,500

**Step 3: Calculate the total annual salary.**

His total annual salary is the sum of his monthly salary for 12 months and the bonus:
Total annual salary = 12 * $21,000 + $10,500
Total annual salary = $252,000 + $10,500
Total annual salary = $262,500

So, Tim will make $262,500 in a year.

"To find out how much everything cost, we need to calculate the cost of the suits, the dress pants, and the dress shirts, and then add them all together.

1. **Cost of the suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of the dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of the dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 10 suits * 3 dress shirts/suit = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts
   - Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

So, the total cost for everything is $10800.

"To find out how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through both the soil and the clay.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so he can dig 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time to dig through the soil and the clay:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats were \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales for two months:**

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many sheep and how many geese Lee has on his farm. Let's use some simple math to find out.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads is \( S + G = 20 \).
   - Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, so the total number of legs is \( 4S + 2G = 70 \).

3. **Solve the first equation for one of the variables:**
   - From \( S + G = 20 \), we can solve for \( G \):
     \[
     G = 20 - S
     \]

4. **Substitute \( G \) in the second equation:**
   - Substitute \( G = 20 - S \) into \( 4S + 2G = 70 \):
     \[
     4S + 2(20 - S) = 70
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     4S + 40 - 2S = 70
     \]
     \[
     2S + 40 = 70
     \]
     \[
     2S = 30
     \]
     \[
     S = 15
     \]

5. **Find the number of geese:**
   - Substitute \( S = 15 \) back into \( G = 20 - S \):
     \[
     G = 20 - 15
     \]
     \[
     G = 5
     \]

So, Lee has 15 sheep and 5 geese on his farm.

"First, let's figure out how much the more expensive coffee costs. The normal coffee costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

20% of $5 is:
\[ 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive coffee costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \] dollars per pound.

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and buys a week's worth, which is 7 days. So, the total cost for the coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \] dollars.

He also bought a donut for $2. So, the total cost for everything is:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \] dollars.

"To find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to add up the cost of all the items Gus bought and then subtract that total from the $20.00 he spent.

First, let's add up the cost of the items we know:
- 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each: 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
- 1 bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- 1 bottle of soda for $1.00

Now, let's add these amounts together:
$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Gus spent $20.00 in total, so we subtract the cost of the items we know from the total amount spent:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, the apple pie cost $7.00.

"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - Newspapers to District A - Newspapers to District C
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 198 - 209
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

"First, we need to find out how many of the 150 teachers are history teachers. We do this by calculating 60% of 150:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

There are 60 math teachers. Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the hours each one sleeps:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars

Next, we find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so:

Rayna's money = 90 + 60 = 150 dollars

Now, let's add together the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

Total money = Rayna's money + Kassidy's money + Aurelia's money
Total money = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 dollars

If they decide to share the total money equally among the three of them, each person would get:

Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = 360 / 3 = 120 dollars

"To find out how much change Adam got, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought and then subtract that from the $15 he paid.

First, let's calculate the cost of the candies of type A:
- Adam bought 7 candies of type A.
- Each candy of type A costs $0.5.
- So, the total cost for type A candies is \( 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the candies of type B:
- Adam bought 10 candies of type B.
- Each candy of type B costs $0.75.
- So, the total cost for type B candies is \( 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \) dollars.

Now, let's add the costs of both types of candies to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of type A candies + cost of type B candies
- Total cost = \( 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \) dollars.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the amount Adam paid to find the change:
- Change = amount paid - total cost
- Change = \( 15 - 11 = 4 \) dollars.

So, Adam got $4 in change.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days in the Month**: 30 days
2. **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 days
3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 days

Now, let's look at the distribution of these days:
- **First 8 Days**: All good
- **Next 8 Days**: All bad
- **Next 8 Days**: All neutral
- **Remaining 6 Days**: We need to figure out the distribution of these days.

Since the first 24 days are already accounted for (8 good, 8 bad, 8 neutral), the remaining 6 days must be the last 6 days of the month.

According to the problem, the next three days after the first 24 days are:
- Good
- Neutral
- Good

So, the last 6 days of the month are:
- Good
- Neutral
- Good
- (3 more days, which are not specified, but we don't need to know them to solve the problem)

Now, let's count the total number of good days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Last 3 days: 2 good days

Total good days in the month: 8 + 2 = 10 good days

Since the problem asks how many good days were left in the month, and we know the month has 30 days, the number of good days left is:

10

"To find out how many books Sally has, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's say the number of books Sally has is \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

Now, we solve for \( S \):
1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = S \]
\[ 9 = S \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches per foot:
20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

The bamboo needs to grow to 600 inches. So, we need to find out how much more it needs to grow:
600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

The bamboo grows 30 inches a day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:
360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 8 toys to have enough for the 12 dogs, so he now has 4 (original) + 8 (new) = 12 toys.
4. When James returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy more toys for the additional 12 dogs (24 - 12 = 12), so he buys 12 more toys, making the total 12 (current) + 12 (new) = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs. The number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James needs to have 21 toys for the 21 dogs, but he already has 24 toys, so he doesn't need to buy any more.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 21.

"To find out by how much Jack and the 8 other adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the 8 other adults.
2. Add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 other adults.
3. Subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight calculated in step 2.

Let's assume Jack's weight is also 80 kg, as the problem does not specify his weight.

1. Total weight of 8 other adults:
   \( 8 \text{ adults} \times 80 \text{ kg/adult} = 640 \text{ kg} \)

2. Total weight including Jack:
   \( 640 \text{ kg} + 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \)

3. Exceeding the maximum load:

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final length. 

1. The final length of the dress is 140 cm.
2. This final length includes an additional 20 cm of lace trim.
3. So, the length of the dress before adding the lace trim is \(140 \text{ cm} - 20 \text{ cm} = 120 \text{ cm}\).
4. The 120 cm is 150% of the original length because Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length.
5. To find the original length, we need to calculate what 100% (the original length) is. We can set up the equation: 
   \[
   120 \text{ cm} = 150\% \text{ of the original length}
   \]
6. Converting 150% to a decimal, we get 1.5. So, the equation becomes:
   \[
   120 \text{ cm} = 1.5 \times \text{original length}
   \]
7. To find the original length, we divide both sides by 1.5:
   \[
   \text{original length} = \frac{120 \text{ cm}}{1.5} = 80 \text{ cm}
   \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

   - Half of 60 minutes is 30 minutes.

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, to mow half of the lawn, it would take him half of 40 minutes.
   - Half of 40 minutes is 20 minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we add the time for each half.

Now, we add the number of cookies Greta baked to the number of cookies Celinda baked to find the total number of cookies:

Total cookies = Greta's cookies + Celinda's cookies
Total cookies = 30 + 60
Total cookies = 90

Next, we need to subtract the number of cookies they ate from the total number of cookies to find out how many are left to put in the box:

"First, let's find out how much the candies cost. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so five lollipops cost:

5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the four candies:

$3.20 total - $2.00 for lollipops = $1.20 for four candies

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies:

$1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now we know the cost of one lollipop is $0.40 and the cost of one candy is $0.30. To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we calculate:

10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00
10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Adding these together gives us the total cost:

$4.00 for lollipops + $3.00 for candies = $7.00

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo $7.00.

$7.00"

"First, let's figure out the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40

Next, we know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill ""T"". The cost of the heartworm check is 0.60 * T.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
T = $40 + 0.60 * T

To find T, we need to solve this equation. First, we isolate T on one side:
T - 0.60 * T = $40
0.40 * T = $40

Now, we divide both sides by 0.40 to solve for T:
T = $40 / 0.40
T = $100

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
$125 - $100 = $25

4. **White squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, the number of white squares is:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we add up all the squares:
\[
14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

So, the total number of square feet of Brittany's comforter is 68.

"First, let's figure out how many chairs are needed for the adults and babies.

There are 42 adults, so we need 42 regular chairs for them. There are 15 babies, so we need 15 high chairs for them.

The restaurant already has 8 high chairs, which is enough for the babies since 8 is more than 15. However, we need to find out how many regular chairs the restaurant has. The problem states that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Since there are 8 high chairs, the restaurant has:

5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we need 42 regular chairs for the adults, but the restaurant only has 40. So, Mia needs to get:

42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs

Since the number of high chairs is sufficient, Mia only needs to get 2 more chairs in total.

"First, let's find out how many points each student has collected.

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
   - 30% of 50 is \( 0.30 \times 50 = 15 \).
   - So, Betty has \( 50 + 15 = 65 \) points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   - So, Tom has \( 65 - 30 = 35 \) points.
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   - So, Martha has \( 3 \times 35 = 105 \) points.

Now, let's add up all the points collected by the students:
- Adam: 50 points
- Betty: 65 points
- Tom: 35 points
- Martha: 105 points

Total points collected: \( 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \) points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing:
- \( 400 - 255 = 145 \) points.

2. Each of these 3 children has 3 children of their own (the grandchildren). So, the number of grandchildren is:
   \[
   3 \text{ children} \times 3 \text{ grandchildren per child} = 9 \text{ grandchildren}
   \]
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own (the great grand-babies). So, the number of great grand-babies is:
   \[
   9 \text{ grandchildren} \times 3 \text{ great grand-babies per grandchild} = 27 \text{ great grand-babies}
   \]

So, the number of great grand-babies that will be at the family reunion is:

"First, let's figure out how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account.

50% of $2400.00 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 2400 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200.00 into her retirement account.

Next, let's figure out how much she uses for her car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment.

20% of $2400.00 is:
\[ 0.20 \times 2400 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480.00 for her car payment.

Now, let's find out how much money she has left after funding her retirement and paying for her car. We subtract the amounts she put into retirement and her car payment from her total paycheck.

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

"To find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box, we first need to figure out how many pencils are actually in the box. 

The box can hold 20 pencils, but 4 pencils are missing. So, we subtract the missing pencils from the total capacity:
20 - 4 = 16 pencils are in the box.

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of pencils there are. Since a pair consists of 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils by 2:
16 ÷ 2 = 8 pairs of pencils.

8"
"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city's display that she can see and add the number of fireworks she sets off herself.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks in the city's display:
15 boxes * 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks:
300 fireworks * 40% = 120 fireworks

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah can see from the city's display to the fireworks she sets off:
120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

Hannah will see a total of 135 fireworks. 

135"
"First, let's find out how many people are in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so:

13 + 7 = 20 people

Each person saves a seat, and each seat can hold two drinks and three snacks. So, for 20 seats, the number of drinks and snacks is:

Drinks: 20 seats * 2 drinks/seat = 40 drinks
Snacks: 20 seats * 3 snacks/seat = 60 snacks

Now, we need to find out the total cost of the drinks and snacks. Since each drink and each snack costs $2, we calculate:

Cost of drinks: 40 drinks * $2/drink = $80
Cost of snacks: 60 snacks * $2/snack = $120

Adding the cost of drinks and snacks together gives us the total amount spent:

Total cost: $80 + $120 = $200

So, the group has spent $200 on snacks and drinks.

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much Gordy's truck can haul.
2. Add the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks.
3. Subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks to find Gary's truck capacity.

Step 1: Gordy's truck capacity
Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.
So, Gordy's truck can haul:
4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds

Step 2: Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks
Gissela's truck: 4,000 pounds
Gordy's truck: 4,800 pounds
Combined: 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds

Step 3: Gary's truck capacity
The total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.
So, Gary's truck can haul:
11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds

"To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by both the males and the females.

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings. There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings per female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Next, we know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:
\[ 3 \text{ dumplings} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]

There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings per male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

Now, we add the dumplings eaten by the males and the females to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked:
\[ 18 \text{ dumplings} + 32 \text{ dumplings} = 50 \text{ dumplings} \]

So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:

"To find out how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to figure out the speed of the turtle.

1. We know the cat's speed is 15 feet/second.
2. The cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, so we divide the cat's speed by 5 to find the turtle's speed:
   \[
   \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
   \]

3. Now, to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many hours in total the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, assuming they continue to raise the same amount of money each hour as they did in the first 3 hours.

1. First, we find out how much money they raised per hour in the first 3 hours:
   - They raised $2100 in 3 hours.
   - So, the amount raised per hour is $2100 ÷ 3 = $700 per hour.

2. Next, we need to find out how much more money they need to reach their goal:
   - Their goal is $6300.
   - They have already raised $2100.
   - So, the remaining amount needed is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

3. Now, we calculate how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200:
   - They raise $700 per hour.
   - So, the number of hours needed to raise $4200 is $4200 ÷ $700 = 6 hours.

4. Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional 6 hours to find the total number of hours they need to fundraise:
   - Total hours = 3 hours + 6 hours = 9 hours.

So, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is 9 hours.

"To find out what percent of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. First, determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for all purposes, which is 40%.
2. Next, find out what percentage of this 40% is used for industrial purposes. Since 80% of the city's water use is for industrial purposes, we calculate 80% of 40%:
   \[
   0.80 \times 40\% = 32\%
   \]
   So, 32% of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes by the city.
3. To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, subtract the industrial use from the total use by the city:
   \[
   40\% - 32\% = 8\%
   \]

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how much ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours for both chocolate and vanilla flavors.

First, let's find out how much chocolate ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours:
- The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- In 1 hour, the factory makes \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).
- In 48 hours, the factory can make \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

Next, let's find out how much vanilla ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours:
- The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- In 1 hour, the factory makes \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).
- In 48 hours, the factory can make \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Now, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream made in 48 hours:

"First, let's find out how much Marcus spent on each type of item before the discount:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:
$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. To find the discount amount:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is:
$45.00"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50.
2. The deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2.

First, let's find out how many scoops Erin can get with $6.00 without considering the deal:
- $6.00 ÷ $1.50 per scoop = 4 scoops

Now, let's see how many scoops she can get with the deal:
- For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, for 4 scoops, she can get 2 free scoops.

So, if she buys 4 scoops, she gets 2 free scoops:
- 4 scoops + 2 free scoops = 6 scoops

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with her $6.00.

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 inches, which is 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. We can set up the equation:

\[ 100 = 9 \times \text{(length of Bobby's shoe)} + 10 \]

To find the length of Bobby's shoe, we first subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9 \times \text{(length of Bobby's shoe)} \]
\[ 90 = 9 \times \text{(length of Bobby's shoe)} \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ \text{length of Bobby's shoe} = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ \text{length of Bobby's shoe} = 10 \]

"To find out how many windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows:
- Windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 * 256 windows = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows:
- Windows smashed in teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 windows = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 windows (students) + 48 windows (teachers) = 112 windows.

"To find out what percent of Candy's spools are blue, we first need to find the total number of spools and the total number of blue spools.

The total number of blue spools is the sum of the light blue and dark blue spools:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 blue spools

Next, we find the total number of spools by adding all the spools together:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 spools

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and then multiply by 100:
(60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue.

40%"
"At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up to vote. By midday, 2/5 of these people had voted. 

To find out how many people voted by midday:
2/5 of 5000 = (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people

So, 2000 people voted by midday. This means the number of people who had not voted by midday is:
5000 - 2000 = 3000 people

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted. To find out how many people voted between midday and 16:00:
2/3 of 3000 = (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people

So, 2000 more people voted by 16:00. This means the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
3000 - 2000 = 1000 people

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
   - Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day.
   - For 30 days, he will chew \(4 \times 30 = 120\) pieces of gum.

2. Next, determine how many packs of gum are needed to get 120 pieces.
   - Each pack has 15 pieces of gum.
   - To find the number of packs, divide the total pieces by the number of pieces per pack: \(120 \div 15 = 8\).

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of smores needed:**
   - Each of the 9 kids wants 2 smores: \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
   - Each of the 6 adults wants 1 smore: \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
   - Total smores needed: \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

2. **Determine how many sleeves are needed:**
   - Each sleeve makes 8 smores.
   - To find out how many sleeves are needed for 24 smores: \(24 \div 8 = 3\) sleeves.

3. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**
   - There are 3 sleeves in a box.
   - Since 3 sleeves are needed and there are 3 sleeves per box, they will need \(3 \div 3 = 1\) box.

So, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"First, let's find out Dora's father's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice her age, we can calculate it as follows:

Dora's father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Dora's father's age = 30 + 8
Dora's father's age = 38

Next, we find out Dora's mother's age. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so:

Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4
Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4
Dora's mother's age = 34

Now, we add up the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother to get the total combined age:

Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"First, let's find out how many votes candidate A got. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we calculate:
20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes

Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B got. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. So, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:
50% of 20 = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes
So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes

Now, we know the total number of votes is 100. We can find out how many votes candidate C got by subtracting the votes of candidates A and B from the total votes:
100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 votes

So, candidate C got 50 votes.

"First, let's find out how many apples Beck has initially. Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. So, Beck has:

100 - 23 = 77 apples

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

100 - 10 = 90 apples

And Beck will have:

77 + 10 = 87 apples

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's apples from Boris's apples:

90 - 87 = 3

"First, let's figure out how much water Peter uses for each type of ice cube.

For the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- So, 3 giant cubes use \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces of water.

For the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- So, 7 medium cubes use \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces of water.

For the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- So, 8 small cubes use \(8 \times 0.5 = 4\) ounces of water.

Now, let's add up all the water used:
- Total water used = 12 ounces (giant) + 14 ounces (medium) + 4 ounces (small) = 30 ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. So, the water left is:
- Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces.

"First, we need to find out how many books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can write:

\[ 2 \times \text{Steven's books} = 20 \]

So, Steven has:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we know Alice has 6 more books than Steven. So, Alice has:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books, so:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

"First, we need to find out how much a half-gallon jar costs. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, if we subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar, we get the cost of a half-gallon jar:
$5 - $2 = $3

Now, we know the cost of a half-gallon jar is $3.

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:
10 gallon jars * $5 per gallon jar = $50

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:
16 half-gallon jars * $3 per half-gallon jar = $48

Finally, we add the total costs of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:
$50 + $48 = $98

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of students in the class:** 50
2. **Number of students who like to bake:** 10
3. **Number of students who like to play basketball:** 5

First, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for those who like to bake and play basketball:
\[ 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 \]

So, 35 students like to either play video games or play music.

Next, we know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]
So, 10 students like to play music.

Now, we can find out how many students like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to play music from the remaining students:
\[ 35 - 10 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:
25"
"First, we need to find out how many birds Jeremy scared away. He scared away 1/3 of 12 birds, which is 12 / 3 = 4 birds.

Next, we subtract the number of birds scared away from the original number of birds to find out how many were left. So, 12 - 4 = 8 birds remained.

Then, 20 more birds joined the 8 birds that were left. So, 8 + 20 = 28 birds are now in the backyard.

"To find out how many boys are in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many students are in each class. Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2:
   \[
   80 \div 2 = 40
   \]
   So, each class has 40 students.

2. Next, we need to find out how many girls are in each class. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find 40% of 40 students, we multiply 40 by 0.40:
   \[
   40 \times 0.40 = 16
   \]
   So, there are 16 girls in each class.

3. To find out how many boys are in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

"First, we need to find out how many animals Melissa has to groom in total. She has:

- 8 dogs
- 5 cats
- 3 birds
- 12 horses

Adding these together gives us the total number of animals:

8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals

Melissa is going to split these jobs evenly over the 5 days of the week. To find out how many animals she will groom each day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days:

28 ÷ 5 = 5.6

Since Melissa can't groom a fraction of an animal, we can say she will groom 6 animals on some days and 5 on others, but the average is 5.6 animals per day.

"To find out how much profit Mark made, we need to calculate his total expenses and his total earnings, then subtract the expenses from the earnings.

1. **Calculate total expenses:**
   - Mark buys 3 packs of magic cards.
   - Each pack costs $1800.
   - Total expenses = 3 packs * $1800/pack = $5400.

2. **Calculate total earnings:**
   - He gets 1 card worth $4000.
   - He gets another card worth $1000.
   - He also gets 30 more cards, each worth an average of $50.
   - Total value of the 30 cards = 30 cards * $50/card = $1500.
   - Total earnings = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

3. **Calculate profit:**
   - Profit = Total earnings - Total expenses
   - Profit = $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

So, Mark made a profit of $1100.

"To find out how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is 2 adults * $26/adult = $52
- The cost for 2 children is 2 children * $12/child = $24
- The total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is 2 adults * $14/adult = $28
- The cost for 2 children is 2 children * $10/child = $20
- The total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48

Now, we find the difference between the two total costs to see how much they save:
- The savings is $76 - $48 = $28

So, Jake's family will save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

"To find out how many chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends separately, and then add them together.

First, let's figure out the number of weekdays and weekends in two 4-week months:
- There are 4 weeks in a month, so in two months, there are 8 weeks.
- Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.

So, in 8 weeks:
- The number of weekdays is 8 weeks * 5 weekdays/week = 40 weekdays.
- The number of weekend days is 8 weeks * 2 weekend days/week = 16 weekend days.

Next, we calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends:
- On weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day. So, for 40 weekdays, the total is 60 chairs/day * 40 days = 2400 chairs.
- On weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. So, for 16 weekend days, the total is 100 chairs/day * 16 days = 1600 chairs.

Finally, we add the chairs rented on weekdays and weekends to get the total:
- Total chairs rented = 2400 chairs (weekdays) + 1600 chairs (weekends) = 4000 chairs.

"First, let's figure out how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:

30 small stickers * 90% = 27 small stickers

Since 1 large button is worth 3 small stickers, the 27 small stickers can be traded for:

27 small stickers / 3 small stickers per large button = 9 large buttons

Next, let's see how many large stickers she trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

40 large stickers * 50% = 20 large stickers

Since 1 large sticker is worth 1 large button, she gets:

20 large stickers = 20 large buttons

Now, she has 20 large stickers left, which she trades for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets:

20 large stickers * 3 small buttons per large sticker = 60 small buttons

Now, let's add up all the buttons she has. She has 9 large buttons from the small stickers and 20 large buttons from the large stickers, which totals:

9 large buttons + 20 large buttons = 29 large buttons

She also has 60 small buttons from the remaining large stickers. 

So, the total number of buttons she has by the end is:

29 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 89 buttons

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is \( x \).
2. According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, so the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \).
3. The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is also 33.
4. Therefore, the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against is 33. This can be written as:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house is \( x \).
2. The first house needs half of what the second house needs, so it will need \( \frac{x}{2} \) cases.
3. The third house needs double what the first house needs, so it will need \( 2 \times \frac{x}{2} = x \) cases.

Now, we know the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250 \]

To make it easier to solve, we can multiply everything by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

\[ x + 4x = 500 \]

\[ 5x = 500 \]

Now, divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = 100 \]

So, the third house, which needs \( x \) cases, will need 100 cases of shingles.

"First, let's find out how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so:
20 eggplants * $3/eggplant = $60

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. He has already made $60 from the eggplants, so he needs to make:
$135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he needs to sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from the corn by the number of ears of corn:
$75 / 25 ears of corn = $3 per ear of corn

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find out how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of rides on the usual days:**
   - They ride 3 times a day for 5 days.
   - So, \(3 \times 5 = 15\) rides.

2. **Calculate the number of rides on the special days:**
   - On 2 other days, they ride twice as many times as on the usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides per day is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) rides per day.
   - So, for 2 days, \(6 \times 2 = 12\) rides.

3. **Add the rides from the usual days and the special days:**
   - Total rides in a week = rides on usual days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = \(15 + 12 = 27\)

So, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's say he bought \( x \) white fish and \( 17 - x \) orange fish.

3. **Final Fish Count:**
   - After adding the new fish, the total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \).
   - The total number of orange fish is \( 3 + (17 - x) = 20 - x \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.
   - This can be written as: \( 20 - x = 2(4 + x) \).

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - \( 20 - x = 8 + 2x \)
   - Combine like terms: \( 20 - 8 = 2x + x \)
   - \( 12 = 3x \)
   - \( x = 4 \)

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
3. Calculate the total amount paid over three months.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.**

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees each month. Over three months, the number of new employees hired is:
20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 employees

So, the total number of employees after three months is:
200 initial employees + 60 new employees = 260 employees

**Step 2: Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary for 260 employees is:
260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid over three months.**

The total amount paid over three months is:
$1,040,000/month * 3 months = $3,120,000

"To find out how long the choir will be caroling, we need to add up the time for all the songs they plan to sing. 

First, we calculate the total time for singing ""Deck the Halls"" twice:
150 seconds (for one song) × 2 = 300 seconds

Next, we add the time for singing ""Jingle Bells"" once:
240 seconds

Now, we add the time for ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells"" together:
300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds

So, the total time the choir will be caroling is 540 seconds.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Billy's Starting Salary:**
   - Billy started at $10 per hour.

2. **Billy's Salary After 2 Months:**
   - He received a raise of $0.50 per hour.
   - New salary: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

3. **Billy's Salary on His First Anniversary:**
   - He received another raise of $1.00 per hour.
   - New salary: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

4. **Sally's Starting Salary:**
   - Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
   - Sally's starting salary: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

5. **Earnings Calculation:**
   - Both Billy and Sally work 20 hours.
   - Billy's earnings: $11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230.
   - Sally's earnings: $10.50 per hour * 20 hours = $210.

6. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - Difference: $230 - $210 = $20.

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally.

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together gives:
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals.

Let's say Bubbles buys \( x \) stuffed goats. After buying the goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. This can be written as:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"First, let's figure out how many days are in 2 weeks and 1 week:
- 2 weeks = 14 days
- 1 week = 7 days

Next, we calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks:
- Half an hour every day for 14 days = 0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours

Then, we calculate the total hours Kris plays in the next week:
- 2 hours every day for 7 days = 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours

Now, we add the hours from both periods to find the total hours Kris has played:
- Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required:
- Hours still needed = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

"To find out how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Calculate the distance the first car travels:**
   - The first car travels at 60 miles per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the distance it travels is \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Calculate the distance the second car travels:**
   - The second car travels at 70 miles per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the distance it travels is \( 70 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Find the difference in the distances:**
   - The difference is \( 140 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles} \).

So, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
   - Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
   - Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
   - Since Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
   - The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
   - The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

2. **Express all quantities in terms of \( z \):**
   - Since \( s = 2z \), the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces.
   - The amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.
   - The amount of oil is \( 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \) ounces.

3. **Set up the equation for the total amount:**
   - The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     10z = 10
     \]

4. **Solve for \( z \):**
   - Divide both sides by 10:
     \[
     z = 1
     \]

5. **Find the amount of oil:**
   - The amount of oil is \( 4z \):
     \[
     4z = 4 \times 1 = 4

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say PJ has \( x \) cards.
2. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has \( 3x \) cards.
3. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3x + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7x = 341 - 12 \]
\[ 7x = 329 \]
\[ x = \frac{329}{7} \]
\[ x = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \( 3x = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to add up the production from the first three weeks and then subtract that total from the monthly production.

1. First week production: 8,000 bars
2. Second week production: 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
3. Third week production: 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Now, let's add the production from the first three weeks:
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, so the production for the fourth week is:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

"To find out how much it will cost Angela, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items she needs installed beyond what is included in the basic installation package.

The basic installation package includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Angela has:
- 6 mirrors (2 more than included)
- 2 chandeliers (1 more than included)
- 20 pictures (10 more than included)

The additional items Angela needs installed are:
- 2 extra mirrors
- 1 extra chandelier
- 10 extra pictures

Each additional item costs $15.00. So, we calculate the cost of the additional items:
- 2 extra mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- 1 extra chandelier: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- 10 extra pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Total cost for additional items:
$30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Now, we add the cost of the basic installation to the cost of the additional items:
$129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

So, the total cost for Angela will be:
$324.00

"First, let's find out how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $30.00

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more Roy has saved, we calculate 40% of Anthony's savings:

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.40 × $30.00
40% of Anthony's savings = $12.00

Now, we add this amount to Anthony's savings to find out how much Roy has saved:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00
Roy's savings = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how high each person can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working our way up to Naruto.

1. **Pompei** can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. **Saskay** can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Kagiyami** can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. **Naruto** can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami:
   \[
   10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we need to convert 480 inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
\[
480 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet}
\]

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"Mason travels at a speed of 8 miles per hour. First, he rides for 4 hours, so he covers:
8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

After resting, he rides for another 6 hours, covering:
8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

To find the total distance, we add the two distances together:
32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance is the same for all animals.
   - The speed of the kangaroos is not directly given, but we can use the total time and the number of kangaroos to understand the relationship.

2. **Calculate the total work done by the kangaroos:**
   - The total work (distance) can be considered as the product of the number of kangaroos and the time they take.
   - Total work = 3 kangaroos * 18 hours = 54 kangaroo-hours.

3. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.
   - Therefore, one turtle would take twice as long as one kangaroo to cover the same distance.

4. **Calculate the total time for the turtles:**
   - If one turtle takes twice as long as one kangaroo, then the total time for 4 turtles to cover the same distance can be calculated by considering the total work in turtle-hours.
   - Total work in turtle-hours = 54 kangaroo-hours * 2 (since each turtle is half as fast) = 108 turtle-hours.
   - Since there are 4 turtles, the time taken by 4 turtles is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{108 \text{ turtle-hours}}{4 \text{ turtles}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

So, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The original price of the new laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in value of her old laptop is $200, so the new price of the laptop after the trade-in is:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400
   \]
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Let's add up the money Erika has from her job and her mom:
\[
150 + 80 = 230
\]

Now, let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of the money in her purse, the money from her job, and the money from her mom:
\[
x + 230
\]

We know that this total amount is $50 less than the price of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[
x + 230 = 400 - 50
\]

Simplify the right side:
\[
x + 230 = 350
\]

To find \( x \), subtract 230 from both sides:
\[
x = 350 - 230
\]
\[
x = 120
\]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[
120

"First, let's figure out how many slices Adam gets from the large apples. Since a large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and he slices 3 large apples, he gets:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices from large apples.

Next, let's calculate the slices from the small apples. A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and he slices 5 small apples, so he gets:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices from small apples.

Now, let's add the slices from the large and small apples to find the total number of slices:
15 slices from large apples + 15 slices from small apples = 30 slices in total.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 total slices - 15 slices eaten = 15 slices left.

"To find out how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, let's break it down step by step:

1. The farmer currently has 3 cows.
2. Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
3. So, the total milk produced by 3 cows is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters a day.
4. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day.
5. The difference between the desired amount and the current amount is \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters.
6. Since each cow produces 5 liters, the number of additional cows needed to produce 10 more liters is \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows.

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}

Now, we add the remaining lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:

"Let's use some simple math to figure this out. 

1. Let's say my age is \( x \).
2. My brother is 3 years older than me, so his age is \( x + 3 \).
3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is \( x - 2 \).
4. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

Now, we know that the sum of all our ages is 87. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87 \]

Let's simplify this step by step:

1. Combine like terms:

To find out how many oranges Jennifer has left, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the original number of oranges:

12 oranges - 9 oranges = 3 oranges

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge every month.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Claire earns: 
     \[
     1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges}
     \]

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Therefore, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Amber earns:
     \[
     \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges}
     \]

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - In 1 year, Wendy earns:
     \[
     3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges}
     \]

4. **Difference in Badge Earnings:**
   - To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract Amber's total from Wendy's total:
     \[
     36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges}
     \]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
2. Determine how many loaves she baked in that time.
3. Calculate the total number of slices from all the loaves.
4. Find out how much money she made by selling all the slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.**
Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. That's 5 hours.

**Step 2: Determine how many loaves she baked in that time.**
Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour. So, in 5 hours, she baked:
2 loaves/hour × 5 hours = 10 loaves

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices from all the loaves.**
Each loaf is cut into 8 slices. So, from 10 loaves, she gets:
10 loaves × 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices

**Step 4: Find out how much money she made by selling all the slices.**
Each slice is sold for 50 cents. So, for 80 slices, she made:
80 slices × $0.50/slice = $40

So, Paige raised $40.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say Fawn has \( F \) books.
2. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
3. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 \) books, which simplifies to \( F + 13 \) books.

Together, they have 85 books, so we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Now, let's solve for \( F \):
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Madeline pays per month.
2. Calculate the total amount Keenan pays per month.
3. Divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4 to find the weekly amount.

First, we know that Madeline pays 60% of the total monthly cost. The total monthly cost is $400.

Madeline's monthly payment:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

Since the total cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining amount:
\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \]

Keenan's monthly payment is $160. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly payment by 4:
\[ 160 \div 4 = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

"To find out how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Since the profit is the total revenue minus the cost, we can find the cost by subtracting the profit from the total revenue.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them.
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
Each chicken is sold for $50.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the chickens.
Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000.
\[ \text{Cost} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000.

"First, we need to find out how much money Sarah will get from selling her rope. The rope is 20 meters long and her friend is buying it for $2 a meter. So, we multiply 20 meters by $2:

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Next, we need to find out how much rope Sarah can buy with the $40 at the store, where the price is $1.5 a meter. We divide the total money by the price per meter:

$40 / $1.5/meter = 26.67 meters

Since Sarah can't buy a fraction of a meter of rope, she can buy 26 meters of rope. Now, we calculate the cost of 26 meters of rope:

26 meters * $1.5/meter = $39

Finally, we find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope by subtracting the cost of the new rope from the total money she got from selling her old rope:

$40 - $39 = $1

So, Sarah will have $1 left over.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Melanie's current age:**
   - We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.
   - So, her current age is \( 18 - 10 = 8 \) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for when her age will be three times her current age:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age.
   - In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \).
   - We want this age to be three times her current age, which is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \).

3. **Write the equation and solve for \( x \):**
   - The equation is \( 8 + x = 24 \).
   - Subtract 8 from both sides: \( x = 24 - 8 \).
   - So, \( x = 16 \).

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"First, let's find out how much each pack of bacon costs:
- 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so each pack of bacon costs $10 ÷ 5 = $2.

Next, we calculate the cost of each packet of chicken:
- Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $2 × 2 = $4.

Now, let's find out the total cost of the chicken:
- Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for the chicken is 6 × $4 = $24.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the strawberries:
- Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost for the strawberries is 3 × $4 = $12.

Now, let's find out the cost of each pack of apples:
- Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 ÷ 2 = $2.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for the apples is 7 × $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount Kelly has spent:
- Total cost of bacon: $10
- Total cost of chicken: $24
- Total cost of strawberries: $12
- Total cost of apples: $14

Total amount spent = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from Kelly's budget to find out how much money she has left:
- Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount left is $65 - $60 = $5.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total earnings and the amount earned from mowing lawns:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.

2. **Determine how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn:**
   - Let's say Tasha mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times.
   - Therefore, she earned \( 6x \) dollars from mowing Joe's lawn.

3. **Calculate the earnings from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns:**
   - Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
   - Tasha mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.
   - Assuming the payment for mowing each lawn is the same, the total earnings from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns would be \( 6 \times 3x + 6 \times 5x = 18x + 30x = 48x \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns = Earnings from Joe's lawn + Earnings from Kamala's lawn + Earnings from Alba's lawn
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 6x + 48x = 54x \) dollars.

5. **Determine the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from mowing lawns + Earnings from lemonade sales
   - $80 = 54x + \text{Earnings from lemonade sales}
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - 54x

6. **Find the value of \( x \):**
   - Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn, and we know the total earnings from mowing lawns is \( 54x \), we need to find \( x \) such that the total earnings from mowing lawns is a reasonable part of $80.
   - If \( x = 1 \), then \( 54x = 54 \), which is less than $80.
   - Therefore, \( x = 1 \) is a reasonable value.

7. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - 54 \times 1 = $80 - 54 = $26

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

"First, let's find out Carl's weight. Since Carl’s weight is 16 kg more than Martin’s weight:
Carl’s weight = Martin’s weight + 16 kg
Carl’s weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl’s weight = 71 kg

Next, let's find out Christian’s weight. Since Christian’s weight is 8 kg more than Carl’s weight:
Christian’s weight = Carl’s weight + 8 kg
Christian’s weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian’s weight = 79 kg

Now, let's find out Harry’s weight. Since Harry is 5 kg less than Christian’s weight:
Harry’s weight = Christian’s weight - 5 kg
Harry’s weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry’s weight = 74 kg

"To find out how many miles Anis rowed, we need to calculate 1/5 times more than what Dijana rowed and then add that to Dijana's distance.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

1/5 of 50 miles is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance both of them rowed, we add Dijana's and Anis's distances together:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pages Denise read today.
2. Add the pages Denise read yesterday and today to get the total pages she read.
3. Add the pages Daniel read yesterday and today to get the total pages he read.
4. Subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read to find the difference.

Step 1: Denise read 5 more pages today than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read:
\[ 13 + 5 = 18 \text{ pages today} \]

Step 2: Total pages Denise read:
\[ 10 \text{ (yesterday)} + 18 \text{ (today)} = 28 \text{ pages} \]

Step 3: Total pages Daniel read:
\[ 13 \text{ (yesterday)} + 0 \text{ (today)} = 13 \text{ pages} \]

Step 4: Difference in the number of pages read:
\[ 28 - 13 = 15 \]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since he is eating with his adult wife and their two children, we need to figure out how much soup is left after they all have one bowl each for dinner.

1. First, we calculate the total number of bowls needed for dinner:
   - 2 adult bowls (Calvin and his wife)
   - 2 child bowls (for the children)
   - Total bowls needed = 2 (adult) + 2 (child) = 4 bowls

2. Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, and they are using 4 bowls in total (2 adult and 2 child), there will be no soup left over from the dinner.

3. However, the question asks how many times each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup. Since there is no leftover soup after dinner, the children will not be able to have any additional bowls of soup for lunch.

"To find out how much William spent in all, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

First, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- William bought 5 notebooks.
- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- So, the total cost for the notebooks is \( 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- William bought 1 ballpen.
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.
- So, the total cost for the ballpen is \( 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:
- Total cost = Cost of notebooks + Cost of ballpen
- Total cost = \( 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \) dollars.

So, William spent a total of $8.00.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we can break this down into two parts: the material needed for the small masks and the material needed for the large masks.

1. **Material for small masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - To find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4 masks: 
     \[ \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \]
   - For 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for one mask by 20:
     \[ 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} \times 20 \text{ masks} = 10 \text{ yards} \]

2. **Material for large masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - To find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3 masks:
     \[ \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \]
   - For 8 large masks, we multiply the material needed for one mask by 8:
     \[ 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} \times 8 \text{ masks} = 6 \text{ yards} \]

3. **Total material needed:**
   - Add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks:
     \[ 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \]

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on different activities and subtract that from 24 hours, which is the total number of hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the hours spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total hours spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

To find the free time, we subtract the total hours spent on activities from 24 hours:
24 - 19 = 5 hours

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Duncan's age eight years ago:**
   - Duncan's current age is 60.
   - Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).

2. **Set up the relationship between Duncan's age eight years ago and Adam's age four years ago:**
   - According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago.
   - Let \( A \) be Adam's current age.
   - Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
   - The relationship can be written as: \( 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \).

3. **Solve for Adam's current age:**
   - First, divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     52 \div 2 = A - 4
     \]
     \[
     26 = A - 4
     \]
   - Next, add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
     \[
     26 + 4 = A
     \]
     \[
     A = 30
     \]

4. **Determine Adam's age in 8 years:**
   - Adam's current age is 30.
   - In 8 years, Adam's age will be \( 30 + 8 = 38 \).

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To find out how many acres the two farms have together, we first need to figure out how big each farm is.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm. So, we calculate twice Farmer Brown's farm:
200 acres * 2 = 400 acres

Then we add 100 acres to that:
400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres

Now, we add the sizes of both farms together:
200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres

So, the two farms together have 700 acres.

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to add up all the expenses they had and then divide by 2, since the total amount was split equally between Julia and Nadine.

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of 1 dozen (12) balloons, at $0.5 for 2 balloons, is calculated as follows:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 sets of 2 balloons
   - 6 sets * $0.5 = $3
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream, at $7 each, is:
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, we add all the costs together:
- $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28

Since this total amount of $28 was the combined allowance of Julia and Nadine, we divide it by 2 to find out how much each one received:
- $28 / 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Step 1: Total number of lollipops sold
Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students.
Total lollipops sold = 10 lollipops/student * 30 students = 300 lollipops

Step 2: Total revenue from selling the lollipops
Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240

Step 3: Total cost of buying the lollipops
Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

Step 4: Calculate the profit
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

So, the tank starts with 5,000 gallons of water.

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3,000 gallons

Now, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find out how much is left:

5,000 gallons - 3,000 gallons = 2,000 gallons

So, after 6 days, there will be 2,000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

"To find out how many calories the pastries Andrew baked have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin.
3. Multiply the calories of a mini cinnamon roll by the number of mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Multiply the calories of a mini blueberry muffin by the number of mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

First, let's calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- So, a mini cinnamon roll has \(600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200\) calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- So, a mini blueberry muffin has \(450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150\) calories.

Now, let's find the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls:
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- Each mini cinnamon roll has 200 calories.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \(200 \times 200 = 40,000\) calories.

Next, let's find the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins:
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- Each mini blueberry muffin has 150 calories.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \(300 \times 150 = 45,000\) calories.

Finally, let's add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday.**
   - Monday: 39 Junebugs
   - Tuesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
   - Wednesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
   - Thursday: 48 Junebugs
   - Friday: 57 Junebugs

2. **Add up all the Junebugs removed:**
   \[
   39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
   \]

3. **Perform the addition:**
   \[
   39 + 78 = 117
   \]
   \[
   117 + 78 = 195
   \]
   \[
   195 + 48 = 243
   \]
   \[
   243 + 57 = 300
   \]

4. **Count the number of days:**
   - There are 5 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday).

5. **Calculate the average:**
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of Junebugs}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
   \]

So, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is:

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each one traveled.

1. **Distance traveled by the bus:**
   - Speed of the bus = 60 miles per hour
   - Time traveled by the bus = 5 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the car:**
   - Speed of the car = 30 miles per hour
   - Time traveled by the car = 8 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

3. **Difference in distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car
   - 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the other toys and then subtract that number from the total number of toys.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

First, we add these numbers together:
31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls there are, we subtract the number of other toys from the total number of toys:
62 - 48 = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say John's age is \( J \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than John, so Paul's age is \( J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is \( J + (J + 10) = 2J + 10 \).

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years:
\[ J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( J \):
\[ J + J + 10 + 2J + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we know John's age is 20, we can find Peter's age:
\[ \text{Peter's age} = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, Peter's age is 50.

"First, let's figure out how many people are playing the water balloon fight. Maria invited 4 friends, and she is also playing, so there are 5 people in total.

At the start, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. So, the friends have:
4 friends × 2 balloons each = 8 balloons

Maria had 1 water balloon for herself, so the total at the start is:
8 balloons (friends) + 1 balloon (Maria) = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people × 3 balloons each = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 balloons (initial) + 15 balloons (additional) = 24 balloons

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:
24

"To find out how many children can be in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows, and then multiply that by the number of schools.

1. First, we find out how many children are in one set of rows for one school:
   - There are 8 children in a row.
   - There are 7 rows.
   - So, for one school, the number of children is \(8 \times 7 = 56\).

2. Next, we find out how many children are there in total for all 5 schools:
   - There are 56 children per school.
   - There are 5 schools.
   - So, the total number of children is \(56 \times 5 = 280\).

"First, let's figure out how much James paid for the CDs after the discount.

1. The original cost of each CD is $15.
2. The discount is 40%, so he pays 60% of the original price (100% - 40% = 60%).
3. 60% of $15 is calculated as \( 15 \times 0.60 = 9 \) dollars per CD.
4. James buys 10 CDs, so the total cost is \( 10 \times 9 = 90 \) dollars.

Next, let's figure out how much he gets back from selling 5 of the CDs.

1. He sells 5 CDs for $40 in total.

Now, let's calculate how much money he was out.

"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then add them all together.

1. For the yams:
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam is sold at $1.5.
   - Total from yams = 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.

2. For the sweet potatoes:
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato is sold at $2.
   - Total from sweet potatoes = 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.

3. For the carrots:
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold at $1.25.
   - Total from carrots = 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.

Now, we add the totals from each type of root crop to find the total earnings:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time for each part of James's journey.

1. **Swimming the first part:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.
   - James swims at a speed of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time to swim 12 miles is \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming the first part.
   - Rest time is \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

3. **Swimming the remaining part:**
   - The remaining distance is \( 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \) miles.
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \).
   - Time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time is the sum of the time spent swimming the first part, resting, and swimming the remaining part.
   - Total time = 6 hours (first part) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (remaining part) = 17 hours.

"To find out how much commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission for each type of newspaper and then add them together.

1. **New York Times:**
   - Each copy costs $5.
   - Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
   - He sells 6 copies.
   - Total commission from New York Times = 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

2. **Wall Street Journal:**
   - Each copy costs $15.
   - Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
   - He sells 10 copies.
   - Total commission from Wall Street Journal = 10 * $1.20 = $12.00.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. We know that the total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45.
2. Bahati scored the most points, 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.

Let's use \( A \) to represent the points scored by Azibo.

- Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points.
- Bahati also scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar scored \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \) points.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total points:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the total number of holes on the island by the end of the fourth day.
3. Use the information that the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day.
4. Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

Let's start with step 1:

- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes.

Total holes by the end of the third day:
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 6 (third day) = 29 holes

Step 2 and 3:
The total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day. The number of holes dug by the end of the first day is 10.

So, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
4 * 10 = 40 holes

Step 4:
To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes by the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
40 (total by end of fourth day) - 29 (total by end of third day) = 11 holes

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The cost of the supplies is $400.

50% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 400 \times 0.50 = 200 \]

So, the total cost for the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

The travel costs $600.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
   - Let \( X \) be the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Together they have caught 339 Pokemon: 
     \[
     A + S + X = 339
     \]
   - Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
     \[
     X = S + 5
     \]
   - Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
     \[
     S = 4A - 13
     \]

3. **Substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) into the total equation:**
   - From \( X = S + 5 \), we can substitute \( X \) in the total equation:
     \[
     A + S + (S + 5) = 339
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     A + 2S + 5 = 339
     \]
   - Subtract 5 from both sides:
     \[
     A + 2S = 334
     \]

4. **Substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):**
   - Replace \( S \) with \( 4A - 13 \):
     \[
     A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
     \]
   - Simplify inside the parentheses:
     \[
     A + 8A - 26 = 334
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     9A - 26 = 334
     \]
   - Add 26 to both sides:
     \[
     9A = 360
     \]
   - Divide by 9:
     \[
     A = 40
     \]

5. **Find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):**
   - Substitute \( A = 40 \):
     \[
     S = 4(40) - 13
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     S = 160 - 13
     \]
     \[
     S = 147
     \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of episodes in the show.
2. Calculate the total time spent watching all episodes.

First, we know each episode is 20 minutes long. The problem states there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. So, we calculate the number of episodes:

Number of episodes = 20 minutes per episode / 2 = 10 episodes

Next, we calculate the total time spent watching all episodes:

Total time = Number of episodes × Length of each episode
Total time = 10 episodes × 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in the southward direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northward direction.

1. **Southward travel:**
   - First part: The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour.
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - Third part: The bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour.
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - Total southward distance:
     \[
     300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Northward travel:**
   - Second part: The bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour.
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Net distance traveled:**
   - Subtract the northward distance from the southward distance:
     \[
     410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
     \]

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had at the start of the day.
2. Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party.

First, let's convert all the quantities to individual brownies (1 dozen = 12 brownies):

- Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
- She brought home 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
- Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.

Now, add these amounts to find the total number of brownies Greta had initially:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Next, we need to subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party:
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten: \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\) brownies.

Subtract the eaten brownies from the total:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

So, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
48"
"To find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we need to calculate each of their ages first.

1. Nani's age: 8 years old.
2. Nani's brother's age: Since he is twice Nani's age, we calculate:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Nani's sister's age: She is 25% younger than Nani. First, we find 25% of Nani's age:
   \[
   0.25 \times 8 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]
   Then, we subtract this from Nani's age to find the sister's age:
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old}
   \]

Now, we add up the ages of all three:
\[
8 + 16 + 6 = 30

"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of stringing and then add them all together.

1. **Synthetic Gut:**
   - Number of racquets: 3
   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time for synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes

2. **Polyester String:**
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time for polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes

3. **Hybrid Set:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time for hybrid set: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, we add up all the times:
- Total time = 45 minutes (synthetic gut) + 110 minutes (polyester) + 72 minutes (hybrid)
- Total time = 227 minutes

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. John is buying 4 phones in total (1 for himself, 1 for his wife, and 1 each for his 2 kids).

2. The price of each phone is $600.

3. The first 2 phones are at full price, so:
   - Cost of the first phone: $600
   - Cost of the second phone: $600

4. The remaining 2 phones are half price, so:
   - Cost of the third phone: $600 / 2 = $300
   - Cost of the fourth phone: $600 / 2 = $300

5. Now, add up the costs of all the phones:
   - Total cost = $600 + $600 + $300 + $300 = $1800

So, John paid a total of $1800 for all the phones.

"To find out how many players are in both teams combined, we first need to figure out how many players are on Zeke's team. 

We know that Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. So, we add 7 to the number of players on Carlton's team:

13 players + 7 players = 20 players

This means Zeke's team has 20 players. Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players on Carlton's team to the number of players on Zeke's team:

13 players + 20 players = 33 players

So, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33.

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the total length of the fence he is building. Since the fence is rectangular, we can find the perimeter by adding up all the sides.

The length of the fence is 15 feet, and the width is 10 feet. A rectangle has two lengths and two widths, so the total perimeter (P) is calculated as:
\[ P = 2 \times \text{length} + 2 \times \text{width} \]
\[ P = 2 \times 15 + 2 \times 10 \]
\[ P = 30 + 20 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. So, the total number of wood slats (S) he needs is:
\[ S = 2 \times \text{perimeter} \]
\[ S = 2 \times 50 \]
\[ S = 100 \]

"First, let's figure out how many boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington has after giving some away.

She started with 12 boxes and gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. So, she gave away a total of:
2 + 2 = 4 boxes

Now, subtract the boxes she gave away from the total she bought:
12 - 4 = 8 boxes

Next, Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges. To find out how many boxes that is, we calculate:
1/4 of 8 boxes = 8 / 4 = 2 boxes

So, she kept 2 boxes and sold the rest. The number of boxes she sold is:
8 - 2 = 6 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges

Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost of the books:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs $25 more. Since he earns $5 per hour, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours.

"First, let's figure out how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more than Richard. So, if we subtract 10 from the number of cherries Robert has, we get the number of cherries Richard has:
30 - 10 = 20 cherries for Richard.

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Robert and Richard have from the total:
60 - 30 (Robert's cherries) - 20 (Richard's cherries) = 10 cherries for Jerry.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:
30 (Robert's cherries) - 10 (Jerry's cherries) = 20.

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To find out how much Sunny earned over the two days, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boxes sold each day:**
   - On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
   - On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so:
     \[
     10 + 5 = 15 \text{ boxes of gingerbread on Sunday}
     \]
   - On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie, so:
     \[
     15 - 4 = 11 \text{ boxes of apple pie on Saturday}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes sold over the two days:**
   - Total gingerbread boxes:
     \[
     10 \text{ (Saturday)} + 15 \text{ (Sunday)} = 25 \text{ boxes}
     \]
   - Total apple pie boxes:
     \[
     11 \text{ (Saturday)} + 15 \text{ (Sunday)} = 26 \text{ boxes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Earnings from gingerbread:
     \[
     25 \text{ boxes} \times 6 \text{ dollars/box} = 150 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Earnings from apple pie:
     \[
     26 \text{ boxes} \times 15 \text{ dollars/box} = 390 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total earnings for two days:**

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used per day:**
   - Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She is outside for 4 hours a day.
   - So, she uses \( 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \).

2. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over the 8 days:**
   - She uses 4 ounces of sunscreen each day.
   - She is on vacation for 8 days.
   - So, she uses \( 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \).

3. **Determine how many bottles of sunscreen are needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
   - She needs 32 ounces in total.
   - So, she needs \( \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \).

"If the blue car costs $100, and the red car is 40% cheaper, we first find out how much 40% of $100 is:

40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Now, we subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:

$100 - $40 = $60

The red car costs $60. Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car together:

$100 + $60 = $160

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Emil's Current Age:**
   Emil is currently 19 years old.

2. **Emil's Age When He Turns 24:**
   When Emil turns 24, he will be 24 years old. This will happen in 5 years (24 - 19 = 5).

3. **Dad's Age When Emil Turns 24:**
   At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad. So, if Emil is 24, his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

4. **Dad's Current Age:**
   Since this will happen in 5 years, we need to find out how old Emil's dad is now. 
   Dad's current age = 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

5. **Brother's Age When Emil Turns 24:**
   At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother. So, if Emil is 24, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

6. **Brother's Current Age:**
   Since this will happen in 5 years, we need to find out how old Emil's brother is now.
   Brother's current age = 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

7. **Sum of Dad's and Brother's Current Ages:**
   Dad's current age + Brother's current age = 43 + 7 = 50.

So, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50.

30 - 6 = 24 students remaining.

Out of these remaining students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So we calculate:
25% of 24 = 0.25 × 24 = 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

So, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many flowers Pat can fit in her flower bed and how many more she needs to buy.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the flower bed is measured in feet, we'll convert the width of the flowers from inches to feet:
12 inches = 1 foot

Each flower needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next flower. So, the total space each flower needs (including the space between them) is:
1 foot (width of the flower) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet

Next, we calculate how many flowers can fit in the 111-foot flower bed:
111 feet / 2.5 feet per flower = 44.4 flowers

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a flower, we round down to the nearest whole number:
44 flowers

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:
44 flowers - 17 flowers = 27 flowers

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost for 27 flowers is:
27 flowers * $6 per flower = $162

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

This means Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day.

Next, to find out how many pretzels he eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by the number of days in a week:
\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

- The cost of 3 petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00 per petunia = $9.00
- The cost of 2 sweet potato vines: 2 vines * $2.50 per vine = $5.00

Now, add the costs for the petunias and the sweet potato vines to get the total cost for one basket:
- Total cost for one basket = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, we multiply the cost of one basket by 5:
- Total cost for 5 baskets = $14.00 * 5 = $70.00

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

"First, let's figure out how much soil is used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. So, the soil left for the roses is:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses they can plant is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break the problem into two parts: peeling and cooking.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can peel per minute.
   - \( 90 \div 6 = 15 \) minutes.

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can cook in one batch, and then multiply by the time it takes to cook one batch.
   - \( 90 \div 30 = 3 \) batches.
   - \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - Add the time it takes to peel the shrimp to the time it takes to cook the shrimp.
   - \( 15 + 30 = 45 \) minutes.

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, it will cool the room by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, it will cool the room by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Total cooling:**
   - The total cooling effect is \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.

4. **Warming up for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, it will warm up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

5. **Net temperature change:**
   - The net change in temperature is the total cooling minus the warming.
   - Net change = \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Three times the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time difference between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we need to find out how old Bill was 75 years before he was 90.
   - \(90 - 75 = 15\)

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to add up all the checks he writes for each of his expenses.

1. **Electric bill**: 1 check per month
   - 1 check/month × 12 months/year = 12 checks/year

2. **Gas bill**: 1 check per month
   - 1 check/month × 12 months/year = 12 checks/year

3. **Church**: 2 checks per month
   - 2 checks/month × 12 months/year = 24 checks/year

4. **Pest and lawn service**: 1 check per quarter
   - 1 check/quarter × 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year

Now, we add all these checks together:
- 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks/year

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of trips the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips.

2. **Calculate the number of trips to Greece:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of trips to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips.

3. **Calculate the number of trips to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.
   - Since these 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, the number of trips to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) trips.

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Add the amounts given by his mother and father to find the total amount given by his parents:
   \[
   6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings:
   \[
   30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Adam had to contribute 12 dollars from his savings.

"To find Wilfred's age, let's first figure out the average age of the group and then use that information to find Helene's age. After that, we can determine Wilfred's age.

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

3. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. So, Helene's age is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

4. We know the ages of Akbar (3 years), Alessandro (4 years), and Helene (10 years). To find Wilfred's age, we subtract the sum of the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age of the group.

5. The sum of the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene is \(3 + 4 + 10 = 17\).

6. Therefore, Wilfred's age is \(20 - 17 = 3\).

"First, let's find out how many cookies there were in total at the wedding. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies.

100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church. So, we need to find half of 1500 cookies.

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

These 750 cookies were given to the people at the church, and each person got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were at the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

So, the number of people in the church next door is 50.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of slices:**
   - Let's say each kid gets 1 slice.
   - Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, each adult gets 2 slices.
   - There are 4 kids, so the kids together get \(4 \times 1 = 4\) slices.
   - There are 2 adults, so the adults together get \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices is \(4 + 4 = 8\) slices.

2. **Calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets:**
   - Each adult gets 2 slices.
   - The total number of slices is 8.
   - The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is \(\frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = 25\%\).

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract this from his total working hours.

1. **Time spent on rounds:**
   - Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients.
   - Each inpatient check takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. **Time spent on appointments:**
   - Doctor Jones has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

3. **Total time spent on rounds and appointments:**
   - Total time = 180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes.

4. **Convert total time spent to hours:**
   - 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

5. **Time left for updating records:**
   - Doctor Jones works 9 hours in total.

"To find out the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time required for each step and then subtract that total from 5:00 pm.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (which is 120 minutes)
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add all these times together:
20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

180 minutes is the same as 3 hours.

So, Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the cake from start to finish. If she wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, she should start 3 hours before that time.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm at the latest.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can start by adding the number of boxes Lisa and Peter sold together. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. So, together they sold:

3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in one box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes sold:

64 ÷ 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To find out how much the dance studio earns in a month, we need to calculate the total cost and then the earnings. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Calculate the cost to rent the studio per session:**
   - The studio costs $25 to rent per session.

2. **Calculate the cost per student per session:**
   - Each student costs $1.50 per session.
   - With 10 students, the total cost for students per session is \( 10 \times 1.50 = 15 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost per session:**
   - The total cost per session is the sum of the rental cost and the student cost.
   - Total cost per session = \( 25 + 15 = 40 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total cost per week:**
   - The studio is rented 3 days a week.
   - Total cost per week = \( 40 \times 3 = 120 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total cost per month:**
   - Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the total cost per month is \( 120 \times 4 = 480 \) dollars.

Since the question asks for the expected earnings, and we have calculated the total cost, the expected earnings would be the negative of the total cost (as it's an expense).

However, if the question is asking for the total amount spent (which is the same as the cost in this context), the answer is:

"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:**
   - Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars.
   - Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = Total chocolate bars / Number of boxes
   - Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = 64 / 4 = 16

2. **Determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes:**
   - Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars.
   - Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = Total chocolate bars / Number of boxes
   - Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = 56 / 7 = 8

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha:**
   - Difference = Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes - Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes
   - Difference = 16 - 8 = 8

"First, we need to find out how many female porcupines there are. Since the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we calculate:

3/5 * 50 = 30 female porcupines

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the number of babies born each month is:

30 * 4 = 120 babies per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

120 * 12 = 1440 babies

Adding these babies to the original population of 50 porcupines, the total population after a year will be:

50 + 1440 = 1490

"To find out how much it will cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Use the volume to find out how many gallons of water are needed.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular shape, so we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons.
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18,000 = 4,500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4,500 = 3,375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total first day} = 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 \text{ gallons}

"To find out how much charge the power bank had when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 0.07 \times 3x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - So, \( 0.79x = 28 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{28}{0.79} \approx 35.44\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 0.09 \times 5y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is 35.44%.
   - So, \( 0.55y = 35.44 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{35.44}{0.55} \approx 64.44\%

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is similar to calculating the growth of the price over time. The formula is:

\[ \text{Future Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here, the initial price of carrots is $120, the rate of increase is 5% (or 0.05 as a decimal), and the number of years is 3.

First, we calculate the factor by which the price increases each year:
\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise this factor to the power of 3 (for three years):
\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply the initial price by this factor to find the future price:
\[ 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding 138.915 to the nearest integer gives us:
\[ 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139.

"First, we need to find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

72 pictures ÷ 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies and 2 albums were portraits. So, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits:

Selfies: 3 albums × 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies
Portraits: 2 albums × 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits

Adding these together gives us the total number of selfies and portraits:

27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45 pictures

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the price of a large stuffed animal:**
   - Each small stuffed animal costs $4.
   - A large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one.
   - Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of small and large stuffed animals sold:**
   - Let \( L \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - The total earnings from selling small stuffed animals is \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars.
   - The total earnings from selling large stuffed animals is \( 12 \times L = 12L \) dollars.
   - The total earnings from all sales is \( 8L + 12L = 20L \) dollars.

4. **Set up the equation based on the total earnings:**
   - Teresa earned $120 in total.
   - Therefore, \( 20L = 120 \).

5. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - \( L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \).

6. **Determine the number of small stuffed animals sold:**
   - Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), and \( L = 6 \), the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches each person eats in a day and then multiply by 7 days.

1. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
2. The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
3. The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

First, we add the number of sandwiches each person eats per day:
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day for the family.

Next, we multiply the daily total by 7 to find the weekly total:
11 sandwiches/day × 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.

"First, let's find out how much money Suzanne made from selling cookies and cupcakes.

Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so she made:
80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80

She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so she made:
60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240

Now, let's add the money from the cookies and cupcakes to find her total earnings:
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away:
2 sisters * $10/sister = $20

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings:
$320 - $20 = $300

"First, let's figure out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe.

1. A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so:
   12 pounds * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so:
   24 pounds * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, let's calculate how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in one day with steel pickaxes:
40 dwarves * 36 pounds per dwarf = 1440 pounds per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days:

"To find out how much the package with 8 sandwiches will cost, we need to understand the price per sandwich in the other packages and then apply that to the 8-sandwich package.

1. For the first package, there are 2 sandwiches for $3. So, the price per sandwich is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package, there are 4 sandwiches for $6. So, the price per sandwich is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package should also be $1.5. Therefore, for 8 sandwiches, the cost will be:
   \[
   8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   - Yellow: 12

2. **Burst Red Balloons:**
   - 40% of the red balloons burst.
   - 40% of 25 = 0.40 * 25 = 10
   - Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15

3. **Released Yellow Balloons:**
   - Sally released half of the yellow balloons.

"To find out the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider all the scenarios where he won't have to turn it in and then subtract that from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - There's a 50% chance that there will be a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. This means there's a 50% chance he won't have to turn it in because of the substitute.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - If the normal teacher is there (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. This means there's a 50% * 40% = 20% chance he won't have to turn it in because of a class extension.
   - If the normal teacher is there and doesn't give an extension (50% * 60% = 30% chance), there's still a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment. This means there's a 30% * 20% = 6% chance he won't have to turn it in because of a personal extension.

Now, let's add up all the chances he won't have to turn in his homework:
- 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (class extension) + 6% (personal extension) = 76%

So, the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
100% - 76% = 24%

"To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - So, he can eat \( 75 \times 2 = 150 \) medium-sized beans.

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - Therefore, to find out how many small beans he can eat, we multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3.
   - So, he can eat \( 150 \times 3 = 450 \) small beans.

"First, let's figure out how much Melissa earns in total from her jury duty. She is paid $15 per day and she works for 3 days.

Total earnings = $15/day * 3 days = $45

Next, we need to calculate her total expenses. She has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days.

Total expenses = $3/day * 3 days = $9

Now, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find out how much she makes after expenses.

Earnings after expenses = Total earnings - Total expenses = $45 - $9 = $36

Finally, we need to find out how much she makes per hour. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so the total hours spent is:

Total hours = 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours

Now, we divide her earnings after expenses by the total hours to find her hourly rate.

Hourly rate = Earnings after expenses / Total hours = $36 / 18 hours = $2

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many soda bottles Richard will place and how long it will take him to go from one bottle to the next.

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles.

2. **Calculate the time to go from one bottle to the next:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he only needs to move between the bottles, not to the first one.
   - Number of moves = Number of bottles - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 moves.
   - Total time = 7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds.

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds.

"First, let's figure out how much money Jim borrowed for college. He borrowed $50,000 each year for 4 years.

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money Jim lost by not working during the 4 years he was in college. He would have earned $25,000 each year if he had continued working.

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

So, the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to cover his loans and the lost income is:

\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

Now, let's find out how much Jim earns after college. His degree tripled his income, so:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

To find out how long it will take Jim to earn $300,000 at his new salary of $75,000 per year, we divide the total amount by his annual salary:

\[ 300,000 \div 75,000 = 4 \]

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he needs. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of the fabric piece will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of the fabric piece will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) × 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount he lost in the first race is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - So, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - He won $11 in the second race, so he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost and the average loss:

- Total amount lost:
  - First race: $5
  - Third race: $16.5
  - Total loss = \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\) dollars

- Total number of races: 3

- Average loss per race:

1. Let the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set be \( x \).
2. In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

According to the problem, the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. So, we can write the equation:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve this equation, we first combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Now, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

So, the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is 10.

"To find out how much it will cost to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of tiles needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and the cost per tile.

**Step 1: Determine the number of tiles needed.**

Since each tile is 1 square foot (because each side is 1 foot), and your kitchen floor is 200 square feet, you will need 200 tiles.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each tile costs $12, so for 200 tiles, the total cost will be:
200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400

So, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400.

"First, we need to find out how much more James has to pay each month because of the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%.

To find 60% of $120:
60% of 120 = 0.60 * 120 = 72

So, the cost after the accident is:
120 + 72 = 192

Now, to find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
192 * 12 = 2304

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of loads per week:**
   - Greg needs to wash 4 twin sets of sheets. Since his machine can only wash 2 twin sets at a time, he will need to do 2 loads for the twin sheets (4 twin sets / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads).
   - He also needs to wash 1 king set of sheets, which requires 1 load.

   So, each week, Greg does 2 loads for the twin sheets and 1 load for the king sheet, making a total of 3 loads per week.

2. **Calculate the number of loads per year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - If Greg does 3 loads per week, then in a year, he will do 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads.

So, the total number of loads Greg does in a year is:

156"
"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of movies they watch on Saturday.
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. Determine the number of movies they watch on Sunday.
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Half of 4 is 2, so they watch 2 movies on Sunday.

3. Calculate the total number of movies they watch in one weekend.
   - On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
   - On Sunday, they watch 2 movies.
   - Total for one weekend: 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

4. Calculate the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks.
   - They watch 6 movies each weekend.
   - Over 4 weeks, they watch: 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection now, we need to add up the stickers he had and collected over the past years.

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, he collected 50 more stickers, so he had:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150 \text{ stickers}
   \]
3. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers he collected last year. Last year he collected 50 stickers, so this year he collected:
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ stickers}
   \]
4. Adding this year's stickers to his collection from last year:
   \[
   150 + 100 = 250 \text{ stickers}
   \]

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection now.

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of food the cats eat in one day.
2. Divide the total amount of food Imma has by the amount the cats eat in one day.

First, Imma feeds her cats 60 grams of food twice a day, so:
60 grams x 2 = 120 grams per day for one cat.

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food they eat in one day is:
120 grams x 3 = 360 grams per day for all three cats.

Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of food by the amount the cats eat in one day:
720 grams ÷ 360 grams/day = 2 days.

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - So, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - So, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31.

"To find out how long Betsy's part took, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's call the time Donovan took to make his part of the meal \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which took 18 minutes longer, is:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To find out the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the different costs:

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The doctor charges $300 per hour for a visit. Since the visit lasted 30 minutes, which is half an hour, the cost is $300/2 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4 per pill. For 30 pills, the cost is 30 * $4 = $120.
4. The parking fee is $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the cost is 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, we add all these costs together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to find out how many emails James responds to each day. Since 20% of the emails don't require a response, that means 80% do require a response.

To find 80% of 80 emails:
80 emails * 80% = 80 emails * 0.8 = 64 emails

So, James responds to 64 emails each day. Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

"To find out how many classes visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many as Monday visited, which is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) classes.
- On Wednesday, three times as many as Monday visited, which is \(32 \times 3 = 96\) classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

\[32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\]

First, add 32 and 64:

\[32 + 64 = 96\]

Then, add 96 (result from the first addition) and 96 (from Wednesday):

\[96 + 96 = 192\]

Next, add 192 and 30:

\[192 + 30 = 222\]

Finally, add 222 and 25:

\[222 + 25 = 247\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247.

"First, let's figure out how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
70% of 20 = 0.70 * 20 = 14 pizzas

So, the glee club has:
20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left

Next, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club:
2 * 20 = 40 pizzas

The football team ate 80% of them:
80% of 40 = 0.80 * 40 = 32 pizzas

So, the football team has:
40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left

Now, let's add the pizzas left from both groups:

"To find out how much Anthony spends on postage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of big coupons Anthony is sending out.
2. Calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons.
3. Calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons.
4. Add the costs together to get the total amount spent on postage.

Step 1: Number of big coupons
Anthony is sending out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ big coupons} \]

Step 2: Cost of mailing the small coupons
Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. So, for 700 small coupons:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Step 3: Cost of mailing the big coupons
Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. So, for 1400 big coupons:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Step 4: Total cost of postage
To find the total cost, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of trucks dispatched**: 20 trucks.
2. **Number of trucks with mechanical failures**: A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures. 
   - A quarter of 20 trucks is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) trucks.
3. **Number of trucks that successfully delivered**: 
   - Total trucks dispatched minus trucks with mechanical failures: \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) trucks.
4. **Fertiliser per truck**: Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.
5. **Total fertiliser delivered**: 
   - Number of trucks that successfully delivered multiplied by the fertiliser per truck: \( 15 \times 20 = 300 \) tons.

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

"To find out how much Dennis will spend on butter, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total amount of butter needed:**
   - Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
   - He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   - So, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   - The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off.""
   - This means for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays full price for 1 pound and half price for the other pound.

3. **Calculate the cost for 2 pounds of butter:**
   - Full price for 1 pound: $4.00
   - Half price for 1 pound: $4.00 / 2 = $2.00
   - Total cost for 2 pounds: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

4. **Calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - Since 6 pounds is 3 sets of 2 pounds, we multiply the cost for 2 pounds by 3.
   - Total cost for 6 pounds: $6.00 * 3 = $18.00

So, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is $18.00.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, let's break down the information given:

1. Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week (7 days).
2. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
3. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.
4. The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys each day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.
5. The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys each day is 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day.
6. The number of bananas the third monkey eats each day is the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys each day minus the number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys each day: 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"First, let's figure out how much Jenny spends on the roses. Since she bought 15 roses, we can calculate the cost in two ways:
1. She could buy 1 dozen and 3 individual roses.
2. She could buy all 15 as individual roses.

Let's use the first method because it's cheaper:
- 1 dozen roses cost $15.
- 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6.

So, the total cost for 15 roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which means she had 5 * $5 = $25.

Now, let's find out how much change she gets:
- Change = $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $4 into quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so:
- Number of quarters = $4 / $0.25 = 16.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"First, let's find out how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She saves 10 toothpicks each week and has been saving for 12 weeks. So, we multiply 10 by 12:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach 200. We subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number needed:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week to find out how many more weeks she needs to save:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, Melanie needs 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation for one spring:**
   - One spring creates 1 jellyfish every second.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to compare the cost of buying the bananas in bunches to the cost of buying them individually.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Finally, let's find out how much money Jenny saved:

John goes to class 5 days a week, so the total time spent in class each week is:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

John also spends extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time each day on these days. So, the extra time spent each day is:
\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he does this on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra time spent over the weekend is:
\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent in class during the week to the extra time spent over the weekend to get the total weekly learning time:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"First, we need to find out how high Nathan drops the ball from. Since each story is 24 feet high and he drops it from the third floor, the starting height is:

24 feet/story * 3 stories = 72 feet

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. So, on the first bounce, it reaches:

72 feet * 2/3 = 48 feet

On the second bounce, it will again reach 2/3rds of the height it reached on the first bounce:

48 feet * 2/3 = 32 feet

"To find out how tall the fourth child is, we need to follow the information given step by step and convert all heights to inches.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the first child is:
   \[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
   \[ 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches} \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[ 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches} \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:
   \[ 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

So, the fourth child is 72 inches tall.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat.
2. Before the Allosaurus ate, the velociraptors had already taken half of what was left after the T-Rex. This means the 270 kilograms was the remaining half after the velociraptors ate.
3. So, before the velociraptors ate, there must have been 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat.
4. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms was the remaining half after the T-Rex ate.
5. Therefore, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

"To find out how much it will cost to paint the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then figure out how many gallons of paint are needed and the total cost.

1. Calculate the area of the north and south walls:
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, total area = 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

2. Calculate the area of the east and west walls:
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, total area = 40 square feet * 2 = 80 square feet.

3. Add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
   - Total area = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

4. Determine how many gallons of paint are needed:
   - One gallon covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

5. Calculate the total cost:
   - Each gallon costs $12.
   - Total cost = 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.

The total cost to paint the room is $144.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 of them.

2. **After Ellen's Actions:**
   - Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - Now, there are 11 sodas left: 3 shaken and 8 unshaken.

3. **After Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - Now, there are 8 sodas left: 2 shaken and 6 unshaken.

4. **Ellen's Friend's Situation:**
   - Ellen's friend now has 8 sodas to choose from: 2 shaken and 6 unshaken.

5. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.
   - Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of sodas left
   - Probability = 2 / 8 = 1 / 4

6. **Converting to Percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, multiply by 100.
   - Percentage = (1 / 4) * 100 = 25%

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

"First, let's figure out the total number of days Billy can help people. 

From March 1st to April 19th, we have:
- All 31 days in March
- 19 days in April (up to April 19th)

So, the total number of days is:
31 + 19 = 50 days

Billy takes 20% of these days off. So, the number of days he takes off is:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

This means he works:
50 - 10 = 40 days

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours each day. So, the number of people he helps each day is:
2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Over 40 days, the total number of people he helps is:
6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the cars and buses could carry.

First, let's calculate the number of people the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.
So, the total number of people the buses could carry is \(12 \times 35 = 420\).

Next, let's calculate the number of people the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.
So, the total number of people the cars could carry is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

Now, we add the number of people the buses and cars could carry to find the total number of people:
- Total people = 420 (from buses) + 60 (from cars) = 480.

Therefore, the total number of people who were inside the church is 480.

"First, let's figure out what Sheila's credit card balance was after she returned the $15.00 item. She originally charged $85.00, so:

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount. The original price is $20.00, so the discount is:

20% of $20.00 = 0.20 × $20.00 = $4.00

The price of the frying pan after the discount is:

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount. The original price is $30.00, so the discount is:

10% of $30.00 = 0.10 × $30.00 = $3.00

The price of the towels after the discount is:

$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to Sheila's current balance:

$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

So, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is:

$113.00"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( x \).

2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).

3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).

4. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{15} = 6
   \]

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 6 \times 15
   \]
   \[
   x = 90

"To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to figure out the total number of students in the school. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys.

1. First, we find the total number of students in the school. If 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.40 \times \text{Total Students} = 240
   \]
2. To find the total number of students, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
   \[
   \text{Total Students} = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600
   \]
3. Now that we know there are 600 students in total, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
   \[
   \text{Number of Girls} = \text{Total Students} - \text{Number of Boys} = 600 - 240 = 360

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total miles Soledad wants to hike in June:** 9,300 miles.
2. **Number of days in June:** 30 days.
3. **Miles Soledad plans to hike each day:** 125 miles twice a day, which is 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

Now, let's calculate how many miles she will hike in total if she sticks to her plan:
- **Total miles hiked in 30 days:** 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles.

Soledad needs to hike 9,300 miles, but with her current plan, she will only hike 7,500 miles. Let's find out how many more miles she needs to hike:
- **Additional miles needed:** 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we divide the additional miles by the number of days:
- **Additional miles per day:** 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day.

So, Soledad needs to hike an additional 60 miles each day to complete her journey on time.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
60 pounds / 4 = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
60 pounds / 2 = 30 pounds

Now, let's add the weights of all the dogs together:
Kory’s dog: 60 pounds
Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds
Elijah's second dog: 30 pounds

60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob and kept 9 for himself.**
   - This means Kris had \(7 + 9 = 16\) stickers.

2. **Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris after using half of the stickers he received from Seth.**
   - Since Kris received 16 stickers, this means Luis gave 16 stickers to Kris.
   - Since Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth, the 16 stickers he gave to Kris must be the other half.
   - Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.

3. **Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.**
   - Since Luis received 32 stickers from Seth, this means Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"First, we need to find out how many M&M's John has in total from the 3 large bags. Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 30 M&M's in each ounce.

So, the total number of M&M's in one large bag is:
10 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 300 M&M's

Since John has 3 large bags, the total number of M&M's is:
300 M&M's/bag * 3 bags = 900 M&M's

Now, if John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, the number of small bags he can make is:
900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 small bags

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance that is half of the way around the earth.
2. Calculate how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance.

First, the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of the way around the earth is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how fast the 2nd fastest car goes. We know that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
2. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
3. So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is 5 times 120 miles per hour.
4. Next, we need to find out how fast the fastest car goes. We know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
5. We multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25 to get the speed of the fastest car.

Let's do the math:

1. Speed of the 2nd fastest car: \( 5 \times 120 = 600 \) miles per hour.
2. Speed of the fastest car: \( 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \) miles per hour.

So, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Liam is currently 16 years old.
2. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
3. At that time, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince. So, if we let Vince's age two years ago be \( V \), then:
   \[
   14 = 2V
   \]
4. Solving for \( V \):
   \[
   V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
5. This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago.
6. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
   \[
   7 + 2 = 9
   \]

So, Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total eggs painted by all four**: 56 eggs.
2. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah together**: 30 eggs.
3. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline together**: 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.
4. **Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs**: So, each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now, let's figure out how many eggs Camden and Sarah each painted:
5. **Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah**. Let's say Sarah painted \( S \) eggs. Then Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
6. **Total eggs painted by Camden and Sarah**: \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \).
7. Simplify the equation: \( 2S + 12 = 30 \).
8. Subtract 12 from both sides: \( 2S = 18 \).
9. Divide by 2: \( S = 9 \).

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
10. **Camden painted 21 eggs**.
11. **Arnold painted 13 eggs**.
12. **Difference**: 21 - 13 = 8.

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"First, we need to find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons. We do this by dividing 200 by 8:
200 ÷ 8 = 25 groups

Each group goes into one box, so there are 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so:
25 boxes × 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Now, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so:
200 crayons × 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces

We add the weight of the boxes and the crayons to get the total weight in ounces:
200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so:
400 ounces ÷ 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from the 64 feet of usable tree:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each of these logs, he cuts 5 planks:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so the total amount he makes is:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"First, let's find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings by multiplying Valerie's earnings by 2:

Brother's earnings = $5000 * 2 = $10000

Next, we need to find out the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:

Combined salary = Valerie's earnings + Brother's earnings
Combined salary = $5000 + $10000 = $15000

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so we calculate her earnings as follows:

Mother's earnings = 2 * Combined salary
Mother's earnings = 2 * $15000 = $30000

Now, to find the total amount of money they all have together, we add up the earnings of Valerie, her brother, and their mother:

Total amount = Valerie's earnings + Brother's earnings + Mother's earnings
Total amount = $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Grandma's speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

2. **Determine Grandma's speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * 0.05 miles per minute = 0.1 miles per minute.

3. **Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk:**
   - Distance on the sidewalk = 1 mile.
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes.

"First, let's find out how much Jane has already saved. She saves $4 every week, and she has been saving for 8 weeks. So, we multiply $4 by 8 weeks:

$4 * 8 = $32

Jane has saved $32 so far. She wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract what she has already saved from her goal:

$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save the additional $28. Since she saves $4 each week, we divide the amount she still needs to save by the amount she saves each week:

$28 ÷ $4 = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"First, let's figure out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if Bob gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let's set up the equation:
\[ \text{Initial marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:
\[ \text{Initial marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Initial marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from his initial number of marbles:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that would make the mixed water in Donny's water bottle at least 40 degrees.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Temperatures:**
   - Mug 1: 33 degrees
   - Mug 2: Unknown temperature (let's call it \( T \) degrees)

2. **Amounts of Water Mixed:**
   - 4 ounces from Mug 1
   - 1 ounce from Mug 2

3. **Total Volume of Mixed Water:**
   - 4 ounces + 1 ounce = 5 ounces

4. **Temperature Calculation:**
   - The temperature of the mixed water is the weighted average of the temperatures of the water from both mugs.
   - The formula for the temperature of the mixed water is:
     \[
     \text{Mixed Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
     \]

5. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - We know that the mixed temperature must be at least 40 degrees:
     \[
     \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
     \]

6. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):
     \[
     4 \times 33 = 132
     \]
   - Substitute this into the equation:
     \[
     \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     132 + T \geq 200
     \]
   - Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):
     \[
     T \geq 68
     \]

So, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

"First, let's find out the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so:
4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00

Now, let's calculate the discount. A 10% discount on $40.00 is:
10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

So, the total cost after the discount is:
$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Russell gets 4 packs of bagels, and each pack has 9 bagels, so the total number of bagels is:
4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel

So, the cost of each single bagel is:

"First, let's figure out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem says Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we do:
23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are used to make the scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem says it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we do:
6 - 3 = 3 potatoes
3 - 1 = 2 scoops

This means 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a proportion:
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops

To solve for x, we cross-multiply and divide:
(3 potatoes * 18 scoops) / 2 scoops = x potatoes
54 / 2 = 27 potatoes

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats.

1. For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
   \(3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}\)

2. For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
   \(5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}\)

3. Now, we add the eggs from both periods to get the total number of eggs:
   \(90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}\)

4. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs:
   \(240 \text{ eggs} \div 12 = 20 \text{ dozens}\)

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to calculate the number of sunflowers sold individually and the number of sunflowers sold as part of the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold individually:
- Faraday earns $26 from selling sunflowers at $2 each per day.
- The number of sunflowers sold per day is $26 ÷ $2 = 13 sunflowers.

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each per day.
- The number of bouquets sold per day is $56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets.

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold in bouquets per day is:
- 7 bouquets × 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand:**
   - Since 1 bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, to cover 100%, we need:
     \[
     \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \text{ bottles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - If 1 person needs 5 bottles, then 2300 people will need:
     \[
     2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed:
     \[
     11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
     \]

So, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's figure out how much land Abraham sold each time and how much he earned from each sale.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left.
4. He then sold 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. 1/4 of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. After selling another 10 square meters, he has 30 square meters left.
6. He then sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 30 * $3 = $90 from the last sale.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned from the sales:
- First sale: $50
- Second sale: $30
- Third sale: $90

Total earnings = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections he makes in a week.
4. Calculate his total earnings based on the number of collections and the rate he gets paid.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.**
- The first two complexes have 200 apartments each.
- Combined, the first two complexes have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.
- The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two.
- 60% of 400 is \(0.60 \times 400 = 240\).
- Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

**Step 2: Find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.**
- The total number of apartments is \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\).

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections he makes in a week.**
- John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment.
- Therefore, the total number of collections in a week is \(1040 \times 3 = 3120\).

**Step 4: Calculate his total earnings based on the number of collections and the rate he gets paid.**
- John gets paid $0.40 per collection.
- Therefore, his total earnings in a week are \(3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\).

So, John makes $1248 in a week.

1. **5-year-old tree:** Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree:** Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - Initial amount (5-year-old) = 50 fruits
   - 6-year-old = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree:** Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - 7-year-old = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree:** Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
5. **9-year-old tree:** Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree:** Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - 10-year-old = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits
   - 8-year-old = 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Now, let's add up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:

- 5-year-old: 50 fruits

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   B + 4B + B + 7 = 37
   \]
   \[
   6B + 7 = 37
   \]
6. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   6B = 30
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   B = 5
   \]
8. The length of the red rope is \( 4B \):

"Let's use some simple math to figure this out.

First, let's say Colin's current age is \( C \) and Wendy's current age is \( W \).

From the first part of the problem, we know:
\[ W = 5 \times (C + 7) \]
This means Wendy's age is five times what Colin's age will be in seven years.

From the second part of the problem, we know:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times W \]
This means in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( C \).

First, solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Now, substitute \( W \) in the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times (5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the net number of snowballs Jay makes in one hour:**
   - Jay makes 20 snowballs in one hour.
   - In one hour, there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes each.
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so in one hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt.
   - Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay makes in one hour is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs.

2. **Calculate how long it will take to make 60 snowballs:**
   - If Jay makes 12 snowballs in one hour, we need to find out how many hours it will take to make 60 snowballs.
   - We can set up the equation: 12 snowballs/hour * number of hours = 60 snowballs.
   - Solving for the number of hours: number of hours = 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to make 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, so it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now.
   - In 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Let's say they started with \( x \) bandages on the first day.

   After using 38 bandages and adding 50 bandages, the number of bandages at the end of the first day is:
   \[
   x - 38 + 50 = x + 12
   \]

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - The number of bandages at the end of the second day is:
   \[
   (x + 12) - 28 = x + 12 - 28 = x - 16
   \]

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) bandages.
   - The number of bandages at the end of the third day is:
   \[
   (x - 16) + 100 - 25 = x - 16 + 75 = x + 59
   \]

4. **Final Condition:**
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.
   - So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 59 = 78
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x + 59 = 78
   \]
   \[
   x = 78 - 59
   \]
   \[
   x = 19
   \]

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To find out how much May's haircut and color cost, we need to calculate the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut separately, and then add them together.

1. The cost of the color is a flat rate of $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the length of hair cut off is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

Now, we calculate the cost of the haircut:
- Cost of haircut = 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60

Next, we add the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut:
- Total cost = Cost of color + Cost of haircut = $40 + $60 = $100

So, the total cost for May's cut and color is:

"To find out how much Jen will receive in April, we need to calculate her earnings from her hourly work and her additional attendance bonus.

1. **Calculate the weekly earnings from hourly work:**
   - Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week.
   - Total hours worked in a week = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
   - Her hourly rate is $1.5.
   - Weekly earnings from hourly work = 45 hours/week * $1.5/hour = $67.5/week

2. **Calculate the monthly earnings from hourly work:**
   - There are 4 weeks in April.
   - Monthly earnings from hourly work = $67.5/week * 4 weeks = $270

3. **Calculate the attendance bonus:**
   - Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week.
   - Monthly attendance bonus = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

4. **Calculate the total monthly earnings:**

"To find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up all the groups of people that came in at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. This means 2 * 40 = 80 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (in the morning) entered the restaurant. This means 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after a while) + 150 (evening) = 320

"First, let's find out how much each bottle of scotch costs:
- John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600.
- So, each bottle of scotch costs $600 / 10 = $60.

Next, let's figure out how many bottles of cognac John buys:
- He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.
- So, he buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

Now, let's find out how much each bottle of cognac costs:
- Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch.
- 50% of $60 is $60 * 0.50 = $30.
- So, each bottle of cognac costs $60 + $30 = $90.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the cognac:
- 20 bottles of cognac at $90 each is 20 * $90 = $1800.

Finally, let's add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

"First, let's figure out how many trees Mr. Julius planted on the first day.

He planted 20 White Oak trees.

He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so:
20 White Oak trees * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so:
20 White Oak trees + 10 White Oak trees = 30 White Oak trees

For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than the first day. First, we need to find out what 1/4 of the first day's Lodgepole Pine trees is:
40 Lodgepole Pine trees / 4 = 10 Lodgepole Pine trees

So, on the second day, he planted:
40 Lodgepole Pine trees + 10 Lodgepole Pine trees = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's add up all the trees he planted over the two days.

White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees
Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees

"To find out how many coffee mugs are in the teacher’s lounge, we can set up an equation based on the information given. 

Let's say the number of coffee mugs is \( x \).

The problem says ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40."" This can be written as:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \).

First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

   - Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each.
   - So, the total number of colors from the palettes is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
   - Amy also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each.
   - So, the total number of colors from the makeup sets is \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

2. **Total Initial Colors:**
   - Adding the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets, Amy initially had \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

3. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette with 4 colors is stolen.
   - So, the number of colors left from the palettes is \(8 - 4 = 4\) colors.

4. **Using Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors.
   - Half of these colors are used up, so \(6 \div 2 = 3\) colors are used.
   - The number of colors left in that makeup set is \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors.
   - The other two makeup sets still have all their colors, so \(2 \times 6 = 12\) colors remain.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   - The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base.
   - Volume = base area × height
   - Base area = 6 inches × 6 inches = 36 square inches
   - Height = 15 inches
   - Volume = 36 square inches × 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   - The packing efficiency is 80%, so only 80% of the jar's volume is occupied by jelly beans.
   - Effective volume = 540 cubic inches × 0.80 = 432 cubic inches

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans in the jar:**
   - Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   - Number of jelly beans = effective volume / volume per jelly bean
   - Number of jelly beans = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   - Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   - Number of red jelly beans = 2880 jelly beans × 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   - The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   - Difference = true number - Tim's estimate
   - Difference = 900 - 864 = 36

So, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

Next, we need to find the new cost of a visit after the 150% increase. A 150% increase means the cost is 250% of the original cost. So, the new cost per visit is:
$2 * 250% = $2 * 2.5 = $5

Now, we calculate the cost for the next 3 years with the new visit cost:
3 visits/year * $5/visit = $15/year

For 3 years, the total cost is:
3 years * $15/year = $45

Finally, we add the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years to find the total amount Pauline spent:
$30 + $45 = $75

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many groups of 8 students there are and then calculate the total time needed for all groups to complete the escape room.

1. First, we need to find out the total number of students who get to try the escape room. There are 10 students from each grade, and there are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th).

   Total students = 10 students/grade * 4 grades = 40 students

2. Next, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students.

   Number of groups = Total students / Students per group = 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups

3. Each group gets 45 minutes to try the escape room. So, we need to calculate the total time for all 5 groups.

   Total time = Number of groups * Time per group = 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes

So, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames.

First, we calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John made 4 wooden tables.
- Each table costs $20.
- So, the total cost for the tables is 4 tables * $20/table = $80.

Next, we calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John made 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- So, the total cost for the roof frames is 2 frames * $10/frame = $20.

Now, we add the total costs of the tables and the frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total cost = Cost of tables + Cost of frames = $80 + $20 = $100.

So, Ali has to pay John $100.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's call the length of the shorter piece \( x \) feet.
2. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.
3. The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is \( x + 4x \).
4. We know the total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 4x = 40
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   5x = 40
   \]
6. Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
   \[
   x = 8
   \]
7. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x \), so:
   \[
   4 \times 8 = 32
   \]

The longer piece is 32 feet long.

"To find out how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs.

Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the number of pounds needed for 80 meatballs by dividing 80 by 16.

\[ \text{Pounds of meat needed} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. So, for 5 pounds of ground beef, he will need:

\[ \text{Total seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

"To find out how much fabric Luke should buy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total width of all the windows.
2. Multiply the total width by 2 to get the amount of fabric needed.

First, let's find the total width of all the windows:
- Each window is 35 inches wide.
- There are 5 windows.

So, the total width is:
\[ 35 \text{ inches/window} \times 5 \text{ windows} = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to multiply the total width by 2 to find out how much fabric Luke should buy:
\[ 175 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.

"To solve this, we need to break the call into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes after that.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute.
   16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. The call lasts for 36 minutes in total, so the remaining minutes are:
   36 minutes - 16 minutes = 20 minutes

3. For these remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute.
   20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

4. Now, add the costs of both parts of the call:
   $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The total cost of a 36-minute call is $8.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of treats needed:**
   - Carly's class has 5 people.
   - Each person gets 2 treats.
   - Total treats needed = 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes.
   - Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   - Number of brownies = \( 3c - 2 \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total number of treats:**
   - Total treats = Number of cupcakes + Number of brownies
   - Total treats = \( c + (3c - 2) \)
   - Total treats = \( 4c - 2 \)

4. **Solve for \( c \):**
   - We know the total treats needed is 10.
   - \( 4c - 2 = 10 \)
   - Add 2 to both sides: \( 4c = 12 \)
   - Divide both sides by 4: \( c = 3 \)

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"First, let's find out the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The cost of a basic manicure is $35.
The cost of a basic pedicure is $40.

The total cost without the discount is:
$35 + $40 = $75

The discount is 20%, so the discount amount is:
20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15

The total cost after the discount is:
$75 - $15 = $60

Now, let's add the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers. She has 10 fingers.

The cost of nail art per nail is $3, so for 10 nails:

"First, let's find out the price of the toy in December after it increased by 80%.

The original price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price went up by 80% of $40.

80% of $40 is calculated as:
\[ 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December was:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. A 50% decrease means the price went down by half of $72.

50% of $72 is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January after the discount was:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

"To find out how much Charlie makes in a day, we need to calculate the earnings from both types of lessons.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons:
- Charlie charges $80 per hour for standard lessons.
- He has 4 standard lessons today.
- So, the total from standard lessons is \( 4 \times 80 = 320 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the veteran lessons:
- Charlie reduces his rate by 25% for veterans.
- 25% of $80 is \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \) dollars.
- So, the reduced rate for veterans is \( 80 - 20 = 60 \) dollars per hour.
- He has 2 veteran lessons today.
- So, the total from veteran lessons is \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) dollars.

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total for the day:
- Total earnings = Earnings from standard lessons + Earnings from veteran lessons
- Total earnings = \( 320 + 120 = 440 \) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

"First, let's find out how many apples Walter ate. He ate 2/5 of the 60 apples:
\[ \text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many apples were left after he ate 24 of them:
\[ \text{Remaining apples} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples:
\[ \text{Apples given to sister} = \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 9 \]

Now, we find out how many apples Walter had left after giving 9 to his sister:
\[ \text{Remaining apples after giving to sister} = 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each:
\[ \text{Money received} = 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Use the formula for percentage to find out what part of the total distance (6000 km) he has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days:
- Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr.
- There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, there are \(3 \times 24 = 72\) hours.
- The total distance he travels is \(50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 72 \, \text{hr} = 3600 \, \text{km}\).

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that 3600 km represents:
- The formula for percentage is \(\left( \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \right) \times 100\).
- Here, the part is 3600 km and the whole is 6000 km.
- So, the percentage is \(\left( \frac{3600}{6000} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\%\).

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish.
2. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish.
3. Find the difference between the two total drying times.

First, let's calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish:
- Each painting takes 7 minutes to dry.
- For 6 paintings: \( 7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish:
- Each painting takes 12 minutes to dry.
- For 6 paintings: \( 12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, let's find the difference between the two total drying times:
- Difference: \( 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break it down step by step:

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - 4 plants need 0.5 cups each.
   - Total water for these plants: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups.

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - 8 plants need 1 cup each.
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups.

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Crista has 20 plants in total.
   - 4 plants need half a cup and 8 plants need 1 cup, so \(4 + 8 = 12\) plants are accounted for.
   - The rest of the plants: \(20 - 12 = 8\) plants.
   - These 8 plants need 0.25 cups each.
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups.

4. **Total water needed:**
   - Add the water needed for all the plants: \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups.

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it takes Phineas Frog to travel 200 yards back to his home, with half the distance on land and the other half in water.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: Half of 200 yards = 100 yards
3. **Distance in Water**: Half of 200 yards = 100 yards

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each part of the journey:

4. **Time on Land**: 
   - Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
   - Distance on land = 100 yards
   - Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

5. **Time in Water**:
   - Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
   - Distance in water = 100 yards
   - Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

6. **Total Time**:
   - Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

So, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the following 30 seconds, four times the initial rate pop, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so it's 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped:
20 (first 30 seconds) + 60 (second 30 seconds) + 80 (third 30 seconds) + 40 (fourth 30 seconds) + 10 (after heat) = 210

"To find out how much time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on meditation each day:
- She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening.
- So, each day she meditates for \(15 + 15 = 30\) minutes.

Next, let's find out how much time she spends on meditation in one week:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, in one week, she meditates for \(30 \times 7 = 210\) minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time she spends on meditation in 4 weeks:
- In 4 weeks, she meditates for \(210 \times 4 = 840\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time she spends on yoga each week:
- She practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week.
- So, in one week, she practices yoga for \(1 \times 5 = 5\) hours.

Now, let's convert the yoga time into minutes:
- 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 5 hours is \(5 \times 60 = 300\) minutes.

Next, let's find out how much time she spends on yoga in 4 weeks:
- In 4 weeks, she practices yoga for \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) minutes.

Finally, let's add the time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks:
- Total time spent on meditation and yoga is \(840 + 1200 = 2040\) minutes.

"To find out how many square feet the quilt is, we need to calculate the total area of fabric from all the t-shirts Octavia uses. We do this by multiplying the number of each type of t-shirt by its area and then adding all the areas together.

1. Calculate the area for the small t-shirts:
   - Each small t-shirt is 3 square feet.
   - Octavia uses 11 small t-shirts.
   - Total area for small t-shirts = 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.

2. Calculate the area for the medium t-shirts:
   - Each medium t-shirt is 4 square feet.
   - Octavia uses 8 medium t-shirts.
   - Total area for medium t-shirts = 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.

3. Calculate the area for the large t-shirts:
   - Each large t-shirt is 6 square feet.
   - Octavia uses 6 large t-shirts.
   - Total area for large t-shirts = 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

4. Add the areas of all the t-shirts to get the total area of the quilt:
   - Total area = 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

So, the quilt is 101 square feet.

"First, let's figure out the cost of the T-shirts with the deal. The deal is buy one get one 50% off. So, if Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the first one is $8, and the second one is 50% off, which means it's $8 * 50% = $4.

The total cost for the T-shirts is:
$8 (first T-shirt) + $4 (second T-shirt) = $12

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The shoes are 40% off the original price of $40. So, the discount on the shoes is:
$40 * 40% = $16

The price Jake pays for the shoes is:
$40 (original price) - $16 (discount) = $24

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
$12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:

"First, let's figure out how many holes Nate's dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes Nate fills each day is:
9 holes/day - 6 holes/night = 3 holes/day

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to convert the number of days into weeks:

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple system of equations. Let's define:
- \( C \) as the number of chickens.
- \( K \) as the number of cows.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write:
\[ C + K = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so:
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

Now, we can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( K \):
\[ K = 20 - C \]

Next, substitute \( K \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( C \):
\[ 2C + 80 - 4C = 70 \]
\[ -2C + 80 = 70 \]
\[ -2C = 70 - 80 \]
\[ -2C = -10 \]
\[ C = 5 \]
