"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to consider both the blue and white fibers.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as many bolts of white fiber as blue fiber. Since it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it will take \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Adding the bolts of blue and white fiber together:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

Therefore, the total number of bolts needed is 3.

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the house:**
   - Purchase price: $80,000
   - Repair costs: $50,000
   - Total cost: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Determine the increased value of the house:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.
   - 150% of the original purchase price ($80,000) is calculated as:
     \[
     150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
     \]
   - Therefore, the new value of the house is:
     \[
     80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Selling price: $200,000
   - Total cost: $130,000
   - Profit: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Thus, Josh's profit is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance John initially travels:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Determine the distance John covers on his return trip:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since the total return trip is 4 hours and he has already spent 2.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Calculate the total distance John covers on his return trip:**
   - Total distance covered on the return trip = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Determine how far John is from home:**
   - John initially traveled 180 miles away from home.
   - He then traveled 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance traveled back = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Running speed is 6 miles per hour.
   - Time spent running is 2 hours.
   - Distance running: \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour.
   - Time spent walking is 4 hours.
   - Distance walking: \( 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \) miles.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially from the total used to find out how many were in the package.

First, we know that Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 Post-it notes at work.

Next, we know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining after using 220. We can set up the equation to find the total number of Post-it notes she had initially plus the ones she purchased:

\[ \text{Total Post-it notes} = \text{Initial Post-it notes} + \text{Post-it notes in the package} \]

Given:
- Initial Post-it notes = 80
- Post-it notes used = 220
- Post-it notes remaining = 23

We can express the total number of Post-it notes as:
\[ \text{Total Post-it notes} = 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Now, we can find the number of Post-it notes in the package:
\[ \text{Post-it notes in the package} = \text{Total Post-it notes} - \text{Initial Post-it notes} \]
\[ \text{Post-it notes in the package} = 243 - 80 = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package is:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. The cost of each blue tie is $40, so:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + 50% of the cost of each blue tie
Cost of each red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40
Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20
Cost of each red tie = $60

Now, we calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-leveled sandcastle, we need to determine the square footage of each level and then calculate the average.

1. The top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16.
2. The level below it (Level 3) will have twice the square footage of Level 4, so:
   \[
   \text{Square footage of Level 3} = 16 \times 2 = 32
   \]
3. The next level (Level 2) will have twice the square footage of Level 3, so:
   \[
   \text{Square footage of Level 2} = 32 \times 2 = 64
   \]
4. The bottom level (Level 1) will have twice the square footage of Level 2, so:
   \[
   \text{Square footage of Level 1} = 64 \times 2 = 128
   \]

Now, we sum the square footages of all levels:
\[
16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

1. **First 180 days:**
   - The puppy is fed 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - Total dog food needed for 180 days: \( 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \).

2. **Remaining days of the year:**
   - A year has 365 days.
   - Remaining days after the first 180 days: \( 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \).
   - The puppy is fed 2 cups of dog food per day for these remaining days.
   - Total dog food needed for 185 days: \( 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \).

3. **Total dog food needed for the first year:**
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days: 180 cups.
   - Total dog food for the remaining 185 days: 370 cups.
   - Total dog food for the year: \( 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \).

4. **Number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags required: \( \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \).

"First, we need to determine how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Solving for David's laundry:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying the flowers in packages of 3 and in packages of 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 3 = 6 packages.
- The total cost for 6 packages is 6 * $2.50 = $15.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.00.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 2 = 9 packages.
- The total cost for 9 packages is 9 * $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, we compare the two total costs:
- The cost for packages of 3 is $15.00.
- The cost for packages of 2 is $9.00.

The savings by buying the flowers in packages of 2 instead of packages of 3 is:
$15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add Grace's and Alex's weights to find their combined weight:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} \]

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The team played 22 games in total.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \) using the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the 20 cars that drove through in the next 15 minutes:
\[ x + 20 \]

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (the cars that took an exit).

The total number of cars initially on the motorway is the sum of the cars that drove through and the cars that did not drive through:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]

"First, let's determine the total number of potted plants Mary has initially. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which gives us:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, she received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary decides to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of doorbell rings made by each of Jerome's friends and then sum them up.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   20 + \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 20\right) = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}
   \]

Now, we sum up the total number of doorbell rings:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first determine the inner dimensions of one box and then calculate the volume.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume of one box = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
   - Inner volume of one box = \( 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × Number of boxes

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can break down the total time he spent watching TV each day and then solve for the unknown.

1. **Monday and Tuesday:**
   - Each day, he watched a 1-hour episode.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes he watched.
   - Total time on Wednesday: \(0.5x\) hours.

3. **Thursday:**
   - He watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.

4. **Friday:**
   - He watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

5. **Total time spent watching TV:**
   - Sum of all days: \(2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\) hours.

Now, we can set up the equation and solve for \(x\):

\[
2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7
\]

Combine the constants:

\[
5.5 + 0.5x = 7
\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[
0.5x = 1.5
\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[
x = 3

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Julia rowed:**
   - Julia took 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - The shore was 64 seconds away.
   - The total distance rowed is calculated by:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of water taken on per foot rowed:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - Therefore, the amount of water taken on per foot is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

**Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.**

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.

\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L \approx 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

**Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary four years later increased by 40% from his salary four years ago.

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 56000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.**

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we need to find the percentage increase in Adrien's salary and apply it to Lylah's salary.

Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 12307.692 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} \approx 43076.92 \]

**Step 4: Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.**

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary four years later} \approx 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $99,076.92.

"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments based on her speed changes.

1. For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in the first 3 hours: \( 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \).

2. After the first 3 hours, she runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours (since 7 hours total - 3 hours already run = 4 hours).
   - Distance covered in the next 4 hours: \( 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \).

3. Total distance covered in 7 hours:
   - Total distance = Distance in first 3 hours + Distance in next 4 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, we convert the distances from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to get home using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For Steve:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

For Tim:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

The difference in their times is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} - \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 8 \) back into \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities:
     \[
     \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

4. **Expressing the result as a percentage:**
   - To express this as a percentage, we convert the ratio to a percentage:
     \[
     2 \times 100\% = 200\%
     \]

Thus, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage based on the total amount of straw distributed and the distribution details provided.

1. **Calculate the total straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces of straw.

2. **Calculate the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces of straw.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed among all the small rodents is 160 pieces.
   - Total straw for rats = Total straw - (Straw for hamsters + Straw for rabbits)
   - Total straw for rats = 160 pieces - (50 pieces + 20 pieces) = 90 pieces of straw.

4. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Number of rats = Total straw for rats / Straw per rat
   - Number of rats = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Number of rats in each cage = Total number of rats / Number of cages
   - Number of rats in each cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n periods, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the principal amount)
- \( r = 0.02 \) (the monthly interest rate, as a decimal)
- \( n = 1 \) (since interest is compounded monthly)
- \( t = 3 \) (the time in months)

Since the interest is compounded monthly, we can simplify the formula to:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

   - Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots.
   - There are 40 restaurants.
   - Total distributed = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds.

2. Subtract the total distributed from the total available:
   - Total available = 200 pounds.
   - Total distributed = 80 pounds.
   - Not used = 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds.

"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population. 

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - Number of men - Number of women
Number of children = 23786 - 8417 - 9092

Now, let's do the calculation:

23786 - 8417 = 15369
15369 - 9092 = 6277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277.

"To determine the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Cards collected in the third month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]

5. **Total number of cards:**
   Add the initial number of cards and the cards collected over the three months.
   \[
   20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320
   \]

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to break down the information given:

1. Mark edits 1000 sentences in total each week.
2. He edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.
3. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
4. Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence.

Now, we calculate the earnings from each publisher:

- Earnings from Publisher A: 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents
- Earnings from Publisher B: 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Total earnings in a week:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To determine how much money John made in the year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increased salary due to the 5% raise.

1. **Calculate the one-time monetary reward:**
   - John receives a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

2. **Calculate John's original annual salary:**
   - John makes $2000 per week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Original annual salary = $2000 * 52 = $104,000.

3. **Calculate the new weekly salary after the 5% raise:**
   - 5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100.
   - New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100.

4. **Calculate the new annual salary:**
   - New annual salary = $2100 * 52 = $109,200.

5. **Calculate the total amount of money John made in the year:**
   - Total money made = One-time monetary reward + New annual salary
   - Total money made = $5000 + $109,200 = $114,200.

"To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year.
2. Convert the total tons of grapes into barrels of wine.

First, we know that each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and Josie has 10 acres. So, the total tons of grapes produced per year is:
\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. Therefore, the total number of barrels of wine produced from 50 tons of grapes is:
\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

So, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year is:

"To determine the total number of cheese slices Carl used, we need to break down his cheese consumption for each meal and then sum it up.

1. **Lunch (sandwiches):**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Breakfast (omelets):**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Dinner (macaroni and cheese):**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for macaroni and cheese: \( 8 \text{ slices} \).

Now, we sum up the total cheese slices used for all meals:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 plates * $6000/plate = $36000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Calculate the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups = $34800 / 240 cups = $145.

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her initial savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Now, the remaining amount she needs to earn is:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the perimeter and Gary's walking speed into the formula:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now (in gallons).
Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now (in gallons).

We know that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, 4 minutes ago, each pool had 16 more gallons of water (since \( 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons} \)).

So, 4 minutes ago:
- The big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.
- The small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

To verify, substitute \( S = 8 \) back into the equation \( B = 4S \):
\[ B = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Check the conditions:
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 32 + 16 = 48 \) gallons.
- 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) gallons.
- 48 gallons is indeed twice 24 gallons, and 32 gallons is indeed four times 8 gallons.

Thus, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Since her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will need to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount.

The additional 10% of $2000 is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months if she pays $165 each month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:

Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Next, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers in the vase:

"First, let's determine the total number of Pokemon cards James has initially:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- James buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, we calculate the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

New total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.33\% \]

"First, we calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first visited the farm. 

30% of 120 watermelons were ready:
\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \text{ watermelons} \]

After taking these 36 watermelons, the remaining number of watermelons is:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \text{ watermelons} \]

When Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \text{ watermelons} \]

After harvesting these 63 watermelons, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested is:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ watermelons} \]

"To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Total tax = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

3. **Registration fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Total registration fees = 12 * $1,000 = $12,000.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the cars + Tax + Registration fees
   - Total cost = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000.

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section}

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate, which is 30% of the total weight.

\[
\text{Weight of wood eaten} = 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the flour needed for 36 cookies:
   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can set up a proportion to find out how much flour is needed for 36 cookies.
   - \(\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}\)
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 6 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. Calculate the flour needed for 30 cookies:
   - Similarly, we set up a proportion for 30 cookies.
   - \(\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}}\)

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. **Selling Price of the House:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \$350,000
   \]

2. **Brokerage Fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500
   \]

3. **Transfer Fee:**
   The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000
   \]

4. **Total Cost of the House:**
   The total cost is the sum of the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = \$409,500
   \]

5. **Comparison with Budget:**
   Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. We need to find out how much more the total cost is than her budget.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = \$9,500
   \]

Thus, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount he paid.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   - Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   - Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

2. **Calculate the brokerage fees:**
   - Brokerage fees = 5% of $400,000
   - Brokerage fees = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

3. **Calculate the total fees:**
   - Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fees
   - Total fees = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

4. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   - Total amount paid = Remaining loan amount + Total fees
   - Total amount paid = $250,000 + $32,000 = $282,000

5. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   - Net proceeds = Selling price - Total amount paid
   - Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the information given and calculate the lines for each part of his role.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines in the lyrics.
   - All 54 lines are his to memorize.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - The song has 54 lines, so the first scene has \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the first scene are \( \frac{108}{3} = 36 \) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - The song has 54 lines, so the second scene has \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the second scene are \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines.

"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the information that the sum of their current ages is 20.

1. **Current sum of their ages**: 20
2. **Years to add for each person**: 10 years

Since both Mico and Marco will each be 10 years older, we need to add 10 years to each of their current ages. This means we add 10 years twice (once for Mico and once for Marco).

3. **Total additional years**: 10 + 10 = 20

4. **Sum of their ages in 10 years**: 20 (current sum) + 20 (additional years) = 40

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of spots on all the snakes and then find half of that number.

1. First, we find the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots:
   \[
   \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras:
   \[
   \text{Total spots on cobras} = 70 \times 40 = 2800
   \]

3. Then, we calculate the total number of spots on all the mambas:
   \[
   \text{Total spots on mambas} = 35 \times 60 = 2100
   \]

4. We add the total spots on the cobras and the mambas to get the combined total:
   \[
   \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900
   \]

5. Finally, we find half of the total number of spots:

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

1. **Crates sold over the weekend**: 20 crates
2. **Crates sold on Tuesday**: 15 crates
3. **Crates sold on Wednesday**: 12 crates
4. **Crates sold on Thursday**: 18 crates

Now, let's add up all the crates sold:

\[ 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 \]

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:

\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.

"To determine how much Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to follow the sequence of the bids and calculate the final bid.

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. Each bid increases by $50.
3. Three other people each bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them.

Let's break down the bidding sequence:

- Opening bid: $200
- First person bids: $200 + $50 = $250
- Carmen bids: $250 + $50 = $300
- Second person bids: $300 + $50 = $350
- Carmen bids: $350 + $50 = $400
- Third person bids: $400 + $50 = $450
- Carmen bids: $450 + $50 = $500

Carmen wins the auction with her final bid of $500.

Therefore, the desk costs Carmen $500.

"To determine the total annual cost John pays for the driving service, we need to break down the expenses into two main components: the cost per mile and the monthly bonus.

1. **Cost per mile:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so a round trip is 60 miles.
   - He goes to work 5 days a week, so the weekly mileage is \( 60 \times 5 = 300 \) miles.
   - He works 50 weeks a year, so the annual mileage is \( 300 \times 50 = 15,000 \) miles.
   - The cost per mile is $2, so the annual cost for mileage is \( 15,000 \times 2 = 30,000 \) dollars.

2. **Monthly bonus:**
   - John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the annual bonus is \( 150 \times 12 = 1,800 \) dollars.

3. **Total annual cost:**
   - The total annual cost is the sum of the annual mileage cost and the annual bonus: \( 30,000 + 1,800 = 31,800 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for the driving service is:

"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from both his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

1. **Calculate the number of working days in April:**
   - April typically has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - There are 4 full weeks in April, plus 2 extra days (since 30 days / 7 days per week = 4 weeks and 2 days).
   - Therefore, Watson works 4 weeks * 5 days/week + 2 days = 22 days in April.

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - He earns $10 per hour.
   - Total hours worked in April = 22 days * 10 hours/day = 220 hours.
   - Total earnings from hourly wage = 220 hours * $10/hour = $2,200.

3. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - There are 4 full weeks in April.
   - Total bonus for April = 4 weeks * $300/week = $1,200.

4. **Calculate Watson's total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from hourly wage + Total bonus
   - Total earnings = $2,200 + $1,200 = $3,400.

Therefore, Watson made $3,400 in April.

"To determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
   - The bakery produces 60 loaves each day.
   - Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.
   - \( \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \) loaves are sold in the morning.

2. Determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales:
   - Total loaves produced: 60
   - Loaves sold in the morning: 40
   - Loaves left: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \)

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening:
   - Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening.
   - Half of the remaining 20 loaves: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \)
   - These 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so:
   - Loaves sold in the afternoon: \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \)

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week and then calculate how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, given her rate.

1. First, find out how much weight Joey loses in one week:
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.
   So, in one week, Joey loses \( \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \).

2. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

3. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we need to calculate:
   Sandy loses 2 pounds every 4 weeks.
   To lose 8 pounds, Sandy will need \( \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks} \).

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, the cost of the flight ticket:
$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

Adding up all the expenses so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to use for expenses and savings is:
$6000 (total money) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to use:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - Therefore, Noah's age six years ago was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20.
   - Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60,000 = \frac{P}{2}\).

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid (cream) added.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[

3. Calculate the monthly salary for senior programmers.
4. Calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers.
5. Calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers.
6. Sum the total monthly salaries for both junior and senior programmers.

**Step 1: Determine the number of junior programmers.**

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. The total number of employees is 100.

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

"First, let's determine how many rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars off} \]

This shopping trip, the customer spent $43. They used their $4 in rewards, and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of the rewards off the price. 

\[ \text{Coupon value} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars off} \]

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied to this shopping trip:

\[ \text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars off} \]

Subtract the total discount from the amount spent:

\[ \text{Amount paid} = 43 - 12 = 31 \]

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers.
2. Calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge.

First, we calculate the sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers.
- For 8 batches, he will need: \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

Next, we calculate the sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge.
- For 1 batch, he will need: \( 70 \text{ ounces} \).

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total sugar needed:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows Farmer Brown has, and then calculate the total number of legs.

1. Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \).
2. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
5. Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
6. Therefore, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \).
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \).

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of boys who were absent on Friday from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we know that 4 boys were absent on Friday. So, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
49"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and the number of boys is twice that of the girls, then there are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) boys in the park. Adding the number of girls and boys together, the total number of kids in the park is \(6 + 12 = 18\).

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
   - According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

2. **Number of people kicked out for shoplifting:**
   - The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is given by \( 4x - 5 \).
   - Substituting \( x = 3 \):
     \[
     4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
     \]

3. **Number of people kicked out for physical violence:**
   - The number of people kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of shoplifters.
   - Therefore, the number of people kicked out for physical violence is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

4. **Total number of people kicked out:**
   - The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons.
   - The total number of people kicked out is:
     \[
     3 + 7 + 21 + y = 50
     \]

5. **Solving for \( y \):**
   - Combine the known values:
     \[
     31 + y = 50
     \]
   - Subtract 31 from both sides:
     \[
     y = 50 - 31 = 19
     \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is \( 19 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the current points for Erin and Sara:**
   - Erin currently has 14 points.
   - Sara has 8 points.

2. **Understand the relationship between their points:**
   - Erin now has three times more points than Sara. This means Erin's points are 3 times Sara's points.

3. **Set up the equation based on the relationship:**
   - If Erin has 14 points and this is three times Sara's points, we can write the equation:
     \[
     14 = 3 \times 8
     \]
   - However, this equation is not correct because 14 is not three times 8. This suggests that the problem might be interpreted as Erin having 14 points more than three times Sara's points.

4. **Re-evaluate the problem statement:**
   - If Erin has 14 points and this is three times more than Sara's points, we need to find out how many points Erin had before scoring these 14 points.
   - Let \( E \) be the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points.
   - After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points are \( E + 14 \).

5. **Set up the correct equation:**
   - According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara:
     \[
     E + 14 = 3 \times 8
     \]
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     E + 14 = 24
     \]

6. **Solve for \( E \):**
   - Subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     E = 24 - 14
     \]
     \[
     E = 10
     \]

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of pairs sold each day and account for the returns.

1. **Friday:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Saturday:**
   - The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   - \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs of tennis shoes.

3. **Sunday:**
   - The store sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday.
   - \( 28 \div 2 = 14 \) pairs of tennis shoes.
   - However, 6 pairs were returned.
   - Therefore, the net sales for Sunday are \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs of tennis shoes.

4. **Total sales:**
   - Add the pairs sold on each day.
   - \( 14 \) (Friday) + \( 28 \) (Saturday) + \( 8 \) (Sunday) = \( 50 \) pairs of tennis shoes.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land equals 12.8 hectares.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. Then:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

"First, we determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we calculate:

Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26
Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is with only the female members, so initially, there are 26 girls performing.

On the day of the performance, half of the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can make it is:

Number of girls who can make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply that by his daily pay.

1. Calculate the number of days he works each month:
   - He works 6 days every week.
   - He works for 4 weeks every month.
   - Therefore, the number of days he works each month is \( 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month} \).

2. Calculate the number of days he works in a year:
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of days he works in a year is \( 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \).

3. Calculate his total earnings for the year:
   - He gets paid $50 every day.
   - Therefore, his total earnings for the year are \( 288 \text{ days/year} \times 50 \text{ dollars/day} = 14400 \text{ dollars/year} \).

Thus, the builder earns $14,400 in a year.

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily energy usage before reduction:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts (0.9 kilowatts) per hour.
   - Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy usage = 0.9 kW * 8 hours = 7.2 kW per day.

2. **Calculate the daily energy usage after reduction:**
   - Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, so he now uses the air conditioner for 3 hours a day.
   - Daily energy usage after reduction = 0.9 kW * 3 hours = 2.7 kW per day.

3. **Calculate the daily energy savings:**
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kW - 2.7 kW = 4.5 kW per day.

4. **Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:**

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns and cannolis in Allan's house.

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \).

Next, we account for the additional items Allan bought:

3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \( 40 + 60 = 100 \).
4. Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so the number of corns he bought is \( 100 - 40 = 60 \).

Now, we add the newly bought corns to the initial number of corns:

5. The new total number of corns is \( 80 + 60 = 140 \).

Finally, we find the combined total of corns and cannolis:

6. The combined total is \( 140 + 100 = 240 \).

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he walked 5,000 steps. He also walked 1,000 steps with his friend. After these activities, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we can subtract the steps he had already taken and the steps he had left to take from his total goal.

Total steps goal: 10,000 steps
Steps taken to and from school: 5,000 steps
Steps taken with his friend: 1,000 steps
Steps left to take: 2,000 steps

Steps taken during the jog = Total steps goal - (Steps taken to and from school + Steps taken with his friend + Steps left to take)
Steps taken during the jog = 10,000 - (5,000 + 1,000 + 2,000) = 10,000 - 8,000 = 2,000 steps

"First, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long, and each page averages 200 words. So, the total number of words is:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we calculate how long it will take Toby to read the book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. Therefore, the time required to read the book is:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, and it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. So, the total time he needs to account for is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (reading)} + 10 \text{ minutes (travel)} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby has 60 minutes available, the time he will be early is:

   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Hours per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (assuming a typical month)

   Total payment for one employee in May:
   \[
   15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Total payment for all employees in May:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

For her sister:
1. She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. She gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (camels + dromedaries) is 180.
2. The total number of humps (2 per camel + 1 per dromedary) is 304.

Let's denote:
- \( c \) as the number of camels.
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (total number of humps)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( c \):
\[ c = 180 - d \]

Next, substitute \( c \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - d) + d = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2d + d = 304 \]
\[ 360 - d = 304 \]
\[ d = 360 - 304 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 and saved $4, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 and saved $2, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.

\[ \text{Number of cards sold} \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100 \]

Kenny sold 100 cards. Since he kept 1/3 of his original collection, the 100 cards he sold represent the remaining 2/3 of his collection. Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with. We can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \]
\[ x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 36 - 18 = 18 hotdogs for the remaining guests who would have one hotdog each.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (for second hotdogs) + 18 (for one hotdog each) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short = 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest wanted a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of hotdogs short.
   - Therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Final answer: 26"
"First, we determine the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6.

Next, we calculate half of the letters in Indras' name:

"To find out how much Charlotte's order cost after the 20% discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.
2. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the final cost after the discount.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.**

- Set of pot and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Total cost before discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

**Step 2: Apply the 20% discount to the total cost.**

20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the final cost after the discount.**

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ 132.00 \]

132.00"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount George spent:**
   - George had $5 initially.
   - He had 1% of his money left, which means he had \( 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \) dollars left.
   - Therefore, the amount he spent is \( 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
   \[
   3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. Use the area formula for a rectangle to find the width. The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by:
   \[
   A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
   \]
   Given that the area \(A\) is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
   \[
   360 = 9 \times \text{width}
   \]
   \[
   \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it took James to complete the triathlon and then find out how long it took him to run.

First, let's calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Therefore, the time it takes James to swim is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time it takes James to run. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + x \]

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 180 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]

   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats)
- Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips required, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Since the result is a whole number, the farmer needs exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have five cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the combined length of the remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents.

First, convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet:
- Each remora is 6 inches long.
- There are 12 inches in a foot, so 6 inches is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet.

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
- \( 2 \times 0.5 \) feet = 1 foot.

Next, calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:
- The shark is 10 feet long.
- The combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.
- The percentage is \( \frac{1}{10} \times 100 = 10\% \).

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

1. **Number of kids allergic to dairy (A)**: 9
2. **Number of kids allergic to peanuts (B)**: 6
3. **Number of kids allergic to both (A ∩ B)**: 3

First, we calculate the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both (A ∪ B):

\[ A ∪ B = A + B - A ∩ B \]
\[ A ∪ B = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Next, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find out how many kids are not allergic to anything:

\[ \text{Total kids} - \text{Kids allergic to either or both} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is 20.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Brett's age in four years:**
   Brett is currently 14 years old. In four years, he will be:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Set up the equation for Angela's age:**
   In four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Brett is currently 14 years old, so three times his current age is:
   \[
   3 \times 14 = 42
   \]
   This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old.

3. **Determine Angela's current age:**
   If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, her current age is:
   \[
   42 - 4 = 38 \text{ years old}
   \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the morning rides:
   - Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
   - Each morning ride costs $6.
   - For 14 days, the total cost for morning rides is \( 2 \times 6 \times 14 \).

2. Calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
   - Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
   - Each afternoon ride costs $2.
   - For 14 days, the total cost for afternoon rides is \( 2 \times 2 \times 14 \).

3. Add the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to get the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of morning rides + Cost of afternoon rides.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Cost of morning rides:
   \[
   2 \times 6 \times 14 = 12 \times 14 = 168
   \]

2. Cost of afternoon rides:
   \[
   2 \times 2 \times 14 = 4 \times 14 = 56
   \]

3. Total cost:
   \[
   168 + 56 = 224
   \]

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $224 on driving his car during these two weeks.

"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, which is:

5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges

Now, let's find the total number of oranges they have together:

50 oranges (Ashley) + 70 oranges (Brianne) = 120 oranges

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is:

120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie = 40 pies

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost for each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:

\[ 200 = 20x \]

Divide both sides by 20:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Lily as \( L \), and by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (total insects collected)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( B = 2D \) and \( L = D + 7 \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Thus, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then convert that to yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

So, together they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Next, we need to convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein to yards. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we calculate:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273
\]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Suzie bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum (let's call the cost of each pack \( S \))
- 1 pack of grape gum for $2
- 1 pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar

The total cost of all the gum is $7. We can write the equation as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem:

- Let \( C_O \) represent the number of chairs Ophelia has.
- Let \( S_O \) represent the number of sofas Ophelia has.
- Let \( C_J \) represent the number of chairs Jenna has.
- Let \( S_J \) represent the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3C_O \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).

First, we solve for \( C_O \) using the information about Ophelia's sofas and chairs:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we find \( C_J \) using the relationship between Jenna's and Ophelia's chairs:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Now, we find \( S_J \) using the relationship between Jenna's sofas and chairs:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we first need to find out the cost of the headphone set.

1. Tom paid a total of $48.
2. The cost of one CD is $4.
3. Let the cost of the headphone set be \( H \).

From the information given:
\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

Solving for \( H \):
\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, we need to determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set.

The cost of one CD is $4, so the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:
\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the variations in his routine. Here's the breakdown:

1. Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for most of the weeks.
2. He worked out for 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks.
3. He worked out for 6 hours in one week.

First, calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours:
- There are 8 weeks in total.
- He worked out 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week, which totals 3 weeks.
- Therefore, the number of weeks he worked out 4 hours is \(8 - 3 = 5\) weeks.

Next, calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
- \(5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours}\).

Now, calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 5 hours:
- \(2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours}\).

Finally, calculate the total hours for the week he worked out 6 hours:
- \(1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

Add all these hours together to get the total:
- \(20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours}\).

Thus, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

2. On the first stop:
   - 8 passengers get off.
   - 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus.
   - Number of people getting on = 5 * 8 = 40.

   After the first stop:
   - People on the bus = 48 - 8 + 40 = 80.

3. On the second stop:
   - 21 passengers get off.
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on.
   - Number of people getting on = 21 / 3 = 7.

   After the second stop:
   - People on the bus = 80 - 21 + 7 = 66.

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the total cost of the printer and the monitors.

1. The cost of the computer is given as $1,100.
2. The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the cost of the printer is:
   \[
   1100 - 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   1100 + 2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} + 700 = 2400
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   1800 + 2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} = 2400
   \]
5. Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate the term with the cost of the monitors:
   \[
   2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} = 600
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for the cost of one monitor:
   \[
   \text{cost of one monitor} = 300
   \]

Thus, the cost of one monitor is \(300\) dollars.

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

1. Vlogs made in the first week: 18
2. Vlogs made in the second week: 21
3. Vlogs made in the third week: 15

Adding these together gives:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs in a month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To calculate how much you end up paying, first determine the total amount including the tip. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the total amount including the tip is:

\[ \text{Total} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since you are splitting the check evenly but paying the entire tip, you pay half of the original bill plus the full tip:

\[ \text{Your share} = \left( \frac{50}{2} \right) + 10 = 25 + 10 = 35 \]

Therefore, you end up paying $35.

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Set up the relationship between the savings in the two halves:**
   Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
   Then, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half of April.

4. **Calculate the total savings for each half:**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   The total savings for the month should equal his target of $1125.
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125
   \]

6. **Combine like terms and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45}
   \]
   \[
   x = 25

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes.
2. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

First, we know there are 7 buttons with two holes each. So, the total number of holes in these buttons is:
\[ 7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes per button} = 14 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the remaining buttons are:

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \), and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth. Therefore, for three teeth, the total is:
   \[
   3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since the previous amount was $1.00 per tooth, half of this amount is:
   \[
   \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per tooth}
   \]
   Therefore, for two teeth, the total is:
   \[
   2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
\boxed{9.00}

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
2. Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month.
3. Determine the difference between the total demand and the total supply.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month
Ford grows 40 roses every week. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

\[
40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 160 \text{ roses/month}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month
The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, the second orders 15 roses per week, and the third orders 30 roses per week.

\[
20 \text{ roses/week} + 15 \text{ roses/week} + 30 \text{ roses/week} = 65 \text{ roses/week}
\]

Now, calculate the total number of roses ordered in a month:

\[
65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 260 \text{ roses/month}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the difference between the total demand and the total supply
The total demand is 260 roses per month, and the total supply is 160 roses per month.

\[
260 \text{ roses/month} - 160 \text{ roses/month} = 100 \text{ roses/month}
\]

Thus, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to find the correct setting for 520 degrees.

1. **Determine the percentage error:**
   - The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it reaches 468 degrees.
   - The difference is \( 468 - 450 = 18 \) degrees.
   - The percentage error is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Percentage error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
     \]

2. **Apply the percentage error to the new temperature:**
   - The recipe calls for 520 degrees.
   - We need to find the setting \( x \) such that when the oven is set to \( x \), it actually reaches 520 degrees.
   - The relationship is:
     \[
     x + 0.04x = 520
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     1.04x = 520
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express these relationships mathematically as follows:

\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per day.
3. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

Step 1: Protein in 200 grams of mushrooms
- 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
- Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms contain \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) grams of protein.

Step 2: Daily protein intake
- John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.

Step 3: Weekly protein intake
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the total protein intake per week is \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) grams.

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then figure out how many hours he needs to work to cover the remaining amount after his deposit.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants will have a porcelain crown, which costs an additional $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Subtract the deposit from the total cost:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine how many hours George needs to work to earn the remaining amount:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - The number of hours he needs to work to earn $3900 is:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to pay for the dental work.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \). According to the problem, the angles in the triangle are \( x \), \( 2x \), and \( 3x \).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

   - Total from nickels: \( 14 \times 5 = 70 \) cents.

4. **Pennies:**
   - Each penny is worth 1 cent.
   - Colby has 15 pennies.
   - Total from pennies: \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) cents.

Next, we add up all the amounts to find the total amount of money Colby has:
\[ 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \] cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
\[ \frac{345}{5} = 69 \]

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Next, we calculate how many pounds Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly production as follows:

120 pounds * (3/4) = 90 pounds per hour

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each person can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

60 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds

For Marissa:

90 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

Finally, we add the total pounds of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa together:

720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds

"To determine how many years it will take before Jeremy needs to replace his tires, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/725 rotations}} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - Therefore, the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we first need to find the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. 

1. The bottle provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash.
2. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the number of washes will double because she is using half the amount of shampoo per wash. Therefore, the total number of washes will be:
   \[
   120 \times 2 = 240 \text{ washes}
   \]

3. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of washes:
   \[
   \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ washes}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per wash}
   \]

4. Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100:
   \[
   0.10 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 10 \text{ cents}
   \]

Thus, the cost per pump is 10 cents.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, we calculate the speed in kb per hour:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.
- Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second, so in one hour, she can download 20 kb/second * 3600 seconds = 72,000 kb.

Next, we convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour:
- Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the total kb by 1000 to get the speed in Mb.
- 72,000 kb / 1000 = 72 Mb.

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cars towed over the week, considering the different numbers of cars towed on different days.

1. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
   \]

2. For the remaining four days of the week, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars each day compared to the first three days. So, the number of cars towed each day for the remaining four days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
   \[
   6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
   \]

3. Adding the totals from the first three days and the remaining four days gives us the total number of cars towed for the week:
   \[
   30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Adam's current height is 40 inches. We need to find out how many more inches he needs to grow to reach 48 inches:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Adam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide the number of inches he needs to grow by the number of inches he grows per year:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Determine the total cost of acquiring the cars.
3. Calculate the profit from selling the cars.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost of acquiring the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit from selling the cars.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission based on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, James made:
\[ 17,500 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of riders who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet.
2. Calculate the number of women who can stay upright.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. 

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, while Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap at this rate. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and see how many absences would push the cost per class over $10.

1. **Total cost of the classes:** $60
2. **Total number of classes:** 10

If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is:
\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

His parents will not sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10. We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss such that the cost per attended class does not exceed $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per attended class is:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of customers Julie processes daily.
2. Calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel daily.
3. Calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel weekly.

First, we know that Jewel processes 50 customers daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers daily} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel daily:
\[ 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ customers daily} \]

Since they work all days of the week, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel weekly:
\[ 150 \times 7 = 1050 \text{ customers weekly} \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]"

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of four apples is $5.20. Therefore, the cost of one apple is:
\[ \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

The cost of three oranges is $3.30. Therefore, the cost of one orange is:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
- The cost for 5 apples is:
\[ 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
- The cost for 5 oranges is:
\[ 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

"To determine how much money Tim will make in a year after his promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise.
2. Calculate the annual salary based on the new monthly salary.
3. Add the bonus, which is half a month's salary, to the annual salary.

**Step 1: Calculate the new monthly salary.**

Tim's original monthly salary is $20,000. A 5% raise on this salary is calculated as follows:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 20000 = 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000 \]

So, the new monthly salary is:
\[ 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the annual salary based on the new monthly salary.**

The annual salary is the new monthly salary multiplied by 12:
\[ 21000 \times 12 = 252000 \]

**Step 3: Add the bonus to the annual salary.**

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is:
\[ \frac{21000}{2} = 10500 \]

Adding the bonus to the annual salary gives:
\[ 252000 + 10500 = 262500 \]

Therefore, Tim will make \(\boxed{262500}\) dollars in a year."

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the sales from green hats in the first month.
2. Calculate the total sales for the first month.
3. Calculate the total sales for the second month.
4. Sum the sales from both months to get the total amount made in two months.

**Step 1: Determine the sales from green hats in the first month.**

Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total sales for the first month.**

The total sales for the first month are the sum of the sales from red hats and green hats:
\[ \text{Total sales for the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total sales for the second month.**

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:
\[ \text{Total sales for the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

**Step 4: Sum the sales from both months to get the total amount made in two months.**

The total amount made in two months is the sum of the sales from the first month and the second month:
\[ \text{Total amount made in two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:
\[ \boxed{2100} \]"

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel over 12 months.

1. **Initial cost of the plane:**
   \[
   \text{Initial cost} = \$150,000
   \]

2. **Monthly cost to rent a hanger:**
   \[
   \text{Hanger rent per month} = \$5,000
   \]

3. **Monthly cost for fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Fuel cost per month} = 2 \times \text{Hanger rent per month} = 2 \times \$5,000 = \$10,000
   \]

4. **Total monthly maintenance cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly maintenance cost} = \text{Hanger rent per month} + \text{Fuel cost per month} = \$5,000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000
   \]

5. **Total maintenance cost for the first year:**
   \[
   \text{Total maintenance cost for 12 months} = 12 \times \text{Total monthly maintenance cost} = 12 \times \$15,000 = \$180,000
   \]

6. **Total cost for the first year:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Initial cost} + \text{Total maintenance cost for 12 months} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{330000}

"To solve the problem, let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, we calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, the cooking time for beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we add up the cooking times for all three items:
\[
30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total cooking time for all the food is:
\[
120

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Each animal has one head.
2. Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2 legs.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( S + G = 20 \)
2. The total number of legs: \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchases, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee.
2. Determine the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week.
3. Calculate the total cost of the coffee.
4. Add the cost of the donut to the total cost of the coffee.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee.
- The normal brand costs $5 per pound.
- The more expensive brand costs 20% more.
- 20% of $5 is \( 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \) dollar.
- Therefore, the more expensive brand costs \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) dollars per pound.

Step 2: Determine the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week.
- Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day.
- For a week (7 days), he needs \( 1 \times 7 = 7 \) pounds of coffee.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the coffee.
- The cost of 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \) dollars.

Step 4: Add the cost of the donut to the total cost of the coffee.
- The donut costs $2.
- The total cost is \( 42 + 2 = 44 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of everything is 44.

"The information provided in the question does not mention the cost of an apple pie. It only lists the items Gus bought and their prices. Therefore, based on the given information, it's not possible to determine the cost of the apple pie.

However, if the question is asking how much money Gus had left after his purchases, we can calculate that:

- 2 bags of chips cost: 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
- 1 bucket of fried chicken: $8.00
- 1 bottle of soda: $1.00

Total spent: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Gus started with $20.00, so the remaining amount is: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

If the apple pie was part of his purchase, and the question is asking how much he could have spent on the apple pie with the remaining money, the answer would be $7.00.

"James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs. There are 8 more dogs, so he needs to buy 8 toys to have enough for all 12 dogs. After buying the 8 toys, he finds that there are now twice as many dogs as when he left, meaning there are now 24 dogs (12 * 2). He then needs to buy 12 more toys to have enough for all 24 dogs. When he comes back, 3 dogs are gone, reducing the number of dogs to 21. Therefore, he no longer needs 3 toys, but he still has the 20 toys he has already bought (4 initial + 8 + 8).

So, the total number of toys James needs is 21, as he has 20 and needs 1 more to account for the 21 dogs.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20:
2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40

Let \( T \) represent the total bill. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so:
Heartworm check = 0.60 * \( T \)

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\( T = 40 + 0.60T \)

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\( T - 0.60T = 40 \)
0.40T = 40
\( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \)
\( T = 100 \)

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
$125 - $100 = $25

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes.

First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

Topher's shoe length in inches:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we use the given relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes. The problem states that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.

The relationship can be expressed as:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]
Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 90 = 9x \]
Divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- The total number of windows in the students' cars is \( 64 \times 4 = 256 \) windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows, so the number of windows smashed in the students' cars is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- The total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows, so the number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \) windows.

Finally, we sum the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students' cars) + 48 (teachers' cars) = 112 windows.

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashed is:

   - 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers

4. **Trading 50% of large stickers for large buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons

5. **Remaining large stickers:**
   - 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers

6. **Trading the remaining large stickers for small buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons

7. **Total small buttons after all trades:**
   - Remaining small stickers: 3
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total small buttons = 3 + 60 = 63 small buttons

8. **Total large buttons:**
   - From trading small stickers: 9
   - From trading large stickers: 20
   - Total large buttons = 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons

9. **Total buttons:**
   - Total small buttons: 63
   - Total large buttons: 29
   - Total buttons = 63 + 29 = 92

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:

\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is also 33. This can be expressed as:

\[ F + A = 33 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):

\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS):** 
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S):** 
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Number of students needing size small = 2 * 11 = 22.

3. **Medium (M):** 
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of students needing size medium = 22 - 4 = 18.

4. **Large (L):** 
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of students needing size large = 18 / 2 = 9.

5. **Extra-large (XL):** 
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of students needing size extra-large = 9 + 6 = 15.

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of orange fish he bought
- \( y \) as the number of white fish he bought

We know that:
\[ x + y = 17 \]

After adding the new fish to his pond, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Therefore, the total number of orange fish and white fish in the pond can be expressed as:
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + x \)
- Total white fish: \( 4 + y \)

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, expand the equation:
\[ 3 + x = 8 + 2y \]

Rearrange to isolate \( x \):
\[ x - 2y = 5 \]

We also have the equation:
\[ x + y = 17 \]

Now, we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( x - 2y = 5 \)
2. \( x + y = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 17 - y \]

Substitute \( x = 17 - y \) into the first equation:
\[ 17 - y - 2y = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3y = 5 \]
\[ -3y = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3y = -12 \]
\[ y = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify, substitute \( y = 4 \) back into the equation \( x + y = 17 \):
\[ x + 4 = 17 \]
\[ x = 13 \]

Now, check the condition:
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \)
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)

Indeed, 16 is twice 8, so the solution is correct.

The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the temperature at night.
2. Determine the temperature difference between the night temperature and the freezing point.
3. Calculate how many logs are needed to raise the temperature to above the freezing point.

First, we find the temperature at night:
- The temperature during the day is 45 degrees.
- It is 33 degrees colder at night.
- Therefore, the temperature at night is \( 45 - 33 = 12 \) degrees.

Next, we determine the temperature difference between the night temperature and the freezing point:
- The freezing point is 32 degrees.
- The temperature at night is 12 degrees.
- The difference is \( 32 - 12 = 20 \) degrees.

Finally, we calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees:
- Each log heats the house by 5 degrees.
- To raise the temperature by 20 degrees, Carson needs \( \frac{20}{5} = 4 \) logs.

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of groups formed.
2. Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of groups formed.**

The total number of people is 90, and each group consists of 9 people. Therefore, the number of groups is:
\[ \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.**

According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. So, the number of groups that brought back seashells is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups.**

Each of these 6 groups had 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:
\[ 6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108 \]

Thus, the total number of seashells brought back is:

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles currently has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together gives:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

We know the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( s \) in the equation:

\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, substitute \( z = 1 \) back to find \( s \):

\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

The amount of oil is \( 2s \):

\[ 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is 4 ounces.

"To find the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day.
2. Add the time from both days.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day:
\[ \text{Time on the second day} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the time from both days:
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we convert the total time from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ \text{Total time in minutes} = 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ 720 \]"

"To find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply by 7.

1. **Calculate the earnings per cycle:**
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Earnings per cycle = 5 tasks * $1.20/task = $6.00.

2. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - John does 30 cycles a day.
   - Daily earnings = 30 cycles/day * $6.00/cycle = $180.00.

3. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Weekly earnings = 7 days/week * $180.00/day = $1260.00.

Therefore, John makes $1260.00 in a full 7-day week.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

"To find out how many eggs Cindy had altogether, let's break down the information given:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. So, the number of blue eggs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs. So, the number of pink eggs is \(10 - 1 = 9\).
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. So, the number of yellow eggs is \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\).

Now, we add up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. First, he travels for 4 hours, and then for another 6 hours after taking some rest.

To find the total distance traveled, we calculate the distance for each part of the journey and then sum them up.

1. Distance traveled in the first 4 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. Distance traveled in the next 6 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then use that to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) (distance per hour).
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance, the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times v \times 18
     \]
     \[
     D = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the same distance:**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of 4 turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has and subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, meaning she is $50 short of the $400.

Let's calculate the total amount of money Erika has:
- Total money needed: $400
- Money from part-time job: $150
- Money from her mom: $80
- Money in her purse: \( x \)
- Total money she has: \( x + 150 + 80 \)

Since she is $50 short of $400, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food baskets.

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so each basket of red food effectively costs \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

3. Add the costs of the green and red food baskets to find the total cost:
   - Total cost = cost of green food baskets + cost of red food baskets
   - Total cost = \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:

"To determine how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned:**
   - There are 90 rooms in total.
   - One-half of the rooms is \( \frac{90}{2} = 45 \) rooms.

2. **Determine the time required to clean one room:**
   - It takes 20 minutes to clean each room.

3. **Calculate the total time required to clean 45 rooms:**
   - Total time in minutes = 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes.

4. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total time in hours = \( \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \) hours.

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. 

Each student needs 2 glue sticks, and there are 27 students:
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of 8 glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:
\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number:
\[ \lceil 6.75 \rceil = 7 \]

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day, starting with the initial 10 people and considering that each infected person infects 6 others every day.

**Day 0:**
- Initial infected people: 10

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 people infects 6 others.
- New infections: 10 * 6 = 60
- Total infected: 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 people infects 6 others.
- New infections: 70 * 6 = 420
- Total infected: 70 (from Day 1) + 420 (new) = 490

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 people infects 6 others.
- New infections: 490 * 6 = 2940
- Total infected: 490 (from Day 2) + 2940 (new) = 3430

Thus, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430.

"First, we calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we multiply 40 by 20:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips both received, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received is:

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly is buying:

- The total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, so each pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2.
- Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4.
- Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
- Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of item:

- The total cost for 6 packets of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.
- The total cost for 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
- The total cost for 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Adding up all the costs:

"To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of indoor plants:**
   - One-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants.
   \[
   \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining plants:**
   - Subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants.
   \[
   \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of outdoor plants:**
   - Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants.
   \[
   \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of flowering plants:**
   - The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants.
   \[
   \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of flowering plants:**
   - Divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
   \[
   \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of a thingamabob.
2. Use the speed of a thingamabob to find the speed of a whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the following equation to find the speed of a thingamabob:

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of a whatchamacallit}}{11} \]

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} \]

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of a whirligig as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of a thingamabob} \]

\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

Thus, the speed of a whirligig is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

1. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

2. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

3. **Determine the total payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
   - Since \( J \) represents the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, and she was paid $6, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem doesn't specify otherwise, and $6 is a reasonable payment for one mowing session).

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - If \( J = 1 \), then Tasha mowed Joe's lawn 1 time, Kamala's lawn 3 times, and Alba's lawn 5 times.
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 \) times.
   - Assuming the payment for each mowing session is the same as Joe's, the total payment for mowing lawns is \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) dollars.

Therefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after Calvin and his family have eaten dinner, and then figure out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftovers.

1. **Total Soup Capacity:**
   - The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

2. **Family Composition:**
   - Calvin (1 adult)
   - Calvin's wife (1 adult)
   - Two children (2 children)

3. **Soup Consumption for Dinner:**
   - Each adult eats 1 bowl.
   - Each child eats 1 bowl.
   - Total bowls needed for dinner: 1 (Calvin) + 1 (wife) + 1 (child) + 1 (child) = 4 bowls.

4. **Determine the Type of Bowls Used:**
   - Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, and the family needs 4 bowls in total, they will use 4 adult bowls for dinner.

5. **Leftover Soup:**
   - The pot initially has enough soup for 4 adult bowls.
   - After dinner, all 4 adult bowls are used, so there is no soup left in terms of adult bowls.
   - However, we need to convert the leftover soup into child bowls to see if there are any leftovers.

6. **Conversion of Soup:**
   - 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls.
   - Since all 4 adult bowls are used, there is no leftover soup in terms of adult bowls, and thus no leftover soup in terms of child bowls.

Therefore, there are no leftover bowls of soup for the children to have for lunch.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we need to calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the material needed for small masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Calculate the material needed for large masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

3. **Sum the material needed for both types of masks:**
   - Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
   - Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

Therefore, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices Abby and Josh eat together each day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by this daily consumption.

1. Abby eats 2 slices a day.
2. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.
3. Together, Abby and Josh eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day.
4. The loaf has 24 slices.

To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together each day:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many cups are used for chamomile and mint tea. Lana has a total of 27 cups and uses 15 of them for cinnamon tea. This leaves:

27 - 15 = 12 cups for chamomile and mint tea.

These 12 cups are divided equally into 3 rows, so each row has:

12 / 3 = 4 cups of chamomile and mint tea combined.

Since each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

4 / 2 = 2

Therefore, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to first understand how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.

Given:
- Each trip takes 4 hours.
- The sloth has 8 hours available.

First, calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:
\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick up per trip to collect a total of 24 berries in 2 trips:
\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is:

"First, we determine the amount of water Anthony and his father fill into the tank, which is half the amount of water in the pool. The pool has 10,000 gallons, so:

\[ \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so:

\[ \text{Water used in 6 days} = 500 \times 6 = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we find the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days by subtracting the water used from the initial amount in the tank:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \]

"To find the total number of calories in the mini pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin.
3. Multiply the calories of a mini cinnamon roll by the number of mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Multiply the calories of a mini blueberry muffin by the number of mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

First, we calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Calories in a mini cinnamon roll = 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Next, we calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Calories in a mini blueberry muffin = 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we calculate the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls:
- Number of mini cinnamon rolls = 200.
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls = 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, we calculate the total calories for the mini blueberry muffins:
- Number of mini blueberry muffins = 300.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins = 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the total distance each vehicle traveled.

1. **Distance traveled by the bus:**
   - Speed of the bus: 60 miles per hour
   - Time traveled by the bus: 5 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the car:**
   - Speed of the car: 30 miles per hour
   - Time traveled by the car: 8 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

"To determine how many new tables the charity group needs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people.
2. Add the 10 boxes of stuff they already have to the total from step 1.
3. Determine the total number of tables required to fit all the boxes.
4. Subtract the number of tables they already own from the total number of tables required to find out how many new tables they need.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people.
- Each person donates 5 boxes.
- There are 10 people.
- Total boxes donated = 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes.

Step 2: Add the 10 boxes of stuff they already have.
- Total boxes = 50 boxes (donated) + 10 boxes (already have) = 60 boxes.

Step 3: Determine the total number of tables required to fit all the boxes.
- Each table can fit 2 boxes.
- Total tables required = 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables.

Step 4: Subtract the number of tables they already own from the total number of tables required.
- They already own 15 tables.
- New tables needed = 30 tables (required) - 15 tables (owned) = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables.

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]
Thus, each sheep needs:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]
With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives the total amount of hay required:
\[ 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time James spends swimming the initial distance:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = \( 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Rest time = \( 6 \) hours / 2 = \( 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - Half of 2 miles per hour = \( 1 \) mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 8 \) miles / \( 1 \) mile per hour = \( 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Initial swimming time + Rest time + Remaining swimming time

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine how many reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spends stapling.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Calculate the total number of reports stapled based on the number of 15-minute intervals.

First, calculate the total time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM:
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Convert 15 hours into minutes:
- 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Next, determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- 900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

Now, calculate the total number of reports stapled:
- Vince staples 30 reports per 15-minute interval.
- 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier than usual.

1. **Total sleep time without interruptions:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time she woke up earlier:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Usual wake-up time: 6 a.m.
   - New wake-up time: 5:55 a.m.
   - 5 minutes.

4. **Total time subtracted from sleep:**
   - Time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Time woke up earlier: 5 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted: 23 + 5 = 28 minutes.

5. **Total sleep time on the bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted: 28 minutes.
   - Total sleep time on the bed: 480 - 28 = 452 minutes.

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. 

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups. 

To find the number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has initially:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Number of measuring spoons} = 24 + 16 = 40 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we subtract these from the total number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils remaining:
\[ \text{Total utensils remaining} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we add the number of patients admitted to the initial number of occupied beds to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

"To determine how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total emails sent per day**: 16
2. **Work emails**: 7

   Subtract the work emails from the total emails to find the remainder:
   \[
   16 - 7 = 9
   \]

3. **Emails to family**: Two-thirds of the remainder (9 emails) are to family:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]

4. **Other emails**: Subtract the emails to family from the remainder to find the other emails:
   \[
   9 - 6 = 3
   \]

5. **Emails to boyfriend**: One-third of the other emails (3 emails) are to her boyfriend:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1
   \]

Thus, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"First, we determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we calculate:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

Next, we determine Shawna's father's age. Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we calculate:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number but overstated this by 20%, we can find the actual number of people by calculating what 100% (the real number) would be. 

First, we recognize that Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number. We can set up the equation:

\[ 48 = 1.20 \times \text{actual number} \]

To find the actual number, we divide both sides by 1.20:

\[ \text{actual number} = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

\[ \text{actual number} = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of holes dug by the pirates and then find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.
   - At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes.
   - Therefore, by the end of the fourth day, the island had:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Total holes by the end of the fourth day: 40 holes
   - Total holes by the end of the third day: 29 holes
   - Holes dug on the fourth day:
   \[
   40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}
   \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokemon:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

We can substitute \( X \) and \( S \) in the first equation using the second and third equations.

First, substitute \( X \) from the second equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation:
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the third equation to find \( S \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]
Simplify:
\[
S = 160 - 13
\]
\[
S = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To determine how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of episodes in the show.
2. Calculate the total time spent watching all episodes.

First, we know that each episode is 20 minutes long. According to the problem, the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[ \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the total time spent watching all episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time is:

\[ \text{Total time} = 20 \text{ minutes/episode} \times 10 \text{ episodes} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time John will spend watching the show is:

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles south.

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles north.
   - Net distance after this leg = 300 miles south - 36 miles north = 264 miles south.

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles south.
   - Net distance after this leg = 264 miles south + 110 miles south = 374 miles south.

Thus, the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially.
2. Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party.

First, let's convert all quantities to individual brownies (1 dozen = 12 brownies):

- Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
- She brought home 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
- Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she had initially:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we need to account for the brownies eaten during the party:
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten: \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\) brownies.

Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

"To determine the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the process into two parts: peeling and sautéing.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we calculate the time required:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, we calculate the time required:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time to peel and the time to sauté:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner running for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.
- Total warming: \( 4 \) degrees.

The net change in temperature is:
- \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees.

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of trips the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips.

2. **Calculate the number of trips to Greece:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - Number of trips to Greece = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips.

3. **Calculate the number of trips to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - Number of remaining trips = \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.
   - Since these 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, the number of trips to France = \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) trips.

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: 3 years
- Alessandro: 4 years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

The total age of the children is:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the size of each slice of watermelon relative to the whole watermelon, given the conditions.

1. Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \).
2. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is:
- 4 kids' slices: \( 4x \)
- 2 adults' slices: \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \)

So, the total watermelon is divided into:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

3. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   \[
   \text{Total second day} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank before these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 0.07 \times 3x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.79x = 28 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{28}{0.79} \approx 35.44\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank before these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 0.09 \times 5y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is 35.44%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.55y = 35.44 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{35.44}{0.55} \approx 64.44\%
     \]

Thus, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 64.44%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment.
2. Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.
3. Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.
4. Determine how many weeks it will take for Janet to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate the down payment amount.**
The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.**
Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips.
\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.**
Janet works 40 hours a week.
\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment.**
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up these amounts to find the total spent so far:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine the rate at which he reads and then use that rate to calculate the time spent reading 18 pages.

First, we know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. This means his reading rate is:
\[ \text{Reading rate} = \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ pages per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We can use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Number of pages}}{\text{Reading rate}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{0.3 \text{ pages per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then scale that up to 40 dwarves over 30 days.

1. **Determine the amount of ore a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total amount of ore mined by one dwarf in 30 days:**
   - One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds per day.
   - Over 30 days, one dwarf mines \( 36 \times 30 = 1080 \) pounds of ore.

3. **Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in 30 days:**
   - If one dwarf mines 1080 pounds in 30 days, 40 dwarves will mine \( 1080 \times 40 = 43200 \) pounds of ore.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is 43200 pounds.

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst:

40% of 25 = 0.40 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

25 - 10 = 15 red balloons

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons:

Half of 12 = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her clutch:

75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added

Now, let's sum up all the balloons Sally carried into the school:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there is a substitute, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework: 100% or 1.00

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If the normal teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give an extension: 40% or 0.40
   - If the normal teacher is there and does not give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment: 20% or 0.20

Let's calculate the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework in the normal teacher scenario:
- Probability of normal teacher and giving an extension: \(0.50 \times 0.40 = 0.20\)
- Probability of normal teacher and not giving an extension but Marcus convinces her: \(0.50 \times 0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.06\)

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Total probability of not turning in homework: \(0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76\)

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:
- \(1 - 0.76 = 0.24\) or 24%

   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles.

2. **Determine the time to move between bottles:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

3. **Calculate the total time to move between all bottles:**
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = 7 pairs * 5 seconds per pair = 35 seconds.

4. **Add the time to drop the candy in the first bottle:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he needs to drop the candy in the first bottle before moving to the next.
   - Time to drop the candy in the first bottle = 0 seconds (since he starts there).

5. **Calculate the total time:**

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Jim needs pieces that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

The length of each piece of fabric:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

The width of each piece of fabric:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Twice the amount he lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - He won $1 more than this: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   - Net change: +$11

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race: $11
   - Loss in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)
   - Net change: -$16.5

Now, let's calculate the total net change for the day:
- First race: -$5
- Second race: +$11
- Third race: -$16.5

Total net change:
\[
-5 + 11 - 16.5 = -10.5
\]

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net change by the number of races:
\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{-10.5}{3} = -3.5
\]

Thus, Johnny's dad lost an average of $3.50 per race.

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To determine the number of laundry loads Greg does in a year, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Weekly Laundry Calculation:**
   - Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed.
   - He washes 2 twin sets of sheets per load and 1 king set of sheets per load.

2. **Twin Sheets:**
   - He has 4 twin beds, so he needs to wash 4 twin sets of sheets each week.
   - Since he can wash 2 twin sets per load, he will need:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads for twin sheets}
     \]

3. **King Sheets:**
   - He has 1 king size bed, so he needs to wash 1 king set of sheets each week.
   - Since he can wash 1 king set per load, he will need:
     \[
     1 \text{ load for king sheets}
     \]

4. **Total Weekly Loads:**
   - Adding the loads for twin sheets and king sheets:
     \[

"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each spent, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which took 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week.
2. Determine the daily banana consumption for the first and second monkeys.
3. Subtract the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find the daily consumption of the third monkey.

First, we know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315 bananas.

Next, we calculate the daily banana consumption for the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Now, we calculate the total daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day.
- The second monkey eats 14 bananas per day.
- Together, they eat \(10 + 14 = 24\) bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315, we can find the total daily consumption for all three monkeys:
- Total daily consumption for all three monkeys: \(315 \div 7 = 45\) bananas per day.

Finally, we subtract the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find the daily consumption of the third monkey:
- Daily consumption of the third monkey: \(45 - 24 = 21\) bananas per day.

Thus, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms left after the velociraptors had their share.

2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. Therefore, the 270 kilograms is half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors ate, there were:
   \[
   270 \times 2 = 540 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. Therefore, the 540 kilograms is half of the original amount of meat on the triceratops. So, before the T-Rex ate, there were:

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. According to the problem, Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran. Since Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Next, we add the distances run by Amber and Micah to find the total distance they both ran:

Total distance run by Amber and Micah = Amber's distance + Micah's distance
Total distance run by Amber and Micah = 8 + 28
Total distance run by Amber and Micah = 36 miles

The total distance run by all three is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the overall total:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - Total distance run by Amber and Micah
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge of $85.00.
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item, which is $15.00.
3. Calculate the discounted price of the frying pan:
   - The original price of the frying pan is $20.00.
   - The discount is 20%, so the discount amount is 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00.
   - The discounted price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. Calculate the discounted price of the set of towels:
   - The original price of the set of towels is $30.00.
   - The discount is 10%, so the discount amount is 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00.
   - The discounted price of the set of towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Add the discounted prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. After return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. Frying pan: $16.00
4. Set of towels: $27.00

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

3. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
4. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

First, we need to find out how many eggs Sarah and Camden each painted. Let \( S \) represent the number of eggs Sarah painted. Then, Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs. According to the problem, the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is 30:

\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs Arnold and Madeline each painted. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, let \( A \) represent the number of eggs each of them painted. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56:

\[ A + A + 9 + 21 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

4. Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
5. Add the total weight of the crayons and the boxes.
6. Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.

Step 1: Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons.
Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to separate them into groups of 8.
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of boxes needed.
Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, the number of boxes needed is 25.

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons.
\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes.
\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 5: Add the total weight of the crayons and the boxes.
\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 6: Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.
There are 16 ounces in a pound.
\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking the 3 miles, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

1. **Determine Grandma's speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

2. **Determine Grandma's speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * 0.05 miles per minute = 0.1 miles per minute.

3. **Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk:**
   - Distance on the sidewalk = 1 mile.
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug (33 degrees).
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug (unknown).
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to determine how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's break this down:

- 3 less than 6 potatoes is:
  \[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
- 1 less than 3 scoops is:
  \[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Thus, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The first two complexes each have 200 apartments.
   - Combined, the first two complexes have \( 200 + 200 = 400 \) apartments.
   - The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes.
   - 60% of 400 is \( 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \).
   - Therefore, the third complex has \( 400 + 240 = 640 \) apartments.

2. **Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from:**
   - The first complex has 200 apartments.
   - The second complex has 200 apartments.
   - The third complex has 640 apartments.
   - Total number of apartments is \( 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of collections per week:**
   - John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment.
   - Total collections per week is \( 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \).

4. **Calculate the total earnings per week:**
   - John gets paid $0.40 per collection.
   - Total earnings per week is \( 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \).

Therefore, John makes \(\boxed{1248}\) dollars in a week."

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 3 \times 50 = 150 \) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 7 \times 50 = 350 \) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - First, we need to find the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree.

5. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 20 \times 50 = 1000 \) fruits.

6. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) fruits.

7. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

8. **Summing up the fruits produced each year:**
   - Year 5: 50 fruits
   - Year 6: 150 fruits
   - Year 7: 350 fruits

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \), the length of the red rope as \( R \), and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R \) from the first equation into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Next, substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, substitute \( Y = 12 \) back into the second equation to find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ B = 12 - 7 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Finally, substitute \( B = 5 \) into the first equation to find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B \]
\[ R = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]
   - Simplify the right side:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

3. **Amount Left in Ronnie's Money:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to their little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount left in Ronnie's money is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

The final amount left in Ronnie's money is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Paint Used**: The mural used 12 pints of paint in total.

2. **Yellow Paint**: Half of the mural is yellow. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint used is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

3. **Remaining Paint**: The remaining half of the mural is painted with red, white, and purple. Since the total paint used is 12 pints, the remaining paint is:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

4. **Equal Amounts of Red, White, and Purple**: The remaining 6 pints are divided equally among red, white, and purple. Therefore, the amount of each color (red, white, and purple) is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
   \]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
2 \text{ pints}

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing 10 Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to track the length of the chalk piece each day until it becomes smaller than 2 inches.

1. **Initial length of the chalk on Monday**: 5 inches.
2. **Chalk used on Monday**: 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.
3. **Remaining length after Monday**: 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Starting from Tuesday, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

4. **Tuesday**:
   - Chalk used: 20% of 2.75 inches = 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches.
   - Remaining length: 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 inches.

5. **Wednesday**:
   - Chalk used: 20% of 2.20 inches = 0.20 * 2.20 = 0.44 inches.
   - Remaining length: 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 inches.

By the end of Wednesday, the remaining length of the chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk at the end of Wednesday.

The number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the piece of chalk is 2 days (Tuesday and Wednesday).

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, expand the first equation:
\[
W = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school gets.

First, we find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that 100 books cost $500. Therefore, the cost per book is:
\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:
\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is distributing the books equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:
\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

"To determine how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to track the usage and orders over the three days and then work backwards.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
   - At the end of the first day, they had \( x - 38 + 50 \) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - They did not order any bandages on the second day.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \( (x - 38 + 50) - 28 \) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they received \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) bandages.
   - At the end of the third day, they had \( ((x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100) - 25 \) bandages.

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
((x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100) - 25 = 78
\]

Simplify the equation step by step:

\[
(x + 12) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance walked by the dogs. The average distance is the total distance walked by all dogs divided by the number of dogs.

Given:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.
- The average distance walked by the dogs is 3 miles per day.
- There are 4 dogs in total.

First, we calculate the total distance walked by all dogs:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Average distance} \times \text{Number of dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 3 \, \text{miles/dog} \times 4 \, \text{dogs} = 12 \, \text{miles} \]

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we first need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs.

Given:
- 16 meatballs are made from 1 pound of ground beef.
- Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs.

First, calculate the number of pounds of ground beef needed:
\[ \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is:
\[ \text{Total seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Thus, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

2. **Set Up the Relationship:**
   - According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
     \[
     b = 3c - 2
     \]

3. **Total Treats:**
   - Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
     \[
     5 \times 2 = 10
     \]

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies:
     \[
     c + b = 10
     \]

5. **Substitute the Relationship:**
   - Substitute \( b = 3c - 2 \) into the equation \( c + b = 10 \):
     \[
     c + (3c - 2) = 10
     \]

6. **Solve for \( c \):**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     4c - 2 = 10
     \]
   - Add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     4c = 12
     \]
   - Divide by 4:
     \[
     c = 3
     \]

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of seeds in a small sunflower.
2. Calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower.
3. Add the number of seeds from both the small and large sunflowers to find the total.

First, we know that a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, we calculate:
\[ 3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 36 = 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower gives us the number of seeds in a large sunflower:
\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Finally, to find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds from both:
\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

Thus, the total number of sunflower seeds is:
90"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes a day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

2. **Determine the net number of holes filled each day after Nate returns:**
   - Nate fills 9 holes a day.
   - The dog digs 6 new holes each night.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. Let's break down the information given:

1. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
2. Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 2 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
4. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know the following:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- Chickens have 2 legs each.
- Cows have 4 legs each.
- The total number of legs is 70.

We can write the equations as:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.
