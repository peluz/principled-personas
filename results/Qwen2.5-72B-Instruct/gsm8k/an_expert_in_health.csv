"To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance John initially travels:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Determine the distance John needs to travel back home:**
   - John needs to travel 180 miles back home.

3. **Analyze John's return trip:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles in this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

4. **Calculate the total distance John covers on his return trip:**
   - Total distance covered = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

5. **Determine how far John is from home:**
   - John initially traveled 180 miles away from home.
   - He has covered 135 miles on his return trip.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours.

First, let's identify the guesses:
- The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
- The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 80 plus 20 is 100.

So, the guesses are:
- First friend: 80
- Second friend: 60
- Third friend: 100

Next, we calculate the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3}
\]

Adding the guesses:
\[
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]

Dividing by the number of guesses (3):
\[
\frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is:
\[
80
\]

"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total hours per day John spends on the dogs.
2. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week.

Step 1: Total hours per day
Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of, and John has 10 dogs.
So, \( 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \).

Step 2: Total hours per week
There are 7 days in a week, so:
\( 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \).

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

"First, let's determine the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips:
- The bag has 5 servings.
- Each serving has 250 calories.
- Therefore, the total number of calories in the bag is \( 5 \times 250 = 1250 \) calories.

Next, let's find out how many calories you can still consume:
- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.
- Therefore, you can still consume \( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \) calories.

Now, let's determine how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories:
- Each serving is 250 calories and the bag is 300g, so each serving is \( \frac{300g}{5} = 60g \).
- To find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories, we use the ratio of calories to grams: \( \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} \times 60 \text{ grams/serving} = 48 \text{ grams} \).

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially from the total used to find out how many were in the package.

First, we know that Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. So, she used 220 Post-it notes in total.

Next, we know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining after using 220. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. The number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is the difference between the total number of Post-it notes she had and the number she initially had:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. The cost of each blue tie is $40, so:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + 50% of the cost of each blue tie
Cost of each red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40
Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20
Cost of each red tie = $60

Now, we calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-leveled sandcastle, we need to determine the square footage of each level and then calculate the average.

1. The top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16.
2. The level below it (Level 3) will have twice the square footage of Level 4, so:
   \[
   \text{Square footage of Level 3} = 16 \times 2 = 32
   \]
3. The next level (Level 2) will have twice the square footage of Level 3, so:
   \[
   \text{Square footage of Level 2} = 32 \times 2 = 64
   \]
4. The bottom level (Level 1) will have twice the square footage of Level 2, so:

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

1. **First 180 days:**
   - The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - Total food for 180 days: \( 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \).

2. **Remaining days of the year:**
   - A year has 365 days.
   - Remaining days after the first 180 days: \( 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \).
   - The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day.
   - Total food for 185 days: \( 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \).

3. **Total food for the first year:**
   - Total food for the first 180 days: 180 cups.
   - Total food for the remaining 185 days: 370 cups.
   - Total food for the year: \( 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \).

4. **Number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups.
   - Number of bags required: \( \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \).

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"First, we need to determine how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Solving for David's laundry:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying the flowers in packages of 3 and in packages of 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 3 = 6 packages.
- The total cost for 6 packages is 6 * $2.50 = $15.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.00.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 2 = 9 packages.
- The total cost for 9 packages is 9 * $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, we compare the two total costs:
- The cost for packages of 3 is $15.00.
- The cost for packages of 2 is $9.00.

The savings by buying the flowers in packages of 2 instead of packages of 3 is:
$15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, solve for \( L \):
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substitute \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

3. 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the 20 cars that drove through in the next 15 minutes:
\[ x + 20 \]

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (the cars that took an exit).

The total number of cars initially on the motorway is the sum of the cars that drove through and the cars that did not drive through:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is:

"First, let's determine the total number of potted plants Mary has initially. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which gives:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, she received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary decides to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. This means she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70
   \]

Now, we sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is:

   - Total for Friday: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

5. **Total time spent watching TV:**
   - Sum of all days: \(2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\) hours.

Now, we can set up the equation and solve for \(x\):

\[
2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7
\]

Combine the constants:

\[
5.5 + 0.5x = 7
\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[
0.5x = 1.5
\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[
x = 3

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

**Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.**

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.

\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L \approx 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

**Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary four years later increased by 40% from his salary four years ago.

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 56000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.**

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we need to find the percentage increase in Adrien's salary and apply it to Lylah's salary.

Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 12307.692 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} \approx 43076.92 \]

**Step 4: Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.**

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary four years later} \approx 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $99,076.92.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of price increases**: Since the price increases every two months, we need to calculate how many two-month periods are in 36 months.
   \[
   \text{Number of increases} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
   \]

2. **Calculate the price after each increase**: Each increase is 20% of the original price, which means the price is multiplied by 1.20 (100% + 20%) after each increase. We can use the formula for compound interest to find the final price:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Increases}}
   \]
   Here, the original price is $20, the rate is 0.20, and the number of increases is 18.
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

3. **Compute the final price**:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 38.3376 \approx 766.752
   \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is $766.75.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.

- Number of favorable outcomes: 3 (4, 5, 6)
- Total number of possible outcomes: 6

The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.

- Probability of rolling an even number on the first roll: \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5\)
- Probability of rolling an even number on the second roll: \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5\)

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling two even numbers in a row) is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

To express this as a percentage:
\[
2 \times 100\% = 200\%
\]

Thus, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage based on the total amount of straw distributed and the distribution details provided.

1. **Calculate the total straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces of straw.

2. **Calculate the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw distributed.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces of straw.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - Total straw distributed among all rodents = 160 pieces.
   - Total straw used for hamsters and rabbits = 50 pieces (hamsters) + 20 pieces (rabbits) = 70 pieces.
   - Total straw used for rats = 160 pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Number of rats = Total straw for rats / Straw per rat = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Number of rats in each cage = Total number of rats / Number of cages = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage.

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n periods, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the principal amount)
- \( r = 0.02 \) (the monthly interest rate)
- \( n = 1 \) (since interest is compounded monthly)
- \( t = 3 \) (the time in months)

Since the interest is compounded monthly, we can simplify the formula to:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net number of trees added each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.

Step 1: Calculate the net number of trees added each year.
- Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year.
- Net number of trees added each year = 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

Step 2: Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
- Tom starts with 50 trees.
- Over 10 years, he adds 8 trees per year.
- Total number of trees added over 10 years = 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos on Friday morning:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Number of flamingos taken back and painted white on Saturday morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the 18 pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and put back out on the front yard.

3. **Number of pink and white flamingos on Saturday morning:**
   - Pink flamingos left: \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - White flamingos added: 6.

4. **Number of flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - Total pink flamingos: \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - Total white flamingos: 6.

5. **Difference between the number of pink and white flamingos on Sunday noon:**
   - Difference: \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Thus, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers and then sum them up.

1. First, we know that Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

2. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   \[
   500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Therefore, Publisher B pays:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence}
   \]
   For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   \[
   500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. To find the total earnings for the week, we add the earnings from both publishers:
   \[
   2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents}
   \]

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons) and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

   - Therefore, the travel time by car is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

3. **Total travel time:**
   - The total travel time is the sum of the travel time by bus and the travel time by car.
   - Total travel time = 6 days (by bus) + 3 days (by car) = 9 days.

Thus, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 9.

"First, let's determine the total number of Pokemon cards James has initially:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- James buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

Total new cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Converting to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:
\[ 33\% \]

"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of placing puzzle pieces and then use that to find the total time required.

1. **Determine Kalinda's rate:**
   - Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.

2. **Determine her mom's rate:**
   - Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.
   - Therefore, her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

3. **Calculate their combined rate:**
   - Combined rate = Kalinda's rate + Mom's rate
   - Combined rate = 4 pieces/minute + 2 pieces/minute = 6 pieces/minute

4. **Calculate the total time required to complete the puzzle:**
   - Total pieces to be placed = 360 pieces
   - Time required (in minutes) = Total pieces / Combined rate
   - Time required = \( \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \)

5. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**

   - Total cost of the cars = \( 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \) dollars.

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Total tax = \( 10\% \times 240,000 = 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000 \) dollars.

3. **Registration fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Total registration fees = \( 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the cars + Tax + Registration fees
   - Total cost = \( 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the initial pens Ram buys and the additional pens he can create by mixing the ink from the empty ones.

1. **Initial Pens**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Round of Mixing**: From the 25 empty pens, he can make 5 new full pens (since 5 empty pens make 1 full pen).
3. **Second Round of Mixing**: After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens, which he can mix to make 1 more full pen.
4. **Third Round of Mixing**: After using this 1 new pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another full pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is the sum of the initial pens and the additional pens made from mixing the ink:

"To determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the number of cookies each of them ate and then convert that into calories.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate on each day:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate:
  \[
  4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies}
  \]
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate:
  \[
  2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies}

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree.

First, calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it:
- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- The number of 10-foot sections in a 200-foot tree is \( \frac{200}{10} = 20 \) sections.
- Therefore, the total weight of the tree is \( 20 \times 400 = 8000 \) pounds.

Next, determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate:
- The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
- 30% of 8000 pounds is \( 0.30 \times 8000 = 2400 \) pounds.

Finally, subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree:
- The remaining weight of the tree is \( 8000 - 2400 = 5600 \) pounds.

Thus, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is 5600 pounds.

2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
4. Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_a = 52 \)

First, we use the information that Andrea has 52 apples to find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we use the number of apples Jamal has to find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies today:
   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can set up a proportion to find out how much flour is needed for 36 cookies.
   - \(\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}\)
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 6 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. Calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies tomorrow:
   - Similarly, we set up a proportion for 30 cookies.
   - \(\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}}\)
   - Solving for \(y\):
     \[
     y = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 5 \text{ cups}
     \]

3. Add the amounts of flour needed for both days:
   - Total flour needed = 6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines in the lyrics.
   - All 54 lines are his lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - The song has 54 lines, so the first scene has \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are his.
   - Therefore, the number of lines he has to memorize in the first scene is \( \frac{108}{3} = 36 \) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - The song has 54 lines, so the second scene has \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines.

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

"First, let's determine the total number of chocolate bars. There are 8 packets, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ bars/packet} = 40 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars the adults will receive. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars/adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them:
\[ 16 \text{ bars} \div 8 \text{ children} = 2 \text{ bars/child} \]

Thus, each child will get:
\[ 2 \]

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening Effect of Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of junior programmers.
2. Determine the number of senior programmers.
3. Calculate the monthly salary for senior programmers.
4. Calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers.
5. Calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers.
6. Sum the total monthly salaries for both junior and senior programmers.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees.
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]

2. The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

3. The monthly salary for senior programmers is $400 more than the monthly salary for junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Monthly salary for senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
   \]

4. Calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
   \]

5. Calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
   \]

6. Sum the total monthly salaries for both junior and senior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary for all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
   \]

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:
\[
224000

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, the number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got in. So, the number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, so:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"To find out how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Marisa receives in 5 days.
2. Calculate the total amount of money Marisa spends on lollipops in 5 days.
3. Subtract the total amount spent on lollipops from the total amount received to find the amount saved.

Step 1: Total amount received in 5 days
Marisa receives $5 each day. Over 5 days, she receives:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ dollars/day} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Total amount spent on lollipops in 5 days
Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. The cost of lollipops per day is:
\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 1 \text{ dollar/day} \]
Over 5 days, the total cost of lollipops is:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ dollar/day} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Total amount saved
The total amount saved is the total amount received minus the total amount spent on lollipops:
\[ 25 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Total cost of gumballs = 40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.00.

2. **Determine the amount of change Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy spent half of his change on gumballs, so the total change he had before buying gumballs is twice the amount he spent on gumballs.
   - Total change before buying gumballs = $2.00 * 2 = $4.00.

3. **Determine the amount of money Billy spent on candy:**
   - Billy started with $10 and had $4.00 left as change.
   - Amount spent on candy = $10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   - The candy costs $1.50 per pound.
   - Number of pounds of candy = $6.00 / $1.50 per pound = 4 pounds.

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total amount she will owe after the five months, including interest. The formula to calculate simple interest is:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
- Time (T) = 5 months (which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year)

First, calculate the interest:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.50 \]

Next, calculate the total amount to be paid back:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50 \]

Now, to find the monthly payment, divide the total amount by the number of months:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.50 \]

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.

He sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.

According to the problem, the amount of land he has left is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}

"First, we determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls:

Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26
Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is with just the female members, so initially, there are 26 girls performing.

On the day of the performance, half of the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can make it is:

Number of girls who can make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then compare it to the cost of the cable package.

1. **Cost of Netflix:**
   - Netflix costs $10 per month.

2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the bundle discount:**
   - Normally, each service costs $10 per month.
   - The total cost for both services without the discount is:
     \[
     10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - With a 20% discount, the total cost for both services is:
     \[
     20 \times (1 - 0.20) = 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total cost of all streaming services:**
   - Adding the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
     \[
     10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Savings by cancelling the cable package:**
   - The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.
   - The total cost of the streaming services is $26 per month.
   - The savings is:
     \[
     60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Tim saves \(\boxed{34}\) dollars per month by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to the streaming services."
"To find the percentage of the total work time Carol spent editing, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on all activities and then determine what portion of that time was spent editing.

1. Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
2. Time spent recording the song: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
3. Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Next, we calculate the total time spent on all activities:
Total time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

Now, we find the percentage of the total time spent editing:
Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100
Percentage spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100 = 20%

Therefore, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is 20%.

"To determine how many books Wendy will need, we first need to calculate the number of books that can be placed in the shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. 

The total number of books that can be placed in the shelving system is:
\[ 6 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ columns} = 36 \text{ books} \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double this number. So, we first calculate double the number of books:
\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]

Then, we add 20 to this number:
\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica had initially:

- She made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with 15 cards each, so 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

Adding these together, Erica initially had:
20 + 30 = 50 cards.

Next, we calculate the total number of cards she passed out:
- She passed out 24 to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 to her family.

So, the total number of cards passed out is:
24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, we subtract the number of cards passed out from the initial total:
50 - 29 = 21 cards.

Finally, we add the number of cards she received from family and friends:
21 + 17 = 38 cards.

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"First, we calculate the number of slices given to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill:
1/3 of 12 slices = 12 * (1/3) = 4 slices

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
1/4 of 12 slices = 12 * (1/4) = 3 slices

Next, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
4 slices (Bill) + 3 slices (Mark) = 7 slices

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we add these to the total number of slices given away:
7 slices (Bill and Mark) + 2 slices (Jenny) = 9 slices

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices:
12 slices (original) - 9 slices (given away and eaten) = 3 slices

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of each type of bug and then sum them up.

1. **Number of spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Number of millipedes**: Nancy saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders. Therefore, the number of millipedes is:
   \[
   \frac{90}{3} = 30
   \]
3. **Number of stink bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Therefore, the number of stink bugs is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, we sum up the total number of bugs:
\[
90 \text{ (spiders)} + 30 \text{ (millipedes)} + 48 \text{ (stink bugs)} = 168
\]

Thus, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

2. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth's age is:
   \[
   30 + 5 = 35 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is:
   \[
   35 + 7 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age:
\[
42 - 30 = 12 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years.

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he walked 5,000 steps. He also walked 1,000 steps with his friend. After these activities, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we can add the steps he had already taken (5,000 + 1,000) and the steps he had left (2,000) and subtract this total from his goal of 10,000 steps.

Steps taken before the jog: 5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with friend) = 6,000 steps
Steps left after the jog: 2,000 steps

Total steps accounted for before and after the jog: 6,000 (before) + 2,000 (after) = 8,000 steps

Steps taken during the jog: 10,000 (goal) - 8,000 (before and after) = 2,000 steps

3. **Remaining 10 months at $14 per month:**
   - 2 years is 24 months.
   - The first 6 months and the next 8 months account for 14 months.
   - Therefore, the remaining period is:
     \[
     24 \text{ months} - 14 \text{ months} = 10 \text{ months}
     \]
   - The cost for these 10 months is:
     \[
     10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
     \]

Now, we sum up the costs for all periods:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$140 = \$284
\]

Thus, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 and saved $4, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 and saved $2, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by both the homemade and store-bought bird feeders.

1. **Number of homemade bird feeders**: 3
2. **Number of store-bought bird feeders**: 3
3. **Birds attracted by each store-bought feeder**: 20
4. **Birds attracted by each homemade feeder**: 20 + 10 = 30

Now, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ homemade feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ store-bought feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Finally, we add the number of birds attracted by both types of feeders to get the total number of birds:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokemon cards Kenny started with. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs:**
   - The ticket to the amusement park costs $100.
   - He also wants to have $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he needs is:
     \[
     100 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of cards Kenny needs to sell to get $150:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards he needs to sell to get $150 is:
     \[
     \frac{150}{1.5} = 100 \text{ cards}
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2}{3}x = 100
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{3}{2} \) to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150
     \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, the caterer prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 36 - 18 = 18 hotdogs for the remaining guests who would only have one hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (for second hotdogs) + 18 (for first hotdogs) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short = 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest wanted a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of hotdogs short.
   - Therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Final answer: 26"

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
   \[
   3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. Use the area formula for a rectangle to find the width. The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by:
   \[
   A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
   \]
   Given that the area \( A \) is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width \( w \):
   \[
   360 = 9 \times w
   \]
   \[

"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples each person eats in 30 days.
2. Multiply the daily consumption by the number of days.
3. Add the total consumption of both individuals.

First, we calculate the number of apples each person eats in 30 days:
- Each person eats 4 apples a day.
- Over 30 days, each person eats \( 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \).

Next, we add the total consumption of both Marin and Nancy:
- Total apples eaten by both = \( 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \).

Therefore, the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days is 240.

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed:
\[ V = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of each type of card and then sum them up.

1. **Red Cards:**
   - There are 15 red cards.

2. **Green Cards:**
   - The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is calculated as \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).

3. **Yellow Cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - The sum of red and green cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).
   - Therefore, the number of yellow cards is 39.

4. **Total Number of Cards:**
   - The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards.
   - Total = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies:
8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies

Total number of puppies with spots:
3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating the percentage:

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. Finally, we will divide this total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Calculate the weight of each type of feed:**
   - **Sugar cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
   - **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
   - **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
   - **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

2. **Sum the total weight of all the feed:**
   - Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
   - Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds

3. **Determine the number of trips needed:**
   - The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
   - Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, each horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for all four horses:**
   - There are 4 horses.
   - Therefore, the total daily consumption for all horses is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total oats consumption for five days:**
   - The total consumption for 5 days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of 50-pound bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The number of bags needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Bodhi as \( B \), and by Lily as \( L \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, we substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( L \):

"To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky can pick per hour, we need to calculate the picking rate for each person and then sum these rates.

1. **Tony's picking rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.

2. **Bobby's picking rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony.
   - Bobby's rate = 6 quarts/hour - 1 quart/hour = 5 quarts/hour.

3. **Kathy's picking rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby.
   - Kathy's rate = 2 * 5 quarts/hour = 10 quarts/hour.

4. **Ricky's picking rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.
   - Ricky's rate = 10 quarts/hour - 2 quarts/hour = 8 quarts/hour.

5. **Total picking rate:**
   - Total rate = Tony's rate + Bobby's rate + Kathy's rate + Ricky's rate
   - Total rate = 6 quarts/hour + 5 quarts/hour + 10 quarts/hour + 8 quarts/hour
   - Total rate = 29 quarts/hour

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky can pick per hour is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person can paint a house.

1. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take the same person 10 days to paint a whole house.
2. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it takes one person to paint a whole house is:
   \[
   10 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 240 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. If one person takes 240 hours to paint a whole house, then the rate of one person is:
   \[
   \frac{1 \text{ house}}{240 \text{ hours}}
   \]
4. If 5 people are working together, their combined rate is:
   \[
   5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{240 \text{ hours}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{240 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{48 \text{ hours}}
   \]
5. Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem:

- Let \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has.
- Let \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has.
- Let \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.
- Let \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3C_O \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).

First, we solve for \( C_O \) using the information about Ophelia's sofas and chairs:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we find \( C_J \) using the relationship between Jenna's and Ophelia's chairs:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Now, we find \( S_J \) using the relationship between Jenna's sofas and chairs:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the variations in his routine:

1. Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for most of the weeks.
2. He worked out for 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks.
3. He worked out for 6 hours in one week.

First, calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours:
- There are 8 weeks in total.
- He worked out 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week, which totals 3 weeks.
- Therefore, the number of weeks he worked out 4 hours is \(8 - 3 = 5\) weeks.

Next, calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
- \(5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours}\).

Now, calculate the total hours for the 2 weeks he worked out 5 hours each:
- \(2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours}\).

Finally, calculate the total hours for the 1 week he worked out 6 hours:
- \(1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

Add all these hours together to get the total:
- \(20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours}\).

Thus, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000 in sales, the commission is 30%:
   \[
   1000 \times 0.30 = 300
   \]

2. For the sales over $1000, which is $1500 ($2500 - $1000), the commission is 10%:
   \[
   1500 \times 0.10 = 150
   \]

3. Adding both parts of the commission together gives Antonella's total earnings:
   \[
   300 + 150 = 450
   \]

Therefore, Antonella earned $450.

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, when the water is warm, he swims a mile in:
\[ 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

- Cold water: 
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

- Warm water: 
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes.
2. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

First, we know there are 7 buttons with two holes each:
\[ 7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes per button} = 14 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the remaining buttons are:
\[ 21 \text{ buttons} - 7 \text{ buttons} = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

These 14 buttons each have four holes:
\[ 14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes per button} = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons:
\[ 14 \text{ holes} + 56 \text{ holes} = 70 \text{ holes} \]

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the size of Zack's locker, which is half the size of Timothy's locker.
2. Determine the size of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker.

First, we calculate Zack's locker size:
Zack's locker = 1/2 * Timothy's locker
Zack's locker = 1/2 * 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker = 12 cubic inches

Next, we calculate Peter's locker size:
Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
Peter's locker = 1/4 * 12 cubic inches
Peter's locker = 3 cubic inches

"First, let's determine Susan's weight. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we calculate:

\[ \text{Susan's weight} = \text{Mark's weight} - 20 \]
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate Bob's weight. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan:

\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times \text{Susan's weight} \]
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find the total weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob:

\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we need to convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Finally, we add the pages read in both weeks:
- Total pages in two weeks = \( 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \).

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the problem into parts and sum the amounts received for each set of teeth.

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth. Therefore, for three teeth, the total amount is:
   \[
   3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since the previous amount was $1.00 per tooth, half of that is:
   \[
   0.50 \text{ dollars per tooth}
   \]
   Therefore, for two teeth, the total amount is:
   \[
   2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum all the amounts:
\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

1. **Determine the percentage error:**
   - The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it reaches 468 degrees.
   - The difference is \( 468 - 450 = 18 \) degrees.
   - The percentage error is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Percentage error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
     \]

2. **Apply the percentage error to the desired temperature:**
   - The recipe calls for 520 degrees.
   - If the oven is off by 4%, we need to find the temperature \( T \) that, when increased by 4%, equals 520 degrees.
   - Let \( T \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to.
   - The relationship is:
     \[
     T \times 1.04 = 520
     \]
   - Solving for \( T \):
     \[
     T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
     \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

\[ 100.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = 100.00 \times 0.90 = 90.00 \]

So, the cost for 2 boxes is:
\[ 2 \times 90.00 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of contacts Pete will get from 2 boxes:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, the number of pairs of contacts in 180 contacts is:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \]

Finally, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ 2.00 \]

"To determine how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate the total hours each worked and then the total earnings.

First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked:
- On Saturday, Jill worked 2 hours.
- On Sunday, Jill worked 1 hour.
- Total hours Jill worked = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total hours John worked:
- On Saturday, John worked twice as long as Jill, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours.
- On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
- Total hours John worked = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each:
- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, let's find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

We can express these relationships mathematically as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of more green jelly beans than red jelly beans is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To find the average of the three typing speed measurements, we first need to determine the third measurement. Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM, and it increases to 52 WPM. If he increases his speed by another 5 WPM, his new speed will be:

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations in one month.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. We know that every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, the number of rotations per mile is:
\[ \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

For 400 miles:
\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations in one year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \times 12 \text{ months per year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.**

The maximum number of rotations a tire can undergo is 10,440,000. Therefore, the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. 

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap at this rate. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and see how many classes he can miss while keeping the cost per class below or equal to $10.

1. **Total cost of the classes**: $60
2. **Total number of classes**: 10

If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Total number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

Since $6 is less than $10, Manny's parents will sign him up again if he attends all 10 classes.

Now, let's determine how many classes he can miss while keeping the cost per class below or equal to $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class when he misses \( x \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes and still keep the cost per class at or below $10.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for Clara and Sheila separately and then find the difference.

### Clara's Purchase:
1. Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
2. She had a voucher that gave her $2 off.
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Sheila's Purchase:
1. The price of each pomegranate increased to $30.
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars}
   \]
2. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 0.10 \times 600 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The total cost after the discount:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Difference in Final Prices:
1. The difference between the final prices paid by Sheila and Clara:
   \[

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the sales from green hats in the first month.
2. Calculate the total sales for the first month.
3. Calculate the total sales for the second month.
4. Sum the sales from both months to get the total amount made in two months.

**Step 1: Determine the sales from green hats in the first month.**

Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total sales for the first month.**

The total sales for the first month are the sum of the sales from red hats and green hats:
\[ \text{Total sales for the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total sales for the second month.**

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:
\[ \text{Total sales for the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

**Step 4: Sum the sales from both months to get the total amount made in two months.**

The total amount made in two months is the sum of the sales from the first month and the second month:
\[ \text{Total amount made in two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:
\[ \boxed{2100} \]"

"To determine how much of Sally's wage was withheld, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally received this week.
2. Subtract the amount she should have received (her weekly wage) from the total amount received to find the difference.

First, let's find out how much money Sally received this week:
- Her bank account started with $200.
- Her bank account now holds $420.
- Therefore, the total amount of money she received this week is $420 - $200 = $220.

Next, we know her weekly wage should be $300. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the amount she received from her expected wage:
- $300 (expected wage) - $220 (amount received) = $80.

So, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:
   Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
   \[
   3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves}
   \]

2. Determine the number of whole eggs required:
   Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are needed to make 48 deviled egg halves.
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs}
   \]

3. Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

1. Calculate the total number of days required to read the book:
   \[
   \text{Total days} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
   \]

2. Determine the number of days before the deadline:
   \[
   \text{Days before deadline} = \text{Total days for assignment} - \text{Total days required to read}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Days before deadline} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days}
   \]

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel over 12 months.

1. **Initial cost of the plane:**
   \[
   \text{Initial cost} = \$150,000
   \]

2. **Monthly cost to rent a hanger:**
   \[
   \text{Hanger rent per month} = \$5,000
   \]

3. **Monthly cost for fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Fuel cost per month} = 2 \times \text{Hanger rent per month} = 2 \times \$5,000 = \$10,000
   \]

4. **Total monthly maintenance cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly maintenance cost} = \text{Hanger rent per month} + \text{Fuel cost per month} = \$5,000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of cookies Max has:**
   - Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
   - Katarina has 68 cookies.
   - Therefore, Max has \( 68 + 5 = 73 \) cookies.

2. **Determine the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has:**
   - Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
   - Max has 73 cookies.
   - Therefore, the Cookie Monster has \( 73 - 12 = 61 \) cookies.

3. **Determine the number of cookies Summer has:**
   - Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
   - Max has 73 cookies.
   - Therefore, Summer has \( 73 + 23 = 96 \) cookies.

4. **Calculate the total number of cookies:**
   - Katarina has 68 cookies.
   - Max has 73 cookies.
   - The Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.
   - Summer has 96 cookies.
   - Total cookies = \( 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 \).

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length of the dress before adding the lace trim is \( L + 0.5L = 1.5L \).

She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length of the dress:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris took to mow each half of his lawn in the respective modes and then sum these times.

1. **Turtle Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - Therefore, to mow half the lawn, he would take half of 60 minutes.
   - Time in turtle mode = 60 / 2 = 30 minutes.

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, to mow half the lawn, he would take half of 40 minutes.
   - Time in rabbit mode = 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - Total time to mow the lawn = Time in turtle mode + Time in rabbit mode
   - Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

Thus, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \)
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \)

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost gives us the cost of the four candies:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost for 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost for 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 7.00 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over a period of ten years (120 months).

1. **Calculate Rong's total savings:**
   - Rong saves 20 coins every month.
   - Over 120 months, Rong's total savings are:
     \[
     20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
     \]

2. **Calculate Neil's monthly savings:**
   - Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month.
   - 2/5 times more means Neil saves:
     \[
     20 \text{ coins} + \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins}\right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month}
     \]

3. **Calculate Neil's total savings:**
   - Neil saves 28 coins every month.
   - Over 120 months, Neil's total savings are:
     \[
     28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}
     \]

4. **Calculate the combined total savings:**
   - The total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil is:
     \[
     2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20:
2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40

Let \( T \) be the total bill. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so:
Heartworm check = 0.60 * \( T \)

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\( T = $40 + 0.60T \)

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\( T - 0.60T = $40 \)
0.40T = $40
\( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \)
\( T = $100 \)

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
$125 - $100 = $25

"To find the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1.0 \) dollar.
   - The crate contains 5 bananas.
   - Total cost of bananas: \( 5 \times 1.0 = 5.0 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - The crate contains 12 apples.
   - Total cost of apples: \( 12 \times 0.5 = 6.0 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \( 3 \times 1.0 = 3.0 \) dollars.
   - The crate contains 7 oranges.
   - Total cost of oranges: \( 7 \times 3.0 = 21.0 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost of the crate:**

"To find the total number of squares on Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The problem states there are 14 red squares.
   - Number of red squares = 14

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The problem states there are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The problem states there are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The problem states there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = Number of red squares + Number of blue squares + Number of green squares + Number of white squares
- Total number of squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

"To determine how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $26/adult = $52
- Cost for children: 2 children * $12/child = $24
- Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $76

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $14/adult = $28
- Cost for children: 2 children * $10/child = $20
- Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two parks:
- Savings: $76 - $48 = $28

Therefore, Jake's family will save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of tomatoes from the old vendor.
2. Calculate the daily cost of tomatoes from the new vendor.
3. Determine the daily savings.
4. Calculate the weekly savings.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily cost of tomatoes from the old vendor.**

The old vendor sells tomatoes for $0.5 each, and the vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
\[ \text{Daily cost from old vendor} = 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the daily cost of tomatoes from the new vendor.**

The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.4 each, and the vendor still sells 500 tomatoes a day.
\[ \text{Daily cost from new vendor} = 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day} \]

**Step 3: Determine the daily savings.**

The daily savings is the difference between the daily cost from the old vendor and the daily cost from the new vendor.
\[ \text{Daily savings} = \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the weekly savings.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings is:
\[ \text{Weekly savings} = \$50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$350/\text{week} \]

Thus, the vendor saves \$350 a week.

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the number of weekdays and weekends in two 4-week months:**
   - Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
   - In one 4-week month, there are:
     - Weekdays: \( 4 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ weekdays/week} = 20 \text{ weekdays} \)
     - Weekends: \( 4 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ weekend days/week} = 8 \text{ weekend days} \)
   - In two 4-week months, there are:
     - Weekdays: \( 2 \times 20 \text{ weekdays} = 40 \text{ weekdays} \)
     - Weekends: \( 2 \times 8 \text{ weekend days} = 16 \text{ weekend days} \)

2. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays:**
   - Chairs rented per weekday: 60
   - Total chairs rented on weekdays: \( 60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 40 \text{ weekdays} = 2400 \text{ chairs} \)

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekends:**
   - Chairs rented per weekend day: 100
   - Total chairs rented on weekends: \( 100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 16 \text{ weekend days} = 1600 \text{ chairs} \)

4. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:**
   - Total chairs rented: \( 2400 \text{ chairs} + 1600 \text{ chairs} = 4000 \text{ chairs} \)

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months is:

"To determine the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end, we need to follow the steps of her trades and calculate the outcomes.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading 90% of small stickers for large buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons

3. **Remaining small stickers:**
   - 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers

4. **Trading 50% of large stickers for large buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons

5. **Remaining large stickers:**
   - 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers

6. **Trading the remaining large stickers for small buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons

7. **Total small buttons:**
   - Remaining small stickers: 3
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total small buttons = 3 + 60 = 63 small buttons

8. **Total large buttons:**
   - From trading small stickers: 9
   - From trading large stickers: 20
   - Total large buttons = 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons

9. **Total buttons:**
   - Total small buttons: 63
   - Total large buttons: 29
   - Total buttons = 63 + 29 = 92

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:
\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is also 33. This can be expressed as:
\[ F + A = 33 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS):**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S):**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Number of students needing size small = 2 * 11 = 22.

3. **Medium (M):**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of students needing size medium = 22 - 4 = 18.

4. **Large (L):**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of students needing size large = 18 / 2 = 9.

5. **Extra-large (XL):**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of students needing size extra-large = 9 + 6 = 15.

Now, we sum up all the students needing each size:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which includes both the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

1. **Calculate the driving distance:**
   - They drove for 6 hours in total.
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours, so they drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is \(4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Calculate the hiking distance:**
   - Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half their driving speed is \(50 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 25 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - Their hiking speed is \(25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}\).
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - The total distance is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance.
   - Total distance = \(225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}\).

The total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles.

"To determine the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we need to break down the scoring components and calculate the total score for each player.

1. **Points for enemies jumped on:**
   - Let \( E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
   - Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
   - Points for Emma: \( 10E \)
   - Points for Ava: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)

2. **Points for berries collected:**
   - Let \( B \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
   - Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Points for Emma: \( 5B \)
   - Points for Ava: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)

3. **Points for time left on the timer:**
   - Let \( T \) be the number of seconds Emma has left on the timer.
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left.
   - Points for Emma: \( 30T \)
   - Points for Ava: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)

Now, we can calculate the total scores for both players:

- **Emma's total score:**
  \[
  10E + 5B + 30T
  \]

- **Ava's total score:**
  \[
  10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
  \]

The difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is:
\[
(10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) = -25
\]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is:
\[

2. **Fish Bought from the Store:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the store, which included both orange and white fish.

3. **Final Fish Count:**
   - After adding the 17 new fish, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought from the store.
- \( 17 - x \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought from the store.

4. **Total Fish Count After Purchase:**
   - Total white fish: \( 4 + x \)
   - Total orange fish: \( 3 + (17 - x) = 20 - x \)

5. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.
   - Therefore, \( 20 - x = 2(4 + x) \)

6. **Solve the Equation:**
   \[
   20 - x = 2(4 + x)
   \]
   \[
   20 - x = 8 + 2x
   \]
   \[
   20 - 8 = 2x + x
   \]
   \[
   12 = 3x
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish from the store.

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles currently has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together gives:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, and then determine how many additional students have joined by the end of May.

1. **Initial number of students**: 10
2. **End of January**: The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
3. **End of February**: The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
4. **End of March**: The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
5. **End of April**: The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\)
6. **End of May**: The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\)

Now, we need to find out how many additional students have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the initial 10 students.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in a week. We can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
\]

\[
\text{Total branches} = 420
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7}
\]

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = 60
\]

So, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[
60

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of petals Rose picked initially and then subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped.

1. **Initial Petals:**
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

   Total initial petals: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

2. **Petals Dropped:**
   - 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals
   - 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals
   - 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals
   - 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals

   Total petals dropped: \(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

3. **Remaining Petals:**
   - Total initial petals: \(101\)
   - Total petals dropped: \(22\)

   Remaining petals: \(101 - 22 = 79\)

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent by Jack and his three friends over the 4-hour period.

1. **Determine the play time per quarter for each person:**
   - Jack: 20 minutes per quarter
   - Two friends (worse): 10 minutes per quarter (half of Jack's time)
   - One friend (better): 30 minutes per quarter (1.5 times Jack's time)

2. **Convert the total play time from hours to minutes:**
   - 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

3. **Calculate the number of quarters each person uses:**
   - Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
   - Two friends (worse): 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters each
   - One friend (better): 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

4. **Calculate the total number of quarters used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two friends (worse): 24 quarters each, so 24 * 2 = 48 quarters
   - One friend (better): 8 quarters

   Total quarters = 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters

5. **Calculate the total cost:**

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

We know the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( 2z \) for \( s \):

\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, substitute \( z = 1 \) back to find \( s \):

\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

The amount of oil is \( 2s \):

\[ 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then use that to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) (distance per hour).
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance, the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times v \times 18
     \]
     \[
     D = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the same distance:**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of 4 turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours}

2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly has in her cart:

1. The total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, so each pack of bacon costs:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet of chicken}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for the chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so the total cost for the strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack of apples}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for the apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we need to calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the material needed for small masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Calculate the material needed for large masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

3. **Sum the material needed for both types of masks:**
   - Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks

"Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( D = 60 \)
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \).
3. Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they had the same amount of allowance.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they had the same amount of allowance:
- Total allowance for both = $28
- Allowance for each = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.**

Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was sold for $0.8:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollipop} = \$240 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was bought for $0.5:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollipop} = \$150 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

"First, we determine the amount of water Anthony and his father fill into the tank, which is half the amount of water in the pool. The pool has 10,000 gallons, so half of this is:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and John as \( P \), \( A \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( P + A + J = 100 \) (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years)
2. \( A = J + 10 \) (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. \( P = A + J \) (Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, find \( A \):
\[ A = J + 10 \]
\[ A = 20 + 10 \]
\[ A = 30 \]

Finally, find \( P \):
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]
\[ P = 2(20) + 10 \]
\[ P = 40 + 10 \]
\[ P = 50 \]

So, Peter's age is 50.

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately.

1. Calculate the amount of hay needed for the goats:
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = 75 pounds.

2. Calculate the amount of hay needed for the sheep:
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds.
   - Each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.

3. Calculate the total amount of hay needed:

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
- John earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
  \( 50 \times 6 = 300 \) dollars.

Next, we'll subtract his expenses:
- He spends 50 dollars on gas, so his remaining amount is:
  \( 300 - 50 = 250 \) dollars.
- He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so his remaining amount is:
  \( 250 - 100 = 150 \) dollars.
- He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost for the pencils is:
  \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \) dollars.
- After buying the pencils, his remaining amount is:
  \( 150 - 50 = 100 \) dollars.

Now, we need to determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:
- Each pen costs 25 dollars, so the number of pens he can buy is:
  \( \frac{100}{25} = 4 \) pens.

"To determine the total commission Cayley earns, we need to calculate the commission from each type of newspaper separately and then sum them up.

1. **Commission from New York Times:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy of the New York Times: \( 10\% \times 5 = 0.10 \times 5 = 0.50 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times.
   - Total commission from New York Times: \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

2. **Commission from Wall Street Journal:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal: \( 8\% \times 15 = 0.08 \times 15 = 1.20 \) dollars.
   - Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.
   - Total commission from Wall Street Journal: \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. 

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups.

To find the number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has initially:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Number of measuring spoons} = 24 + 16 = 40 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we subtract these from the total number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils remaining:
\[ \text{Total remaining utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds to the number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Holes dug each day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

2. **Total holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Total holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.
   - At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes.
   - Therefore, by the end of the fourth day, the island had \(4 \times 10 = 40\) holes.

4. **Holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day.
   - The total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is the sum of the holes dug by the end of the third day and the holes dug on the fourth day:
   \[
   29 + x = 40

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokemon:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) into the first equation. First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify this equation:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Distribute the 2:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]
\[
S = 160 - 13
\]
\[
S = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles south.

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles north.
   - Net distance after this leg = 300 miles south - 36 miles north = 264 miles south.

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles south.

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially had:
- She bought 12 boxes.

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes.

Now, we find out how many boxes she has left after giving some away:
- 12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes.

Mrs. Harrington then kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges:
- 1/4 of 8 boxes = 2 boxes.

The number of boxes she sold is the remaining boxes after keeping 1/4:
- 8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
- 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of states in the USA and then use that information to find the number of states in India.

1. The USA has 50 states.
2. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.
3. Half the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).
4. India has 4 more than this, so India has \( 25 + 4 = 29 \) states.
5. To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA and India: \( 50 + 29 = 79 \).

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these together:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

The total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25. Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold each day and then multiply by the respective prices.

First, let's define the number of boxes sold on each day:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
- \( G_S = 10 \) (gingerbread sold on Saturday)
- \( A_S = G_S - 4 \) (apple pie sold on Saturday is 4 fewer than gingerbread sold on Saturday)
- \( G_U = G_S + 5 \) (gingerbread sold on Sunday is 5 more than gingerbread sold on Saturday)
- \( A_U = 15 \) (apple pie sold on Sunday)

Now, we can calculate the number of boxes sold on each day:
- \( A_S = 10 - 4 = 6 \)
- \( G_U = 10 + 5 = 15 \)
- \( A_U = 15 \)

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each day:
- Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \) dollars
- Earnings from apple pie on Saturday: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) dollars
- Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday: \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) dollars
- Earnings from apple pie on Sunday: \( 15 \times 15 = 225 \) dollars

Finally, we sum up the total earnings for both days:
- Total earnings on Saturday: \( 60 + 90 = 150 \) dollars
- Total earnings on Sunday: \( 90 + 225 = 315 \) dollars
- Total earnings for two days: \( 150 + 315 = 465 \) dollars

Thus, Sunny earned a total of:

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use each day:
   - Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She is outside for 4 hours a day.
   - Therefore, she uses \( 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \).

2. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use over the 8 days:
   - She uses 4 ounces of sunscreen each day.
   - She is on vacation for 8 days.
   - Therefore, she will use \( 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \).

3. Determine how many 8-ounce bottles are needed to provide 32 ounces of sunscreen:
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
   - Therefore, she will need \( \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \).

Thus, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

2. **Determine his dad's age when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Therefore, his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.

3. **Determine his dad's current age:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.

4. **Determine his brother's age when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Therefore, his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

5. **Determine his brother's current age:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his brother will be 12 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his brother is currently \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

6. **Calculate the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now:**
   - Dad's current age: 43 years

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Determine the total space each plant, including the space between plants, occupies:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant together occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is the total length of the flower bed divided by the space each plant and the space between it occupy: 
     \[
     \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants}
     \]
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number:
     \[
     44 \text{ plants}
     \]

4. **Determine how many more plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants.
   - The number of additional plants needed is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total number of ""kid-sized"" slices the watermelon is divided into.

Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

There are 4 kids, so the total size of the kids' slices is:
\[ 4x \]

There are 2 adults, so the total size of the adults' slices is:
\[ 2 \times 2x = 4x \]

The total size of all slices combined is:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 ""kid-sized"" slices.

Each adult gets a slice that is \( 2x \), which is equivalent to 2 ""kid-sized"" slices. Therefore, the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost and then the total revenue, assuming the studio is fully covering its costs and making a profit.

1. **Calculate the total cost per session:**
   - Fixed cost per session: $25
   - Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Number of students: 10
   - Total variable cost per session: \( 10 \times 1.50 = 15 \) dollars
   - Total cost per session: \( 25 + 15 = 40 \) dollars

2. **Calculate the total cost per week:**
   - Number of sessions per week: 3
   - Total cost per week: \( 40 \times 3 = 120 \) dollars

3. **Calculate the total cost per month:**
   - Assuming 4 weeks in a month:
   - Total cost per month: \( 120 \times 4 = 480 \) dollars

Since the question asks for the expected earnings, and we are not given any information about the revenue (e.g., how much the studio charges per student per session), we can only calculate the total cost. If the studio is covering its costs, the earnings would be zero. However, if we assume the studio is making a profit, we need more information about the revenue.

Given the information provided, the total cost for the dance studio in a month is:

"To determine how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha, we first need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of their boxes.

1. Calculate the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:
   - Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars.
   - Number of chocolate bars per box for Peter = Total chocolate bars / Number of boxes
   - Number of chocolate bars per box for Peter = 64 / 4 = 16

2. Calculate the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes:
   - Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars.
   - Number of chocolate bars per box for Martha = Total chocolate bars / Number of boxes
   - Number of chocolate bars per box for Martha = 56 / 7 = 8

3. Determine how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha:
   - Difference in the number of chocolate bars per box = Number of chocolate bars per box for Peter - Number of chocolate bars per box for Martha
   - Difference = 16 - 8 = 8

Thus, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 0.07 \times 3x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.79x = 28 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{28}{0.79} \approx 35.44\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 0.09 \times 5y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is 35.44%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.55y = 35.44 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{35.44}{0.55} \approx 64.44\%
     \]

Thus, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 64.44%.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]

First, calculate \( 1 + 0.05 \):

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, raise 1.05 to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day.
2. Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in the month (30 days).

First, let's find out how much ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day:
- A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
- With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
- With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

Next, we calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:
- One dwarf mines 36 pounds per day.
- Forty dwarves will mine \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

Finally, we calculate the total amount of ore mined in 30 days:
- In one day, 40 dwarves mine 1440 pounds.
- In 30 days, they will mine \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, let's determine how many yellow balloons Sally released. She initially had 12 yellow balloons, and she released half of them:

\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons:

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

Now, let's sum up all the balloons Sally carried into the school:

- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons:

\[ 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 \]

So, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give an extension to the whole class.
     - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
     - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60

3. **Personal Extension Scenario:**
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension to the whole class, there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
     - Probability of getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
     - Probability of not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher: 0.50
- Probability of having the normal teacher and getting an extension: 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20
- Probability of having the normal teacher, not getting an extension, but getting a personal extension: 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
1 - 0.76 = 0.24 or 24%

"To determine how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family.
2. Divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates.

First, we find the total number of seats available for friends and family:
- Total seats in the Fine Arts Center: 6000
- Seats for graduates: 950
- Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats for friends and family = Total seats - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
Total seats for friends and family = 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750

Next, we divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates:
- Number of graduates: 950

Tickets per graduate = Total seats for friends and family / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950 = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets.

"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to follow the given relationships step by step.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.

2. **Medium-Sized Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans is:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450
     \]

Thus, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles.

2. **Determine the time to move between bottles:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

3. **Calculate the total time to move between all bottles:**
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = 7 pairs * 5 seconds per pair = 35 seconds.

4. **Add the time to drop the candy in the first bottle:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he needs to drop the candy in the first bottle before moving to the next.
   - Time to drop the candy in the first bottle = 0 seconds (since he starts there).

5. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time to move between bottles + Time to drop candy in the first bottle
   - Total time = 35 seconds + 0 seconds = 35 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds.

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of loans Jim took:**
   - Jim took $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the total income Jim lost by not working:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn:**
   - Total amount = Total loans + Total income lost
   - Total amount = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Determine Jim's new income after college:**
   - Jim's new income is triple his previous income.
   - New income = 3 * $25,000 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year after college:**

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

4. **Verify the total number of slices available:**
   - Each pizza had 8 slices.
   - There were 4 pizzas.
   - Total slices available = \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Since the total slices eaten (31) is less than the total slices available (32), the calculation is correct.

The final numerical answer is:
31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each took, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which took 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To find the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The visit lasts 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The doctor charges $300 per hour.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the visit} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 300 \text{ dollars/hour} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: Hannah gets 30 painkillers, and each pill costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the painkillers} = 30 \text{ pills} \times 4 \text{ dollars/pill} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The mandatory minimum parking time is 2 hours, and the cost is $6 per hour.
   \[
   \text{Cost of parking} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 6 \text{ dollars/hour} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the costs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 200 \text{ dollars} + 150 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 482 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out.
2. Calculate the total cost of mailing the small coupons.
3. Calculate the total cost of mailing the big coupons.
4. Add the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total cost.

Step 1: Calculate the number of big coupons.
Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons:
\[ \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of mailing the small coupons.
Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail:
\[ \text{Cost of small coupons} = 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of mailing the big coupons.
Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail:
\[ \text{Cost of big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Step 4: Add the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total cost.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

"To determine the cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   - Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
   - He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   - Therefore, he needs \( 6 \) pounds of butter.

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   - The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off.""
   - This means for every 2 pounds of butter, the first pound is full price and the second pound is half price.

3. **Calculate the cost for 2 pounds of butter:**
   - The cost of 1 pound of butter is $4.00.
   - The cost of the second pound of butter is \( \frac{4.00}{2} = 2.00 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of butter is \( 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \).

4. **Calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - Since 6 pounds is 3 sets of 2 pounds, we multiply the cost of 2 pounds by 3.
   - The total cost for 6 pounds of butter is \( 6.00 \times 3 = 18.00 \).

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is \(\boxed{18.00}\)."

"To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes John takes in a day.
2. Determine the total number of minutes John spends in class each day.
3. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each week.
4. Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday.
5. Sum the total minutes spent learning each week and convert it to hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of classes John takes in a day.**
John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes.
\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ classes per day} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of minutes John spends in class each day.**
Each class is 40 minutes long.
\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each week.**
John goes to class 5 days a week.
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday.**
John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time each on Saturday and Sunday.
\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]
Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday:
\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes/week} \]

**Step 5: Sum the total minutes spent learning each week and convert it to hours.**
Total minutes spent learning each week:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes/week} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]
Convert minutes to hours:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left.

2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Therefore, the 270 kilograms of meat that the Allosaurus ate is half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means that before the velociraptors ate, there were:
   \[
   270 \times 2 = 540 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. Therefore, the 540 kilograms of meat that was left after the T-Rex ate is half of the total meat on the triceratops. This means that the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was:
   \[
   540 \times 2 = 1080 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

   - Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

Now, we sum the times for all three:
- Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
- Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

"To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to reach his parents' place.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - One-way distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - A round trip means driving to his parents' place and back home.
   - Round trip distance = One-way distance × 2
   - Round trip distance = 140 miles × 2 = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance driven in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total monthly distance = Round trip distance × Number of visits
   - Total monthly distance = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents.

   - 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each.
   - Each worker works for 10 hours.

   \[
   \text{Toys produced by the first 2 workers} = 2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120 \text{ toys}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Toys produced by the next 2 workers} = 2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80 \text{ toys}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total toys produced by the first 4 workers} = 120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of toys needed to complete the order:**
   - The order is for 400 toys.
   - By the end of the shift, 20 toys are still needed.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we first need to calculate the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the remaining half of the stickers to Kris, so Kris received \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.
6. Since Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16
   \]
7. Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 16 \times 4 = 64
   \]

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance.

First, the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T_2 \)-degree water.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixed water is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to determine how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's break this down:

- 3 less than 6 potatoes is:
  \[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
- 1 less than 3 scoops is:
  \[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \), the length of the red rope as \( R \), and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation.

From \( B = Y - 7 \), we can express \( R \) as:
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28 \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

Finally, find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. The mural is half yellow, so 50% of the paint used is yellow.
2. The remaining 50% of the paint is divided equally among red, white, and purple.

First, calculate the total amount of yellow paint used:
- The mural used 12 pints of paint in total.
- Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints.

Next, calculate the total amount of paint used for the other colors (red, white, and purple):
- The remaining paint is \( 12 - 6 = 6 \) pints.
- This 6 pints is divided equally among red, white, and purple.

Since the remaining 6 pints are divided equally among the three colors:
- Each color (red, white, and purple) uses \( \frac{6}{3} = 2 \) pints.

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of teeth the dentist drills.
2. Determine the number of teeth the dentist caps.
3. Calculate the total number of teeth fixed.
4. Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed out of the total number of teeth.

Step 1: The dentist drills 4 teeth.

Step 2: The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:
\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Step 3: The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:
\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Step 4: To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, expand the first equation:
\[
W = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools.

First, we find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that 100 books cost $500. Therefore, the cost per book is:
\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:
\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is distributing the books equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:
\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour and then calculate how long it will take him to reach 60 snowballs.

1. **Determine the net number of snowballs made per hour:**
   - Jay makes 20 snowballs in an hour.
   - In one hour, there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes each.
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so in one hour, \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) snowballs melt.
   - Therefore, the net number of snowballs made in one hour is \( 20 - 8 = 12 \) snowballs.

2. **Calculate the time required to make 60 snowballs:**
   - If Jay makes 12 snowballs per hour, we need to find out how many hours it will take to make 60 snowballs.
   - The time required is \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) hours.

Thus, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, so it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

Therefore, Jim is 24 years old.

"To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to track the usage and orders over the three days and work backwards from the final count of 78 bandages.

1. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - Therefore, the net change in bandages on the third day is \(100 - 25 = 75\) bandages added.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - No new packs were ordered on the second day.

3. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered 1 bulk pack of bandages, which is 50 bandages.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages on the first day as \(x\).

**Calculating the bandages at the end of each day:**

- **End of the first day:**
  \[
  x - 38 + 50 = x + 12
  \]

- **End of the second day:**
  \[
  (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16
  \]

- **End of the third day:**
  \[
  (x - 16) + 75 = x + 59
  \]

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left:
\[
x + 59 = 78
\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = 78 - 59
\]
\[
x = 19
\]

Thus, the nurses' station started with 19 bandages on the first day.

   - The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base.
   - Volume = base area × height
   - Base area = 6 inches × 6 inches = 36 square inches
   - Height = 15 inches
   - Volume = 36 square inches × 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   - The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is 80% of the total volume.
   - Effective volume = 540 cubic inches × 0.80 = 432 cubic inches

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans in the jar:**
   - Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   - Number of jelly beans = effective volume / volume per jelly bean
   - Number of jelly beans = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   - Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   - Number of red jelly beans = 2880 jelly beans × 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Mazie initially has 52 marbles.
2. Mazie gives all 52 marbles to Dallas and Darla.
3. After receiving the marbles from Mazie, Dallas has a total of 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them in the playground.

To find out how many marbles Dallas originally received from Mazie, we need to add the 4 marbles he dropped to the 21 marbles he has left:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

2. **Determine the net number of holes filled each day after Nate returns:**
   - Nate fills 9 holes per day.
   - The dog digs 6 new holes each night.
   - Net holes filled per day = 9 holes filled - 6 holes dug = 3 holes filled per day.

3. **Calculate the number of days it takes to fill all the holes:**
   - Total holes to be filled = 84 holes.
   - Net holes filled per day = 3 holes/day.
   - Number of days to fill all holes = 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

4. **Convert the number of days into weeks:**
   - 1 week = 7 days.
   - Number of weeks = 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

1. Norman High School enrolls 4000 students.
2. Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School.

First, calculate the enrollment at Butler High School:
\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000 \]

Next, find the difference in enrollment between the two schools:
\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many beakers Igor lost. Let's break down the information given:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the 4 tables.

1. Each table has 4 legs.
2. Each leg needs 2 screws.
3. Therefore, each table requires \(4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws}\).

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws in total. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Therefore, the number of screws James will have left over is:

"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

- Alexandra raised $430.
- Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised \(430 + 320 = 750\) dollars.
- Sarah raised $300.
- Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised \(300 + 400 = 700\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all four girls:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. Let's break down the information given:

1. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
2. Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 2 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
4. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.

First, let's find Aaron's speed. Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, his speed is:
\[ \text{Aaron's speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:
\[ \text{Vanessa's speed} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Using her speed:
\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the watermelons.
2. Determine the total selling price with the profit.
3. Calculate the selling price per watermelon.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the watermelons.**
The total cost is given as $80.

**Step 2: Determine the total selling price with the profit.**
The profit is 25% of the total cost. So, we calculate the profit amount:
\[ \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

The total selling price is the total cost plus the profit:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the selling price per watermelon.**
The vendor sold 50 watermelons, so the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - James is currently 18 years old.
   - Therefore, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - John is currently 37 years old.
   - Therefore, John's youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour = \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \).

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour = \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \).

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Difference = Number of oranges Ana can peel - Number of oranges Jane can peel
   - Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know the following:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.
