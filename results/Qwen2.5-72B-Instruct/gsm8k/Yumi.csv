"To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to calculate the increased value of the house after the repairs and then subtract the total cost (purchase price plus repair costs) from this new value.

First, we calculate the increased value of the house. The repairs increased the value by 150% of the original purchase price. So, the increase in value is:

$80,000 * 150% = $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000

The new value of the house is the original purchase price plus the increase in value:

$80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Now, we calculate the total cost of the house, which is the purchase price plus the cost of repairs:

$80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:

$200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

So, the profit Josh made is:

$70,000"
"James runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. To find the total meters he runs a week, we can multiply the number of sprints per session by the distance of each sprint and then multiply that by the number of sessions per week.

So, the calculation is:

3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint * 3 sessions/week

Now, let's do the math:

3 * 60 * 3 = 540 meters

James runs a total of 540 meters a week.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the day and then subtract the amount already given in the morning and afternoon meals.

Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Wendi has already given:
15 cups in the morning + 25 cups in the afternoon = 40 cups

The remaining amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
60 cups (total daily requirement) - 40 cups (already given) = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To calculate the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: every first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

We can pair the glasses into sets of two, with each set costing $5 (for the first glass) + $3 (for the second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find the number of pairs, which is 8 pairs.

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair to find the total cost:
8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, to find the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we add the number of sheep in each city:

Seattle's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Toulouse's sheep = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, including the time lost due to the Windows update.

1. First, we calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file:
   40% of 200 GB is 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB.

2. Since Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is:
   80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

3. After the download is interrupted, Carla has to wait for the Windows update, which takes 20 minutes.

4. After the update, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. The time to download the full 200 GB file is:
   200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

5. The total time is the sum of the time to download 40% of the file, the time for the update, and the time to download the full file again:
   40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 160 minutes.

"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels away from home. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance John travels back home during the 4 hours. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during that time. For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:

Distance in standstill traffic = 0 miles (since he's not moving)
Distance at 30 mph = 30 mph * 0.5 hours
Distance at 30 mph = 15 miles

For the remaining time, which is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph:

Distance at 80 mph = 80 mph * 1.5 hours
Distance at 80 mph = 120 miles

Now, let's add up the distances he traveled back home:

Total distance back home = Distance in standstill traffic + Distance at 30 mph + Distance at 80 mph
Total distance back home = 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles
Total distance back home = 135 miles

Finally, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home to find out how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours:

Distance from home = Initial distance - Total distance back home
Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles
Distance from home = 45 miles

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours she worked.

1. Calculate the regular pay for the first 40 hours:
   Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour

2. Calculate the number of overtime hours:
   Overtime hours = Total hours worked - Regular hours
   Overtime hours = 45 hours - 40 hours

3. Calculate the overtime pay rate:
   Overtime pay rate = Regular hourly rate * 1.2

4. Calculate the overtime pay:
   Overtime pay = Overtime hours * Overtime pay rate

5. Calculate the total earnings:
   Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay

Now, let's do the math:

Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
Overtime hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
Overtime pay rate = $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour
Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, which is:
3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month's downloads. The reduction in downloads is:
30% of 180 = 0.30 * 180 = 54 downloads.

So, the number of downloads in the third month is:
180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is the sum of the downloads from each month:
60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366 downloads.

"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

For the donuts:
3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen would be 3 * $68 = $204

For the mini cupcakes:
2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen would be 2 * $80 = $160

For the mini cheesecakes:
6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen would be 6 * $55 = $330

Now, we add up the costs of all the pastries:
$204 (donuts) + $160 (mini cupcakes) + $330 (mini cheesecakes) = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then see how many years it will take to cover the initial planting cost.

The annual income from selling lemons is:
7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

The annual cost for watering and feeding the tree is:
$3

The net profit per year is:
$10.5 (income) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

The initial cost to plant the tree is:
$90

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
$90 / $7.5 per year = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Melanie started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
3. After the green house, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.
6. After the orange house, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left, which we know is 5.

So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now we solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]
\[ 2x = 36 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance:

20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

Now, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students remaining.

Next, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:

25% of 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Now, we have 16 - 4 = 12 students remaining, and these students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we calculate:

(12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%

"To determine which purchase plan will yield the higher profit, we need to calculate the profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
- Initial cost: $5,000
- Market increase: 2.5%
- Profit from jewelry = $5,000 * 2.5% = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125

For the electronic gadgets:
- Initial cost: $8,000
- Market increase: 1.2%
- Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,000 * 1.2% = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96

The merchant should choose the option that yields the higher profit. In this case, the jewelry yields a higher profit of $125.

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her weekly earnings from both jobs and then multiply by the number of weeks she works in a year.

First, we calculate her weekly earnings from teaching:
$20 per hour * 35 hours per week = $700 per week

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings from cheerleading coaching:
$30 per hour * 15 hours per week = $450 per week

Now, we add the two weekly earnings to find her total weekly income:
$700 per week + $450 per week = $1150 per week

Finally, we multiply her total weekly income by the number of weeks she works in a year to find her annual salary:
$1150 per week * 50 weeks per year = $57,500 per year

Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa should take to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
2. Determine the time Marissa has already spent hiking.
3. Calculate the remaining time she has to complete the trail.
4. Determine the remaining distance she has to hike.
5. Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance.

Step 1: Total time to complete the trail at 4 miles per hour:
Total distance / Average speed = 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours

Step 2: Time already spent hiking:
1 hour for the first 4 miles + 1 hour for the next 2 miles = 2 hours

Step 3: Remaining time to complete the trail:
Total time - Time already spent = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

Step 4: Remaining distance to hike:
Total distance - Distance already hiked = 12 miles - (4 miles + 2 miles) = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

Step 5: Required speed for the remaining distance:
Remaining distance / Remaining time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 mph

Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters of the mixed drink, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink before the spill:

The orange drink is 10 liters and two-thirds of it is water.
Water in orange drink = 10 liters * (2/3) = 20/3 liters = 6.666... liters

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract the water content of that 1 liter from the total water content. The spilled 1 liter of orange drink would also be two-thirds water:
Water in spilled orange drink = 1 liter * (2/3) = 2/3 liters

Water in the remaining orange drink after spill = 6.666... liters - 2/3 liters = 6.666... liters - 0.666... liters = 6 liters

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:

The pineapple drink is 15 liters and three-fifths of it is water.
Water in pineapple drink = 15 liters * (3/5) = 45/5 liters = 9 liters

Now, we add the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to get the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:

Total water = Water in remaining orange drink + Water in pineapple drink
Total water = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixed drink is 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age to find out how many years ago his son was born.

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old and Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha. So, Raymond's current age is:

31 (Samantha's age) + 6 (years older than Samantha) = 37 years old.

Raymond had his son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age:

37 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (age when his son was born) = 14 years ago.

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information that Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount. If the original price is \( P \), then the price Kyle paid is \( P - 0.25P \) or \( 0.75P \).

We know that \( 0.75P = 19.50 \). To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now we calculate the value of \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought and subtract that from the total amount she paid. Then we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza.

The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
$12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:
$50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that one pair of heels costs $33.
2. The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.
3. Together, the two pairs of heels cost $33 + $66 = $99.
4. The problem states that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots.
5. Therefore, the cost of the boots is $99 + $5 = $104.

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162, so we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. The total number of coins is 110:
   \( S + G = 110 \)

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
   \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):

\( S + (S + 30) = 110 \)
\( 2S + 30 = 110 \)
\( 2S = 110 - 30 \)
\( 2S = 80 \)
\( S = 40 \)

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

\( G = S + 30 \)
\( G = 40 + 30 \)
\( G = 70 \)

Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels and then add 5 to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
   Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20
   Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:
   Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add that to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.

So in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points from the first 20 minutes to the points from the second 20 minutes:

4 points + 5 points = 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts eaten in 30 days.

Step 1: Number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 30 days

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week, with 3 hours on the first day and half as much (1.5 hours) on each of the other two days.

First, let's calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate his average speed:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds, and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours given the time spent running and walking.

1. We know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run. Therefore, her running speed is twice her skipping speed:
   Running speed = 3 mph * 2 = 6 mph

2. Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. Therefore, her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed:
   Walking speed = 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph

3. In six hours, Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking:
   Time spent running = 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours
   Time spent walking = 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours

4. Now we can calculate the distance traveled while running and walking:
   Distance running = Running speed * Time spent running = 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles
   Distance walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking = 1.5 mph * 4 hours = 6 miles

5. The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances running and walking:
   Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Determine how many calories are left in your daily calorie target.
3. Calculate how many calories you can consume from the chips.
4. Convert the number of calories you can consume from the chips into grams.

Step 1: Total calories in the 300g bag
Since there are 5 servings in the bag and each serving has 250 calories, the total number of calories in the bag is:
5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories

Step 2: Calories left in your daily target
You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories, so the remaining calories you can consume are:
2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Step 3: Calories you can consume from the chips
Since you have 200 calories left, you can consume up to 200 calories from the chips.

Step 4: Convert calories to grams
To find out how many grams of chips 200 calories represent, we need to know how many calories are in one gram of chips. Since 300g of chips have 1250 calories, we can calculate the calories per gram as follows:
1250 calories / 300g = 4.1667 calories/gram

Now, we can find out how many grams of chips 200 calories represent:
200 calories / 4.1667 calories/gram ≈ 48 grams

So, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making the candles and the total revenue from selling them, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, we determine how many pounds of beeswax are needed to make 20 candles. Since 1 pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, we need 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks for 2 pounds:
2 pounds * $10.00/pound = $20.00

Then, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00

Finally, we find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
$40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write one article.

1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) articles. Let's calculate that:
   \( 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is:
   \( 2 * 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\( 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \) articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent is:
\( 26 * 4 = 104 \) hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes and then bought a package with an unknown number of Post-it notes, which we'll call \( x \). She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left over. The total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is the sum of the Post-it notes she started with and the ones she bought. After using 220, she had 23 left, so the equation is:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 23 + 220 - 80 \]
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the package that Candice purchased contained 163 Post-it notes.

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can calculate the number of red ties as follows:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + (50% of Cost per blue tie)
Cost per red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on all ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Total number of units in the building
Total units = Number of floors * Units per floor
Total units = 15 floors * 8 units/floor
Total units = 120 units

Step 2: Number of occupied units
Occupied units = Total units * Occupancy rate
Occupied units = 120 units * 3/4
Occupied units = 90 units

Step 3: Number of unoccupied units
Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 units - 90 units
Unoccupied units = 30 units

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily income from selling the eggs.
3. Multiply the daily income by the number of days in a week to get the weekly income.

Step 1: Number of dozens of eggs produced per day
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozens per day

Step 2: Daily income from selling the eggs
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.
21 dozens * $2 per dozen = $42 per day

Step 3: Weekly income
There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily income by 7 to find the weekly income.
$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week

Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM and then calculate the time it takes for him to travel back at a different speed.

First, we calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour, the distance is:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back 30 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books Uriah is removing:

30 comic books * 1/4 pound per comic book = 7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah still needs to remove an additional weight to reach the total of 15 pounds. So we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Next, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to account for the remaining 7.5 pounds. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:

7.5 pounds / 1/2 pound per toy = 15 toys

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for both Thursday and Friday, and then find the difference between the two.

For Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each, so the revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires at $40 each, so the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
- The total revenue for Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

For Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each, so the revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
- There are no truck tires repaired, so the revenue from truck tires is $0.
- The total revenue for Friday is $480 + $0 = $480.

Now, we find the difference between the two days:
- The difference in revenue is $520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40.

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck. Then, we divide that remaining weight by the weight of each box.

The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. The weight of each box is 15 pounds.

First, we calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge:

5000 pounds (bridge limit) - 3755 pounds (driver and truck) = 1245 pounds (remaining capacity)

Next, we determine how many boxes can be loaded:

1245 pounds (remaining capacity) / 15 pounds (per box) = 83 boxes

Since we can't load a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is 83.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena pays the full amount of $140 per month. So, the total for the first half is:
6 months * $140/month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), Aleena pays 10% less. The reduced monthly charge is:
$140 - ($140 * 10%) = $140 - $14 = $126

So, the total for the second half is:
6 months * $126/month = $756

Now, we add the totals for both halves of the year to get the annual total:
$840 (first half) + $756 (second half) = $1596

The total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency and then use that to determine the total distance she can travel on a full tank.

First, we calculate the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) based on the information that she traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas:

Fuel efficiency (mpg) = Distance traveled (miles) / Amount of gas used (gallons)
Fuel efficiency (mpg) = 100 miles / 4 gallons
Fuel efficiency (mpg) = 25 mpg

Now that we know her car's fuel efficiency is 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate the total distance she can travel on a full tank of 12 gallons:

Total distance (miles) = Fuel efficiency (mpg) * Tank capacity (gallons)
Total distance (miles) = 25 mpg * 12 gallons
Total distance (miles) = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-leveled sandcastle, we need to determine the square footage of each level and then calculate the average.

Given that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16, we can work our way down to find the square footage of the other levels.

4th level: 16 square feet
3rd level: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
2nd level: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
1st level: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels to find the average:

Total square footage = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet
Number of levels = 4

Average square footage per level = Total square footage / Number of levels
Average square footage per level = 240 / 4 = 60 square feet

"Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, so each girl got:

24 liters * (1/6) = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of:

4 liters * 2 = 8 liters

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:

8 liters + 6 liters = 14 liters

The total amount of water was 24 liters, so the amount of water left is:

24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters

"Charlie started with 10 stickers, then added 21 from the store and 23 from his birthday, which gives:

10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers

Then he gave away 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 to decorate a greeting card, which means he gave away a total of:

9 + 28 = 37 stickers

Subtracting the stickers he gave away from the total he had, we get:

54 - 37 = 17 stickers

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

"To find the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we first need to determine Alex's weight.

Grace's weight is 125 pounds. Alex's weight is 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds:

4 * 125 - 2 = 500 - 2 = 498 pounds

Now, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight to get their combined weight:

125 + 498 = 623 pounds

The combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds.

"Let's denote the number of games won as W and the number of games lost as L. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

W + L = 22

It is also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us:

W = L + 8

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for L:

(L + 8) + L = 22
2L + 8 = 22
2L = 22 - 8
2L = 14
L = 14 / 2
L = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost (L), we can find the number of games won (W):

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

The team won 15 games.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to apply the 10% increase to her initial monthly salary of $600 for each of the three years following her 5-year mark.

First, let's calculate her monthly salary after the first 10% increase:
$600 + ($600 * 10%) = $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we apply the 10% increase for the second year:
$660 + ($660 * 10%) = $660 + $66 = $726

And for the third year:
$726 + ($726 * 10%) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Now, to find her annual salary, we multiply her final monthly salary by 12 (months in a year):
$798.60 * 12 = $9,583.20

Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $9,583.20.

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, which we can denote as \( 10H \).

The total number of copies sold by both is the sum of the copies sold by Harald and Marilyn, which is given as 88,000. So we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find the number of copies Harald sold, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To find out how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of guests that will actually show up by accounting for the 1/4 that don't show up.
2. Determine the number of gift bags needed based on the number of guests that will show up.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.

Step 1: Number of guests that will show up
Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, 3/4 of the attendees will show up. So, we calculate 3/4 of 16 friends:
\( \frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12 \) friends will show up.

Step 2: Number of gift bags needed
Christina needs .75 gift bags per invited guest, but we need to base this on the number of guests that will actually show up. So, we calculate:
\( 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \) gift bags are needed.

Step 3: Total cost of the gift bags
Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:
\( 9 \times 2 = 18 \) dollars.

Christina will spend 18 dollars on gift bags.

"To calculate the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to consider the amount that both the adult and child dinosaurs will eat.

An adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad.
A child dinosaur will eat half as much as an adult, which is 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

There are 20 adults, so they will eat a total of 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs of potato salad.
There are 5 children, so they will eat a total of 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs of potato salad.

Adding the amounts for adults and children together, we get:
200 lbs (for adults) + 25 lbs (for children) = 225 lbs of potato salad.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, to find the total number of pets the three have, we add up the number of pets each one has:

Cindy's pets + Marcia's pets + Jan's pets = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28

So, the total number of pets the three have is 28.

1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
3. James is 10 years old.
4. James is 1 year younger than Corey.

From point 4, we can determine Corey's age:
James (10 years) + 1 year = Corey's age
Corey is 11 years old.

From point 2, we can determine Amy's age:
Corey (11 years) - 2 years = Amy's age
Amy is 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles and then calculate his improved time after his diet change.

1. Let's denote Gerald's original time as \( G \) seconds.
2. Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's original time, so Lee's time is \( G - 2 \) seconds.
3. We are given that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation \( G - 2 = 38 \).
4. Solving for \( G \), we get \( G = 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds. This is Gerald's original time.
5. Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means his new time is 90% of his original time.
6. To find the new time, we calculate \( 0.90 \times 40 \) seconds.

Now, let's do the calculation:

\( 0.90 \times 40 = 36 \) seconds.

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that the number of dogs is 60.
2. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is 2 times the number of dogs, which is 2 * 60 = 120 cats.
3. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12 to find the number of rabbits.

Let's calculate the number of rabbits:

Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Now, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

(2/5) * 200 = 80 boys

2. Calculate the number of girls:
Since there are 200 students in total and 80 of them are boys, the number of girls is:
200 - 80 = 120 girls

3. Calculate the number of girls in the girl scout:
2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so:
(2/3) * 120 = 80 girls in the girl scout

4. Calculate the number of girls not in the girl scout:
The number of girls not in the girl scout is the total number of girls minus the number of girls in the girl scout:
120 - 80 = 40 girls not in the girl scout

"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. James slept 2/3 of the time Harry did, so we multiply Harry's hours of sleep by 2/3:

James's sleep = Harry's sleep * 2/3
James's sleep = 9 hours * 2/3
James's sleep = 6 hours

Now we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept to find the difference:

Difference = Harry's sleep - James's sleep
Difference = 9 hours - 6 hours
Difference = 3 hours

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to work backwards from the final volume of the sauce to the initial volume of the canned tomatoes.

1. Freda ends up with 32 ounces of sauce.
2. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked into sauce, the original volume of the canned tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce.
3. Therefore, the original volume of the canned tomatoes is 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.
4. Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, so the number of cans used is 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
5. Each can contains three tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
- 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
- 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam.

We need to find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. This total, plus the 5 cars that took an exit, should equal the original number of cars (30).

So we have the equation:

\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which is 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we add up all the doorbell presses:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box by subtracting the thickness of the walls from each dimension. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The inner dimensions will be:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now we can calculate the inner volume of one box:

Inner volume of one box = Length * Width * Height
Inner volume of one box = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches
Inner volume of one box = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume:

Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box * Number of boxes
Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches * 3
Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached shore, we need to calculate the total distance she rowed and then determine the amount of water that entered the boat based on the given rate.

First, we need to find out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. We can set up a proportion to find out how many feet she rows in 64 seconds:

20 feet / 16 seconds = x feet / 64 seconds

Solving for x gives us:

x = (20 feet * 64 seconds) / 16 seconds
x = 1280 feet / 16
x = 80 feet

Now that we know she rowed 80 feet, we can calculate the amount of water that entered the boat. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. So, for 80 feet, the amount of water is:

(2 liters / 10 feet) * 80 feet = 16 liters

Therefore, by the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to determine the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new increased price.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each: 10 * $10 = $100
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: 5 * $16 = $80

Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Next, we calculate the selling price of each type of board after the 50% price increase:

- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: $10 + ($10 * 50%) = $10 + $5 = $15 each
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: $16 + ($16 * 50%) = $16 + $8 = $24 each

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards:

- Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 * $15 = $150
- Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 * $24 = $120

Total revenue = $150 + $120 = $270

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Add both salaries to get the total salary the two were receiving four years later.

Step 1: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. If Adrien's salary was $40,000, we can set up the equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + 0.30 * Lylah's salary
$40,000 = 1.30 * Lylah's salary

Now, we solve for Lylah's salary:

Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.30
Lylah's salary = $30,769.23 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what he was making four years ago. So we calculate:

Adrien's salary four years later = Adrien's salary four years ago + 40% of Adrien's salary four years ago
Adrien's salary four years later = $40,000 + 0.40 * $40,000
Adrien's salary four years later = $40,000 + $16,000
Adrien's salary four years later = $56,000

Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. We calculate:

Lylah's salary four years later = Lylah's salary four years ago + 40% of Lylah's salary four years ago
Lylah's salary four years later = $30,769.23 + 0.40 * $30,769.23
Lylah's salary four years later = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69
Lylah's salary four years later = $43,076.92 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 4: Add both salaries to get the total salary the two were receiving four years later.
Total salary = Adrien's salary four years later + Lylah's salary four years later
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,076.92
Total salary = $99,076.92

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92.

"Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for the first 3 hours, which means she covers:

10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

After the first 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. Since she runs for a total of 7 hours, she will run at the slower pace for:

7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours

At 5 miles per hour for 4 hours, she covers:

5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

Adding the distances together, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. Julia had a total of 12 spoons when setting the table.

We need to find out how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

The total number of spoons Julia had before setting the table is the sum of the spoons she bought and the spoons her husband bought, minus the spoons she used to sample the stew:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent on patients per day.
2. Calculate the total cost to the hospital for the doctors.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the patients.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to get the profit.

Step 1: Total time spent on patients per day
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
- There are 500 patients a day.
- Total time spent = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

Step 2: Convert the total time to hours
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Total time in hours = 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

Step 3: Total cost to the hospital for the doctors
- Doctors charge $150 an hour.
- Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

Step 4: Total revenue from the patients
- The hospital charges $200 an hour.
- Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

Step 5: Calculate the profit

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate how many questions he was able to complete in the time given for each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions for each test.

For the first test:
- Mark completed 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, he completed 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions.

The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is:
75 questions - 40 questions = 35 questions.

For the second test:
- Mark completed 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, he completed 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions.

The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is:
100 questions - 30 questions = 70 questions.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
35 questions + 70 questions = 105 questions.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know that there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. We can subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total to find the number of semi-automatic cars.

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Now that we know there are 4 semi-automatic cars, we can calculate the percentage of the total cars that are semi-automatic.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:

- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many babies as queens: \( B = 2Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the worker bees, baby bees, and queens:

\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting the relationships into the total, we get:

\[ 2B + B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 3B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

To solve for \( B \), we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[ 6B + B = 1400 \]

\[ 7B = 1400 \]

Dividing both sides by 7:

\[ B = 200 \]

Now that we have the number of baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees:

\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, there are 400 worker bees.

A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 person on a unicycle would have 1 * 1 = 1 tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total amount made is 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
4. After the seagull and pigeons ate, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off 1 fry.
6. There were 5 fries left.

Let's denote the original number of fries as \( F \).

After Dave and the seagull ate, there were \( F - 14 - 7 = F - 21 \) fries left.
After the pigeons ate, there were \( F - 21 - 9 = F - 30 \) fries left.
The raccoon then stole two thirds of the remaining fries, so one third was left, which means \( \frac{1}{3} (F - 30) \) fries were left after the raccoon.
After the ants carried off 1 fry, there were 5 fries left, so before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.

Now we can set up the equation for the fries left after the raccoon:

\[ \frac{1}{3} (F - 30) = 6 \]

To find \( F \), we solve for \( F \):

\[ F - 30 = 6 * 3 \]
\[ F - 30 = 18 \]
\[ F = 18 + 30 \]
\[ F = 48 \]

So, the original number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 48.

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in class each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each 1 hour long. So, for these three days, he spends:
3 days * 3 hours/day = 9 hours

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long. So, for these two days, he spends:
2 days * 2 hours/class * 2 classes/day = 8 hours

Adding the hours from all five days, we get the total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week:
9 hours (MWF) + 8 hours (TTh) = 17 hours/week

Now, to find out how many hours he spends in class over the 16-week semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks:
17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours

So, in one semester, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes.

"To find the total length of all the baked goods in feet, we need to convert the lengths of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet and then add the lengths of all the items together.

There are 12 inches in a foot.

First, we convert the length of the rolls:
- Each roll is 4 inches long, so 300 rolls will be 300 * 4 inches.
- 300 * 4 inches = 1200 inches.
- 1200 inches / 12 inches per foot = 100 feet.

Next, we convert the length of the croissants:
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, so 120 croissants will be 120 * 6 inches.
- 120 * 6 inches = 720 inches.
- 720 inches / 12 inches per foot = 60 feet.

The baguettes are already given in feet:
- Each baguette is 2 feet long, so 60 baguettes will be 60 * 2 feet.
- 60 * 2 feet = 120 feet.

Now, we add the lengths of all the baked goods together:
- Rolls: 100 feet

- The football field is 100 yards long.
- Running back and forth once is 200 yards (100 yards there and 100 yards back).
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is 15 * 200 yards.

Now, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the full length of the field, which is 200 yards.
- Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards there and 80 yards back, totaling 160 yards.
- She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is 200 yards (for the first run) + 34 * 160 yards.

Let's do the math:

Blake's total distance:
15 * 200 = 3000 yards

Kelly's total distance:
200 + (34 * 160) = 200 + 5440 = 5640 yards

Now, we find the difference between the two distances to see how much farther the winner runs than the loser:

"To find out how many fish Anakin and Locsin caught, we need to calculate the total for each of them and then add those totals together.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Now, let's add up the total number of fish each of them caught:

Anakin's total:
10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19 fish

Locsin's total:
5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13 fish

Combined total:
19 (Anakin's fish) + 13 (Locsin's fish) = 32 fish

So, the total number of fish they were able to catch is 32.

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months with a 20% increase every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is similar to the way the price increases in this scenario. The formula is:

Final Price = Original Price * (1 + Rate of Increase)^(Number of Periods)

In this case:
- The original price is $20.
- The rate of increase is 20%, or 0.20 in decimal form.
- The number of periods is the number of two-month intervals in 36 months, which is 36 / 2 = 18 periods.

Now we can plug these values into the formula:

Final Price = $20 * (1 + 0.20)^18

Let's calculate the final price:

Final Price = $20 * (1.20)^18

Now, we will calculate the value of (1.20)^18 and then multiply it by $20 to get the final price.

Final Price = $20 * 35.2001 (rounded to four decimal places)

Final Price = $704.002 (rounded to three decimal places)

Since we typically round money to the nearest cent, the final price would be:

$704.00

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. The cost of one red car is $4, so the cost of 5 red cars is:
   5 red cars * $4/red car = $20

2. The cost of one action figure is $5, so the cost of 3 action figures is:
   3 action figures * $5/action figure = $15

3. The cost of the doll is the same as 3 action figures, which is:
   3 action figures * $5/action figure = $15

Now, we add up the costs of all the toys:
$20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant with the income she would lose by doing her taxes herself.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work at $35 per hour. The total lost income would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

The difference in cost between doing the taxes herself (in terms of lost income) and hiring the accountant is:

$105 (lost income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit to gather enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans.
2. Divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs Sandra receives per babysitting session.

Step 1: Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, so for 15 flans, Sandra needs:
15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Step 2: Sandra receives 9 eggs for each babysitting session, so the number of sessions required is:
45 eggs / 9 eggs/session = 5 sessions

Sandra has to babysit 5 times.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as S and Brooke's current age as B. According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages at that time will be 28, so we can write the equation:

(S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second one:

(2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by using the first equation:

S = 2B
S = 2 * 8
S = 16

So Seth is currently 16 years old.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants, and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is given as $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
Jacket cost = 3 * Hat cost
Jacket cost = 3 * $25
Jacket cost = $75

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
Pants cost = (Hat cost + Jacket cost) / 2
Pants cost = ($25 + $75) / 2
Pants cost = $100 / 2
Pants cost = $50

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
Total cost = Hat cost + Jacket cost + Pants cost
Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50
Total cost = $150

"To calculate how much Jessica will pay in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to determine the total minimum monthly payment and then calculate 50% more than that amount. After that, we multiply the increased monthly payment by 12 to get the annual amount.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   Student loans: $300
   Credit card: $200
   Mortgage: $500
   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:
   50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500
   Increased monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the annual payment:
   Annual payment = Increased monthly payment * 12 months
   Annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica will pay $18000 in a year.

60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = 90 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cut all the potatoes:
60 potatoes * 5 seconds per potato = 300 seconds

We need to convert the seconds to minutes to add the times together:
300 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes

Now we add the time for peeling and cutting:
90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to first determine how many gallons of lemonade they sold to make a $25 profit.

Let's break down the costs and revenue:
- Cost per gallon for lemons: $3
- Cost per gallon for sugar: $2
- Total cost per gallon: $3 + $2 = $5
- Revenue per glass: $0.50
- Number of glasses per gallon: 20
- Revenue per gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10

Now, let's calculate the profit per gallon:
- Profit per gallon: Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5

To make a $25 profit, they would need to sell:
- Number of gallons to make $25 profit: $25 / $5 per gallon = 5 gallons

Since they need 5 gallons to make a $25 profit, the amount spent on lemons would be:
- Cost of lemons for 5 gallons: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

So, they spent $15 on lemons.

Jan's age two years ago = 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Now, we can find out how old Mark was two years ago:
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2 * Jan's age two years ago) + 5
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2 * 28) + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19 years old.

Now we can find out how old Mark is now:
Mark's current age = Mark's age two years ago + 2
Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

1. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die:
There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6). So the probability is 3 out of 6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 50%.

2. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6). The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3 out of 6, or 1/2. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2. Since these are independent events, we multiply the probabilities: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, we need to find out how much more likely the first event is compared to the second event, expressed as a percentage. We can do this by dividing the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event and then subtracting 1 to find the relative increase, and finally converting that to a percentage.

Relative increase = (Probability of rolling a number greater than 3) / (Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row) - 1
Relative increase = (1/2) / (1/4) - 1
Relative increase = 2 - 1
Relative increase = 1

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Relative increase as a percentage = 1 * 100 = 100%

So, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats, hamsters, and rabbits, and then use the information to determine the number of rats.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and rabbits:

- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total for the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces of straw.
- There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw.

Now, let's add the straw given to the hamsters and rabbits:

\(50 + 20 = 70\) pieces of straw.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed in total, we can find out how many pieces of straw were given to the rats by subtracting the straw given to the hamsters and rabbits from the total:

\(160 - 70 = 90\) pieces of straw for the rats.

We know that each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total number of pieces of straw for the rats by the number of pieces each rat gets:

\(90 \div 6 = 15\) rats in total.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can find the number of rats in each cage by dividing the total number of rats by the number of cages:

\(15 \div 3 = 5\) rats in each cage.

2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, to find the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has, we add the initial number of cards to the cards collected in each of the three months:

20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

"Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers, Mark makes in a week:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To calculate how much money John made that year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increased salary due to the 5% raise.

First, let's calculate the total amount of the raise for the year. John's weekly salary is $2000, and he gets a 5% raise, so the raise per week is:

$2000 * 5% = $2000 * 0.05 = $100

Since the raise is effective from the first day of the year, he will receive the increased salary for all 52 weeks of the year. Therefore, the total raise for the year is:

$100 * 52 weeks = $5200

Now, let's calculate his total salary for the year without the raise:

$2000 * 52 weeks = $104,000

Adding the raise to his total salary:

$104,000 + $5200 = $109,200

Finally, we add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to the total:

$109,200 + $5000 = $114,200

So, the total amount of money John made that year is:

$114,200

"To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year by multiplying the number of acres by the tons of grapes produced per acre.
2. Calculate the total barrels of wine produced by multiplying the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels of wine produced per ton of grapes.

Let's do the math:

1. Total tons of grapes per year = 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons
2. Total barrels of wine per year = 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the cheese used for each meal and then sum it all up.

For the sandwiches:
- He ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
- Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
So, for sandwiches, he used 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices.

For the omelets:
- He ate omelets for breakfast 3 days.
- Each omelet used 1 more slice than each sandwich, so 2 slices + 1 slice = 3 slices per omelet.
So, for omelets, he used 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

For the macaroni and cheese:
- He used 8 slices of cheese in the big dish.

Now, we add up all the slices of cheese used:
14 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices.

"To find out how many pens Janet has now, we need to add the number of green and yellow pens she originally had to the total number of blue and red pens she bought.

First, we calculate the total number of blue pens:
6 bags * 9 pens/bag = 54 blue pens

Next, we calculate the total number of red pens:
2 bags * 6 pens/bag = 12 red pens

Now, we add the number of green, yellow, blue, and red pens together:
22 green pens + 10 yellow pens + 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 98 pens

So, Janet has 98 pens now.

"To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score from the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total points Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 over the five highest scores.
3. Calculate the sum of the four highest scores from the first five tests.
4. Determine the score needed on the sixth test to reach the total points required for an average of 93.

First, let's identify the lowest score from the first five tests:
The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the total points needed for an average of 93 over five tests:
Total points needed = 93 * 5 = 465

Now, we calculate the sum of the four highest scores from the first five tests:
Sum of four highest scores = 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Finally, we determine the score needed on the sixth test:
Score needed on sixth test = Total points needed - Sum of four highest scores
Score needed on sixth test = 465 - 367 = 98

Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To calculate the total kilometers Michael rode, we need to break it down into two parts: the first four weeks and the following three weeks.

For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, in one week, he rides 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides 4 * 125 = 500 kilometers.

For the following three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, in one week, he rides 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides 3 * 120 = 360 kilometers.

Adding the two parts together:
- Total kilometers = 500 (first four weeks) + 360 (next three weeks) = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g per chocolate bar = 1000g

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of a candied apple by dividing the weight of a chocolate bar by 2:
40g per chocolate bar / 2 = 20g per candied apple

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, so:
80 candied apples * 20g per candied apple = 1600g

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000g (chocolate bars) + 1600g (candied apples) = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

- On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.
- On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, we add up all the cakes she bought over the three days:

4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since one plate costs $6000, half a dozen (which is 6) plates would cost:

6 plates * $6000/plate = $36000

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this amount. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

$36000 - $1200 = $34800

Since twenty dozen cups are equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost of the cups by the number of cups:

$34800 / 240 cups = $145/cup

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then determine how much more money she needs after accounting for her savings and babysitting earnings.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is:
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so the remaining amount she needs is:
$70 (total cost) - $10 (savings) = $60

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
4 * $5 = $20

Now, we subtract her babysitting earnings from the remaining amount she needs:
$60 (remaining amount) - $20 (babysitting earnings) = $40

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn mowed:
$40 / $4 = 10

Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42, which is the sum of the eggs produced by the red and white chickens:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens:
\[ W = R + 2 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( R \):

\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle and then divide that by his walking speed.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
P = 2 * (length + width)

Given the dimensions of the park:
Length (L) = 6 miles
Width (W) = 1.5 miles

We can calculate the perimeter as follows:
P = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
P = 2 * 7.5
P = 15 miles

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours (T) he spends walking, we use the formula:
T = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values we have:
T = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
T = 5 hours

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. The number of customers on the first day is 100.
2. The number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

Now, we can calculate the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the number of customers from the first two days from the total number of customers over the three days:

500 (total) - 100 (first day) - 150 (second day) = 250 (third day)

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago the pools had 16 gallons more water each (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes).

So, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons. The relationship between the two pools 4 minutes ago is given by:

\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, which gives us the equation:

\[ B = 4S \]

We can now solve these two equations simultaneously.

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:

\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Expand and simplify:

\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]

Subtract \( 2S \) from both sides:

\[ 2S + 16 = 32 \]

Subtract 16 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 16 \]

Divide by 2:

\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she owes and then subtract the total amount she has paid.

First, we calculate the total amount Janeth owes, which is the principal plus the 10% interest:
Total amount owed = Principal + (Principal * Interest Rate)
Total amount owed = $2000 + ($2000 * 0.10)
Total amount owed = $2000 + $200
Total amount owed = $2200

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will have paid after 12 months:
Total amount paid = Monthly Payment * Number of Payments
Total amount paid = $165 * 12
Total amount paid = $1980

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount owed:
Remaining balance = Total amount owed - Total amount paid
Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980
Remaining balance = $220

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220.

Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses to the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A:

30% of 1000 students = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students

Now, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total to find out how many were left:

1000 - 300 = 700 students

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B, which is 3/5 of the remaining 700 students:

3/5 of 700 students = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students

Finally, we subtract the number of students who went out through exits A and B from the total to find out how many went out through exit C:

700 - 420 = 280 students

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that John has 54 candies.
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.
3. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.
4. To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: 54 - 33 = 21.

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

"Mike originally had 5 pen pals but stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is now writing to 3 pen pals. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, Mike receives 3 * 2 * 5 = 30 pages a week. Since he responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week.

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so to write 30 pages, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 180 / 60 = 3 hours writing a week.

"To calculate how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to consider the following:

1. Jason's phone plan includes 1000 minutes per month.
2. He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
3. He has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people this month.
4. The month has 30 days.

First, we calculate the total minutes used for the daily calls with his boss:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Next, we add the extra minutes used for calls to other people:
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan to find out how many minutes Jason has left:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin has 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes 2 * 5 = 10 fries from Griffin. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle took, so Colby takes 5 - 3 = 2 fries from Griffin. Now Griffin has 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.
5. Ginger gives Griffin some fries, and after that, Griffin has 27 fries.

To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to calculate the difference between the number of fries Griffin had after Colby took some and the number of fries Griffin had at the end.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since there are the same number of fish in each aquarium, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

So we can write the equation as:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"First, let's calculate the total cost before the discount:

Cost per hour: $250
Hours per day: 6
Days per week: 4
Weeks: 5

Total cost before discount = Cost per hour * Hours per day * Days per week * Weeks
Total cost before discount = $250 * 6 * 4 * 5

Now, let's calculate the total cost with the 10% discount:

Discount = 10% of Total cost before discount
Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount

Let's do the math:

Total cost before discount = $250 * 6 * 4 * 5 = $30,000
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = $3,000
Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Jean paid $27,000.

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the number of cookies each of them ate and then convert that into calories.

First, let's calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on each day:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:

- Sue's total cookies: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.
- Her sister's total cookies: 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Next, we convert the number of cookies into calories:

- Sue's total calories: 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories.
- Her sister's total calories: 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories.

Finally, we find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:

- Difference in calories: 9200 calories (Sue) - 3600 calories (Sister) = 5600 calories.

"To find out how many boys are in the third class, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students in the school.
2. Determine the total number of girls in the school.
3. Subtract the number of girls in the first and second classes from the total number of girls to find the number of girls in the third class.
4. Since each class has 20 students, subtract the number of girls in the third class from 20 to find the number of boys in the third class.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total number of students in the school:
   3 classes * 20 students/class = 60 students

2. Total number of girls in the school (50% of the total students):
   60 students * 50% = 30 girls

3. Number of girls in the third class:
   30 girls (total) - 15 girls (first class) - 12 girls (second class) = 3 girls (third class)

4. Number of boys in the third class:
   20 students (third class) - 3 girls (third class) = 17 boys

So, the number of boys in the third class is 17.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
2. Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
3. Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, which means he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, we can find out how many wolves Rick killed today. Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and he killed 12 cougars, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves today.

Now we can add up all the animals Rick killed:

- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals

Total animals killed: 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73 animals

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, who went down 30 times.

First, we calculate 30% of Mitchel's 30 slides:
30% of 30 = 0.30 * 30 = 9

Now, we subtract that from Mitchel's total to find Anne's total:
Anne's slides = Mitchel's slides - 30% of Mitchel's slides
Anne's slides = 30 - 9 = 21

Now that we know Anne went down the slide 21 times, we can calculate how many times Robert went down the slide, which is 4 times as much as Anne:
Robert's slides = 4 * Anne's slides
Robert's slides = 4 * 21 = 84

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"First, let's calculate the total number of cows before Mr. Sylas buys the additional 40 cows. There are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so:

10 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 200 cows

Now, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. Since there are 20 stalls, each stall will get:

40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 cows/stall

Now, we add the 2 new cows to the 20 cows that were already in each stall:

20 cows/stall + 2 cows/stall = 22 cows/stall

Since we want to know how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

22 cows/stall * 8 stalls = 176 cows

"To find the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by termites from the total weight to find the remaining weight.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree.
- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- There are 200 / 10 = 20 sections in the tree.
- The total weight of the tree is 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

Step 2: Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
- The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
- The weight of the wood eaten is 30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds.

Step 3: Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by termites from the total weight.
- The remaining weight of the tree is 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

The final weight of the redwood tree is 5600 pounds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
4. Andrea has 52 apples.

From point 1, we can write the equation for the number of apples Jamal has as:
A = J + 8
where A is the number of apples Andrea has and J is the number of apples Jamal has.

Since we know Andrea has 52 apples, we can substitute A with 52:
52 = J + 8
J = 52 - 8
J = 44
So, Jamal has 44 apples.

From point 3, we can write the equation for the number of bananas Jamal has as:
B = J + 4
where B is the number of bananas Jamal has.

Substituting J with 44:
B = 44 + 4
B = 48
So, Jamal has 48 bananas.

From point 2, we can write the equation for the number of bananas Andrea has as:
A_b = B / 2
where A_b is the number of bananas Andrea has.

Substituting B with 48:
A_b = 48 / 2
A_b = 24
So, Andrea has 24 bananas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have:
Total fruits = A + J + A_b + B
Total fruits = 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas)
Total fruits = 52 + 44 + 24 + 48
Total fruits = 168

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla will need, we can first determine how many cups are needed for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the cups needed for 36 cookies as follows:
36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozens
3 dozens * 2 cups of flour per dozen = 6 cups of flour

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We can calculate the cups needed for 30 cookies similarly:
30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozens
2.5 dozens * 2 cups of flour per dozen = 5 cups of flour

Now, we add the cups of flour needed for both days:
6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups of flour

Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then subtract her budget from this total cost.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Now, we add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to get the total cost:
Total cost = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total cost = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000
Total cost = $409,500

Finally, we subtract Mrs. Cruz's budget from the total cost to find out how much more the house costs:

"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up from 300 degrees to 400 degrees. It takes 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes it took to heat up to 300 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is 0.40 * 20 = 8 minutes.

So, the time to heat up from 300 to 400 degrees is 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes.

Now, let's add the initial 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees to the 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees:

20 minutes + 28 minutes = 48 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the cooking time, which is 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil to 400 degrees. The warming time was 48 minutes, so the cooking time is:

48 minutes - 5 minutes = 43 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 years to each of their current ages and then sum those future ages.

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as K. According to the information given:

M + K = 20

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be K + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

(M + 10) + (K + 10) = M + K + 20

Since we know that M + K = 20, we can substitute this into the equation:

20 + 20 = 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

40"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ R = 6S \]

In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now we can substitute the value of \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the equation, we get:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

The cost of the popsicles is:
20 popsicles * $0.25 per popsicle = $5.00

The cost of the ice cream bars is:
4 ice cream bars * $0.50 per ice cream bar = $2.00

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost:
$5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

So, Peter paid a total of $7.00.

"To find half the number of spots all the snakes have combined, we first need to determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

Let the number of spots on a mamba be \( x \).
Then the number of spots on a cobra is \( 2x \).

We know that a cobra has 70 spots, so:
\( 2x = 70 \)
\( x = 70 / 2 \)
\( x = 35 \)

So, a mamba has 35 spots.

Now, we can calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park:

Total spots on cobras = Number of cobras * Spots per cobra
Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70
Total spots on cobras = 2800

Total spots on mambas = Number of mambas * Spots per mamba
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35
Total spots on mambas = 2100

Total spots combined = Total spots on cobras + Total spots on mambas
Total spots combined = 2800 + 2100
Total spots combined = 4900

Half the number of spots they all have combined is:
Half the total spots = Total spots combined / 2
Half the total spots = 4900 / 2
Half the total spots = 2450

"To find out how many dollars Maddy will spend on pizza, we need to calculate the total number of people, the number of pizzas required, and then the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total number of people:
- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
- There are 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:
- 39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost:
- 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

So, Maddy will spend $195 on pizza.

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then determine how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the length available for the sterling silver beads is:
25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (topaz gemstones) = 17 inches

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of sterling silver beads that can fit into the 17 inches is:
17 inches / (1/4 inch/bead) = 17 * 4 beads = 68 beads

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week.

So, in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories
- Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories
- Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories

Now, let's add the stories from both weeks for each of them:
- Alani's total: 20 (first week) + 40 (second week) = 60 stories
- Braylen's total: 40 (first week) + 80 (second week) = 120 stories
- Margot's total: 60 (first week) + 120 (second week) = 180 stories

Finally, we add all their stories together to get the total number of stories written by the family:
60 (Alani) + 120 (Braylen) + 180 (Margot) = 360 stories

5 quarters = 5 * 25 cents = 125 cents
2 dimes = 2 * 10 cents = 20 cents

Total amount = 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

Now, if she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we subtract that from her total:

145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 76-star flag that are not part of the 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. So, the total number of stars in these rows is:

(3 rows * 8 stars/row) + (2 rows * 6 stars/row) = 24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of stars to find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows:

76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

Since each of the 5-star rows contains 5 stars, we divide the remaining number of stars by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows:

40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones. 

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds each. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of one truck:

6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Since you can't have a fraction of a truck, and all flagstones must be transported in one trip, the company will need 3 trucks to transport all 80 flagstones.

"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values for the car in the slow lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. This is 22 (Ali's medals) + 17 (Izzy's medals) = 39 medals.
3. Since the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out, we can find the total number of medals given out by multiplying their total by 10. So, 39 * 10 = 390 medals.

The total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we'll subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total to find out how many are left for the children:

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Finally, we'll divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total time she spends working, excluding her half-hour pause.

The time from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to 180 minutes. If Susan takes a half-hour pause, she is not working for 30 minutes. Therefore, the total working time is:

180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:

150 minutes / 10 minutes per interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each interval, her total earnings are:

15 intervals * $5 per interval = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"Let's break down the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's see who gets an extra point in the fourth round:

- Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has less than 20 points, so he does not get an extra point: 18 points.
- Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the total points for all three players after the fourth round:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members who each consume 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household:
   5 members * 0.2 kg/member = 1 kg/meal

2. Since they eat rice twice a day, calculate the daily consumption:
   1 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 2 kg/day

3. Calculate the weekly consumption:
   2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week

1. Opening bid by Carmen: $200
2. First person bids: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Carmen bids again: $250 + $50 = $300
4. Second person bids: $300 + $50 = $350
5. Carmen bids again: $350 + $50 = $400
6. Third person bids: $400 + $50 = $450

"To calculate the total amount John pays for the driving service in a year, we need to consider both the mileage cost and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- John's work is 30 miles away, so a round trip is 60 miles.
- He goes to work 5 days a week, so in a week, he travels 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.
- Over 50 weeks, he travels 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.
- At a rate of $2 per mile, the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000/year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the monthly bonus:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus for the year is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

Now, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to get the total annual cost:
- Total cost = cost of miles driven + total bonus
- Total cost = $30,000/year + $1,800/year = $31,800/year.

Therefore, John pays $31,800 a year for the driving service.

- Price per book: $20
- Number of unsold books: 50
- Number of books sold in the current (third) year: 45
- Number of books sold in the first year: twice the number sold in the third year

First, let's calculate the number of books sold in the first year:
Number of books sold in the first year = 2 * number of books sold in the third year
Number of books sold in the first year = 2 * 45 = 90

Now, let's calculate the total number of books sold over the three years:
Total books sold = Total number of books - Number of unsold books
Total books sold = 250 - 50 = 200

Next, we can find out how many books were sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books sold in the first and third years from the total number of books sold:
Number of books sold in the second year = Total books sold - (Number of books sold in the first year + Number of books sold in the third year)
Number of books sold in the second year = 200 - (90 + 45)
Number of books sold in the second year = 200 - 135
Number of books sold in the second year = 65

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year by multiplying the number of books sold in the second year by the price per book:
Total amount earned in the second year = Number of books sold in the second year * Price per book
Total amount earned in the second year = 65 * 20

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week and then calculate how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, given that she needs 4 weeks to lose what Joey loses in one week.

First, we find out how much weight Joey loses in one week:
Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in one week, Joey loses:
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in one week). To lose 8 pounds, which is the total amount Joey loses in 4 weeks, we need to calculate how many weeks it will take Sandy:
8 pounds / 2 pounds per 4 weeks = 4 * 4 weeks = 16 weeks

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular pool can be found using the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length \( l = 6 \) feet
- Width \( w = 4 \) feet
- Depth \( d = 5 \) feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]
\[ V = 24 \times 5 \]
\[ V = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, if it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, the total cost \( C \) can be calculated by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 \]
\[ C = 12 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12.

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls and nongendered children based on the number of boys, and then add all the numbers together.

Given:
- The classroom has 30 boys.
- There are 3 times as many girls as boys.
- There are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys.

Let's calculate the number of girls:
Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

Now, let's calculate the number of nongendered children:
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 of 40 people left the party. That's 40 / 4 = 10 people who left.

If 22 men stayed at the party, that means 25 (initial number of men) - 22 (men who stayed) = 3 men left the party.

Since 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men, the remaining 10 - 3 = 7 people who left must have been women.

Initially, there were 15 women, so the number of women left at the party is 15 (initial number of women) - 7 (women who left) = 8 women.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has a total of 26 pencils, 2 of which are loose, so the pencils in the boxes total 26 - 2 = 24 pencils. Since these 24 pencils are evenly distributed among 3 boxes, each box contains 24 / 3 = 8 pencils.

Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all of Jam and Meg's pencils. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils, so together they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold to find out how many boxes are needed: 72 / 8 = 9 boxes.

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To find out how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total amount of liquid added to the coffee, which includes both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, we determine how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes:

65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters per ice cube = 60 milliliters weaker

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. So, the total amount by which the coffee is weakened is:

60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of junior programmers.
2. Calculate the number of senior programmers.
3. Calculate the monthly salary of a senior programmer.
4. Calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers.
5. Calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers.
6. Add the total monthly salaries of junior and senior programmers to get the total amount paid to all programmers.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. Since the company has 100 employees, the number of junior programmers is:
   \( \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \)

2. The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers:
   \( \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \)

3. The monthly salary of a senior programmer is $400 more than a junior programmer, who is paid $2000 per month:
   \( \text{Monthly salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \)

4. The total monthly salary for all junior programmers is:
   \( \text{Total for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \)

5. The total monthly salary for all senior programmers is:
   \( \text{Total for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \)

6. The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:
   \( \text{Total amount paid to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \)

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got in, so the number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

We know that after the second stop, there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = 20 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 5 - 7 + 8 = 20 \]
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

4. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops.
5. After buying more, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
6. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
7. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

Therefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to determine the remaining percentage of charge needed:

100% - 60% = 40%

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find out how many minutes it will take to charge 40 percentage-points, we multiply the number of percentage-points by the time it takes to charge one percentage-point:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

Now, to convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%.

- Annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- Net income after state tax: $30,000 - (20% of $30,000) = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- Net income after state tax: $36,000 - (10% of $36,000) = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net incomes of both jobs to find out how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay.

**Difference in net pay:**
- Job B net pay - Job A net pay = $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows Farmer Brown has, and then calculate the total number of legs.

Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( Ch \).

According to the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of animals is 60, so \( C + Ch = 60 \).
2. There are twice as many chickens as cows, so \( Ch = 2C \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( C \):
\( C + 2C = 60 \)
\( 3C = 60 \)
\( C = 20 \)

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\( Ch = 2C \)
\( Ch = 2 \times 20 \)
\( Ch = 40 \)

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:
\( (20 \text{ cows} \times 4 \text{ legs/cow}) + (40 \text{ chickens} \times 2 \text{ legs/chicken}) \)

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first determine the total time he spent on vacation. We know that the time he spent watching shows (3 shows * 2 hours each) and the time he spent boating and swimming is 30% of his total vacation time.

Let's calculate the time spent on these activities:
- Time spent boating: 6 hours
- Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
- Time spent watching shows: 3 * 2 = 6 hours

Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:

Now we solve for T:
T = 15 hours / 0.30
T = 50 hours

Now that we know the total vacation time, we can find out how much time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of his total vacation time:

"Marisa gets $5 every day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. The total cost of the lollipops per day is:

4 lollipops * $0.25 per lollipop = $1.00

So, the amount she saves each day is:

$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount saved is:

$4.00 * 5 days = $20.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Billy starts with $10.
2. He buys candy at $1.5 per pound.
3. After buying the candy, he has some change left.
4. He spends half of his change on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each.
5. He bought 40 gumballs.

First, we need to find out how much money Billy spent on the gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40, we can calculate the total cost of the gumballs:

40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.00

Since this $2.00 is half of his change, his total change must have been:

$2.00 * 2 = $4.00

Now we know that after buying the candy, Billy had $4.00 left. This means he spent:

$10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00 on candy.

To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount he spent on candy by the cost per pound:

$6.00 / $1.5/pound = 4 pounds

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can write this as an equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 2x = 45 + 5 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities, then multiply that by the number of trips it makes in a day to find the daily distance. After that, we can determine how many days it can operate before reaching the 18,000-mile service interval.

1. Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:
   The combined distance from the first to the second and then to the third city is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.
   The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than 175 miles, which is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

2. Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:
   The total distance for one trip is the sum of the distances between all three cities: 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

3. Calculate the daily distance:
   The train makes this trip 3 times a day, so the daily distance is 300 miles * 3 = 900 miles.

4. Calculate the number of days before service is needed:
   The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so we divide 18,000 miles by the daily distance to find the number of days: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

The train goes 20 days between services.

"To find out how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to determine the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. Since a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed, we can calculate it as follows:

Average stuffing for a collie bed = (Stuffing for a Rottweiler bed + Stuffing for a chihuahua bed) / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 pounds + 2 pounds) / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = 10 pounds / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = 5 pounds

Now we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:

Total stuffing for chihuahua beds = 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed
Total stuffing for chihuahua beds = 8 pounds

Total stuffing for collie beds = 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed
Total stuffing for collie beds = 15 pounds

Total stuffing needed = Total stuffing for chihuahua beds + Total stuffing for collie beds
Total stuffing needed = 8 pounds + 15 pounds
Total stuffing needed = 23 pounds

"To calculate the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time for each leg of the journey and then add them together.

1. For the trip to his friend's house:
   - The original distance is 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles, making the total distance 210 miles.
   - He drives at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

2. For the trip back home:
   - The distance is 240 miles.
   - He drives at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Now, we add the time for both trips to get the total time:
Total time = Time to friend's house + Time back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of boys who were absent on Friday from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

96 (total students) - 43 (girls) = 53 boys

On Friday, 4 boys were absent. So, the number of boys present at school on Friday is:

53 (total boys) - 4 (absent boys) = 49 boys

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks be \( x \).
2. According to the problem, \( x = 3 \) (since 3 customers were kicked out for this reason).
3. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4x - 5 \).
4. The number of people kicked out for physical violence is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters, which is \( 3(4x - 5) \).
5. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons, which is \( 50 \).

Let's denote the number of people kicked out for other reasons as \( y \).

The equation for the total number of people kicked out is:

\[ x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) + y = 50 \]

Now we can substitute \( x = 3 \) into the equation:

\[ 3 + (4 \cdot 3 - 5) + 3(4 \cdot 3 - 5) + y = 50 \]

Let's calculate the values:

\[ 3 + (12 - 5) + 3(12 - 5) + y = 50 \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 3 \cdot 7 + y = 50 \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 + y = 50 \]
\[ 31 + y = 50 \]

Now, we solve for \( y \):

\[ y = 50 - 31 \]
\[ y = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is \( 19 \).

"To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote Erin's initial points as E.

According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Sara has 8 points, so three times Sara's points is 3 * 8 = 24 points.

Therefore, after scoring 14 points, Erin has E + 14 points, and this is equal to 24 points.

We can set up the equation:
E + 14 = 24

Now, we solve for E:
E = 24 - 14
E = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to consider the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords for the officers.

1. **Picture frames cost**: 44 seniors * $20/frame = $880
2. **Etching cost**: 20% of $20/frame = $4/frame, so for 44 seniors, it's 44 * $4 = $176
3. **Pins cost**: 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10
4. **Cords cost**: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, so 44 / 4 = 11 officers, and 11 * $12/cord = $132

Now, we add all the costs together:

$880 (frames) + $176 (etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1198.

"To find out how much Ethan saved by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate 20% of the market price of the wallpaper.

20% of $400 is calculated as follows:
20% * $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

This means Ethan saved $80 by making the wallpaper himself. To find the total cost for Ethan, we subtract the savings from the original market price:

$400 - $80 = $320

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper was $320.

"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:
14 pairs * 2 = 28 pairs

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
28 pairs / 2 = 14 pairs

However, six people returned their pairs, so the number of pairs sold on Sunday is:
14 pairs - 6 pairs = 8 pairs

The total number of pairs sold by the end of the sale is the sum of the pairs sold on each day:
14 pairs (Friday) + 28 pairs (Saturday) + 8 pairs (Sunday) = 50 pairs

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of tennis shoes sold is:
50 pairs * 2 shoes/pair = 100 shoes

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples she picked each day and then sum them up.

First, we know that Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday for $56. Since she sells apples at $4 each, we can calculate the number of apples she sold on Monday by dividing the total money by the price per apple:

Number of apples sold on Monday = Total money / Price per apple
Number of apples sold on Monday = $56 / $4
Number of apples sold on Monday = 14

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, so:

Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples picked on Tuesday
Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * 12
Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 24

Now, we can sum up the apples picked over the three days:

Total apples picked = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday
Total apples picked = 14 + 12 + 24
Total apples picked = 50

"To calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to first determine the total amount she will owe after the five months, including the interest. The formula to calculate the simple interest is:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- Principal is the amount borrowed, which is $3,650.
- Rate is the annual interest rate, which is 10% or 0.10.
- Time is the duration for which the money is borrowed, which is 5 months or \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

Let's calculate the interest first:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 152.50 \]

Now, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount to be repaid:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50 \]

Since Karan has to pay this amount back in equal monthly installments over 5 months, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.50 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.50 per month.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first. He sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. According to the problem, the amount of land he has left is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write:

\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we can solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

Number of girls who can't make it = 50% of 26 = 0.5 * 26 = 13 girls

So, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

Number of girls who can make it = 26 - 13 = 13 girls

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers

The total number of popsicles is the sum of the popsicles that Betty and Sam have, which is given as 165. So we can write the equation:

5x + 6x = 165

Combining like terms, we get:

11x = 165

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 165 / 11
x = 15

Now that we have the value of x, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:

Betty has 5x popsicles, which is 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6x popsicles, which is 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"To calculate the savings, we need to determine the total cost of the streaming services and then subtract that from the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10 a month, but with a 20% discount for bundling.

The discount on Hulu and Disney Plus is 20% of $20 (since each is $10 and he has both), which is $4. So, the bundled cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix to the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:

$10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

The total cost of the cable package is $60 a month. So, the savings by cancelling the cable package and switching to streaming services is:

$60 (cable) - $26 (streaming services) = $34.

- The total number of slices taken is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices taken from the original number of slices to find out how many are left:

- The number of slices left is 12 - 9 = 3 slices.

"To find out how many days Mark needs to save to buy the bike, we can set up the following equation:

Initial amount + (Daily earnings * Number of days) = Cost of the bike

Let's denote the number of days as \( d \).

\( 50 + 10d = 300 \)

Now, we solve for \( d \):

\( 10d = 300 - 50 \)

\( 10d = 250 \)

\( d = \frac{250}{10} \)

\( d = 25 \)

So, Mark has to save his money for 25 days.

"To find the total number of bugs Nancy counted, we need to calculate the number of each type of bug and then sum them up.

1. Number of spiders: 90
2. Number of millipedes: 1/3rd of the number of spiders, which is 1/3 * 90 = 30
3. Number of stink bugs: twice the number of millipedes minus 12, which is 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Now, we add up all the bugs:
90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

"To calculate the builder's earnings for a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a week.
2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.
3. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.
4. Multiply the number of days worked in a year by the daily pay rate.

Step 1: The builder works 6 days every week.
Step 2: The builder works 4 weeks every month, so the number of days worked in a month is 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 24 days/month.
Step 3: There are 12 months in a year, so the number of days worked in a year is 24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year.
Step 4: The builder gets paid $50 every day, so the annual earnings are 288 days/year * $50/day.

Now, let's calculate the final amount:

288 * 50 = 14400

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies and then determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk he needs to buy, given the sizes of the packages.

First, we calculate the total amount of flour and milk needed for the quadruple batch:

- Flour: 3 cups per batch * 4 batches = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup per batch * 4 batches = 4 cups

Next, we determine how many 2-cup bags of flour and 2-cup bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:

- Flour: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags
- Milk: 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

Finally, we calculate how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:

- More bags of flour: 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4

"To find out how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner before the reduction.
2. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner after the reduction.
3. Find the difference in daily energy usage to determine the daily savings.
4. Multiply the daily savings by 30 to find the total savings over 30 days.

Step 1: Daily energy usage before reduction
The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. For 8 hours, the usage is:
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts

Step 2: Daily energy usage after reduction
If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for 3 hours a day:
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts

Step 3: Daily savings
The difference in energy usage is the amount saved each day:
7200 watts - 2700 watts = 4500 watts

Step 4: Total savings over 30 days
To convert watts to kilowatts, we divide by 1000:
4500 watts / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatts

Now, we multiply the daily savings in kilowatts by 30 days:
4.5 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatts

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days.

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to add up the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

First, we calculate the total number of stripes:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: 2 * 17 = 34 stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: 36 stripes
- One zebra with half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: 36 / 2 = 18 stripes

Now, we add up all the stripes:
34 (from the two zebras) + 36 (from the one zebra) + 18 (from the last zebra) = 88 stripes

Next, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras to find the average:
88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

"To find out how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required and then multiply by their respective costs.

First, we determine how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people served per sandwich:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now we calculate the cost for the meat and cheese:

5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese together to get the total cost:

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

So, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. Since there is twice as much corn as cannolis and he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns is:

2 * 40 = 80 corns

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

40 + 60 = 100 cannolis

Now, Allan has 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the new number of corns is:

100 - 40 = 60 corns

Finally, to find the combined total of corns and cannolis, we add the new totals together:

100 cannolis + 60 corns = 160

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before his jog, he had completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. This means that before the jog, he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps completed or in progress.

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the number of steps he had before his jog from the number of steps he had after his jog (or in progress):

8,000 (steps after jog) - 6,000 (steps before jog) = 2,000 steps.

Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we'll determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate:

9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Now, we'll calculate the total time Toby needs to get to the airport, including the time to read the book and the travel time:

30 minutes (reading) + 10 minutes (travel) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, we can now calculate how many minutes early he will be:

60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Add the total payments for May and June to get the final amount.

Step 1: Total payment for May
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hours per week: 40
- Pay rate: $15 per hour
- Weeks in May: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

Total payment for May = Number of employees * Hours per week * Pay rate * Weeks in May
Total payment for May = 40 * 40 * $15 * 4

Step 2: Number of employees in June
- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees continued working.
- Number of employees in June = 3/4 * Number of employees in May
- Number of employees in June = 3/4 * 40

Step 3: Total payment for June
- We will use the same hours per week and pay rate for June.
- Weeks in June: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

Total payment for June = Number of employees in June * Hours per week * Pay rate * Weeks in June
Total payment for June = (3/4 * 40) * 40 * $15 * 4

Step 4: Total payment for May and June
Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June

Now, let's calculate the numbers:

Total payment for May = 40 * 40 * $15 * 4 = 40 * 40 * 60 = 96,000

Number of employees in June = 3/4 * 40 = 30

Total payment for June = 30 * 40 * $15 * 4 = 30 * 40 * 60 = 72,000

Total payment for May and June = 96,000 + 72,000 = 168,000

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy:
- The first pound of taffy costs $3.
- The second pound is 1/2 off, so it costs $3 * 1/2 = $1.50.
- The total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, the cost of the mixed bag of seashells is $1.50.

Then, the cost of the 4 magnets:
- Each magnet costs $0.25, so 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all her purchases:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00
- Total: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Finally, we subtract the total cost of her purchases from the $10 she started with:
- $10 - $7.00 = $3.00

Sally has $3.00 left.

"To find out how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and then add the cost of the finale firework.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:
- The first package costs $400.
- The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages before the discount is:
$400 + $800 = $1200.

Now, let's apply the 20% discount to the two packages:
- A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the total cost.
- The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.
- The cost after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:
$960 + $150 = $1110.

So, the total amount Tim spent is:
$1110.

"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. For 30 days, she will need:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen madeleine cookies, and 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. 

First, we need to find out how many candles are expected to explode. Since Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, 1% of them are expected to explode. 

1% of 50,000 candles is:
0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles

Next, we need to find out how many of these exploding candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles have this defect.

5% of 500 exploding candles is:
0.05 * 500 = 25 candles

So, 25 of Marcy's candles are expected to both explode and smell like wet dog.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount and then apply it to the regular price of the blouses.

The regular price for each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount. To find the discount amount for one blouse, we calculate 30% of $20:

Discount amount per blouse = 30% of $20
                           = 0.30 * $20
                           = $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to find the discounted price for one blouse:

Discounted price per blouse = Regular price - Discount amount
                            = $20 - $6
                            = $14

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we multiply the discounted price of one blouse by 4 to find the total cost:

Total cost of the discounted blouses = Discounted price per blouse * Number of blouses
                                    = $14 * 4
                                    = $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, let's call this number \( x \).
4. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
5. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
6. Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.
7. The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500.

We can set up the equation to represent the total number of apples gathered:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

Let \( c \) represent the number of camels and \( d \) represent the number of dromedaries.

From the information given, we have two equations:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180:
   \( c + d = 180 \)

2. The total number of humps is 304, with camels having 2 humps and dromedaries having 1 hump:
   \( 2c + d = 304 \)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( c \) and \( d \).

First, we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( d \):

\( (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \)
\( 2c + d - c - d = 124 \)
\( c = 124 \)

Now that we know there are 124 camels, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

\( 124 + d = 180 \)
\( d = 180 - 124 \)
\( d = 56 \)

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

Next 1 day: 0 kilometers (he wasn't traveling)
Second week (7 days): 300 kilometers/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers

Now, we add up all the distances:
800 kilometers (first 4 days) + 240 kilometers (next 2 days) + 0 kilometers (next 1 day) + 2100 kilometers (second week) = 3140 kilometers

So, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we can start by determining the size of Zack's locker since we know the size of Peter's locker and the relationship between Zack's and Peter's lockers.

Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. So, to find the size of Zack's locker, we multiply Peter's locker size by 4:

Zack's locker size = Peter's locker size * 4
Zack's locker size = 5 cubic inches * 4
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, and it is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

Timothy's locker size = Zack's locker size * 2
Timothy's locker size = 20 cubic inches * 2
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

Now, we know that Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb at 6,000 feet, Oliver must climb:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The tattered jeans cost $28.
2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22.
3. Cole saved a total of $6.
4. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is 1/3 * $6 = $2.
5. The rest of the savings, which is 2/3 of the total savings, came from the tattered jeans, so that's 2/3 * $6 = $4.

Now, to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to add the savings to the sale prices of the jeans to get their original prices.

6. The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 (sale price) + $4 (savings) = $32.
7. The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 (sale price) + $2 (savings) = $24.

Finally, to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we subtract the original price of the tattered jeans from the original price of the jogger jeans.

8. $24 (original price of jogger jeans) - $32 (original price of tattered jeans) = -$8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, which implies a positive difference. Since we have a negative number, it means the tattered jeans originally cost more than the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans actually cost $8 less than the tattered jeans, not more. Therefore, the answer to the question as stated is 0, because the jogger jeans do not cost more than the tattered jeans.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then calculate the total number of cards, including the ones he kept.

First, we need to find out how much money Kenny made from selling the cards. Since the amusement park ticket costs $100 and he has $50 in spending cash, he must have made $150 in total from selling the cards.

Now, we can calculate how many cards he sold by dividing the total amount of money he made by the price per card:

$150 / $1.5 per card = 100 cards

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, the 100 cards he sold represent the remaining 2/3 of his collection. To find the total number of cards he started with, we can set up the following equation:

2/3 * total cards = 100 cards

To find the total number of cards, we can solve for the total cards:

total cards = 100 cards / (2/3)
total cards = 100 cards * (3/2)
total cards = 150 cards

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
2. The caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. This means 18 guests (half of 36) could have two hotdogs, and the other 18 guests would have one hotdog each.
3. The total number of hotdogs prepared is therefore 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest + 18 guests * 1 hotdog/guest = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.
4. However, 40 guests showed up, and all of them wanted a second hotdog. This means 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs would be needed.
5. Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.
6. Since each guest who didn't get a second hotdog is missing one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of hotdogs short, which is 26.

The total cost before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

The discount is 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

The final price after the discount is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

So, Charlotte's order was $132.00.

"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then subtract the amount of money she already has.

The cost of the skipping rope is $6.
The cost of the board game is $11.
The cost of the playground ball is $2.

The total cost of the items is:
$6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Dora has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16, so the total amount of money she has is:
$2 + $16 = $18

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost of the items:
$19 - $18 = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many gallons of gas are in one container.
2. Calculate how many gallons 1/4 of a container is.
3. Convert the gallons to pints, knowing that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints.

Step 1: Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5 to find out how many gallons are in one container.
15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Step 2: Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we calculate 1/4 of 3 gallons.
3 gallons * 1/4 = 0.75 gallons

Step 3: Convert 0.75 gallons to pints.
0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he had 1% of $5 left, or $0.05.
2. This means he actually spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95 on chips and candy bars.
3. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, so he spent 3 * $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.
4. The remaining amount he spent on candy bars is $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.
5. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is $3.75 / $0.75.

Now, let's calculate the number of candy bars:

$3.75 / $0.75 = 5

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide that by the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the cost of the onions:
- Antoine doubles the amount of onions, so he uses 2 * 2 = 4 pounds.
- The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so 4 pounds will cost 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock:
- He needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00, so the total cost for beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of onions + cost of beef stock = $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Finally, we divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving:
- The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater and then determine how much earlier she needs to leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

1. Wayne's drive time to the theater is 4 minutes.
2. Bernadette's drive time is four times Wayne's, so it is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
3. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to account for her longer drive time plus the 5-minute difference.

Wayne's total time to the theater is 4 minutes. Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, so she needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne's arrival time.

However, since it takes her 16 minutes to drive, she needs to leave 16 minutes before her arrival time. To find out how much earlier she needs to leave compared to Wayne, we add the 9 minutes (to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne) to her 16-minute drive time:

16 (drive time) + 5 (time before Wayne's arrival) = 21 minutes.

Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = Length × Width

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet because the area is given in square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so:

Length in feet = 3 yards × 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now we can solve for the width:

360 square feet = 9 feet × Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)

Substituting the values we have:

Perimeter = 2 × (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 × 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought and then find the difference.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 beads, so we can calculate the total number of beads for each sister as follows:

Elizabeth's total beads:
(1 pack of red + 2 packs of clear) * 20 beads/pack
(1 + 2) * 20
3 * 20
60 beads

Margareth's total beads:
(3 packs of blue + 4 packs of red) * 20 beads/pack
(3 + 4) * 20
7 * 20
140 beads

Now, we find the difference between the number of beads each sister has:

140 beads (Margareth) - 60 beads (Elizabeth) = 80 beads

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"Marcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees. After baking for 3 hours, with the temperature increasing by 5 degrees each hour, the temperature increase is:

3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

So the new temperature after baking is:

40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. The total cooling is:

30 minutes / 10 minutes * 2 degrees = 3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

So the final temperature after the window is opened is:

55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon.
   - Swim: 40 minutes
   - Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
   - Run: 50 minutes
   - Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

2. Now, let's calculate the time it took James to complete the swim.
   - James is 10% faster than Jon in the swim, so he takes 90% of Jon's swim time.
   - James's swim time: 40 minutes * 90% = 40 minutes * 0.9 = 36 minutes

3. Next, we calculate the time it took James to complete the bike ride.
   - James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike.
   - James's bike time: 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

4. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
   - James's total time: 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

5. Now we can calculate the time it took James to complete the run.
   - We subtract the swim and bike times from James's total time to find the run time.
   - James's run time: 180 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 59 minutes

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to follow the information given step by step.

First, we need to convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, we can calculate the length of Movie C in minutes as follows:

Movie C length = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour

Now, we can calculate the length of Movie B, which is 5 minutes longer than Movie C:

Movie B length = Movie C length + 5 minutes

Finally, we can find the length of Movie A, which is one-fourth the length of Movie B:

Movie A length = Movie B length / 4

Let's do the calculations:

Movie C length = 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes
Movie B length = 75 + 5 = 80 minutes
Movie A length = 80 / 4 = 20 minutes

For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails of hay

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which means he has:
6 * $5 = $30

After buying the hay, the change Michael will have is:

5. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to get the profit.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Cost per sneaker:
   Total cost / Number of sneakers = $576 / 48 = $12 per sneaker

2. Revenue from the flash sale:
   Number of sneakers sold at flash sale * Price per sneaker = 17 * $20 = $340

3. Number of sneakers sold to the department store:
   Total number of sneakers - Number of sneakers sold at flash sale = 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers

4. Revenue from the department store:
   Number of sneakers sold to the department store * Price per sneaker = 31 * $25 = $775

5. Total revenue:
   Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from department store = $340 + $775 = $1115

"Let's break down the costs and savings to find the regular price of the popcorn.

If you buy the super ticket, the total cost is $20 for the movie and one popcorn with a soda for $1 extra, making it $21 in total.

If you buy the movie ticket for $12 and the soda for $3, and you save $2 by not buying the super ticket, then the cost of the movie ticket, soda, and popcorn should be $2 less than the super ticket cost.

So, the cost of the movie ticket, soda, and popcorn is $21 - $2 = $19.

We already know the movie ticket is $12 and the soda is $3, so the cost of the popcorn is:

$19 (total) - $12 (movie ticket) - $3 (soda) = $4

The regular price of the popcorn is $4."
"First, let's find the original cost of filling one helium balloon. If 20 balloons cost $900, then the cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

So, the original cost per balloon was $45.

After the price increase, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + \text{Increase} = 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, if Bentley fills 170 balloons at the new price, the total cost would be:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = \text{New cost per balloon} \times \text{Number of balloons} = 65 \times 170 \]

Let's calculate that:

\[ 65 \times 170 = 11050 \]

So, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.

"To find out how much the potting soil will cost Bob, we need to calculate the total volume of soil required and then determine the cost based on the volume and price per bag.

First, we calculate the volume of one raised bed:
Volume of one bed = width * length * height
Volume of one bed = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet
Volume of one bed = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total volume = volume of one bed * number of beds
Total volume = 32 cubic feet * 10
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = total volume / volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag
Number of bags = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total cost = number of bags * cost per bag
Total cost = 160 bags * $12 per bag
Total cost = $1920

The potting soil will cost Bob $1920.

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12
Total number of puppies = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's spotted puppies + Brandon's spotted puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4
Total number of puppies with spots = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100

Now we calculate the percentage:

Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 35

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then divide the total weight by the truck's capacity.

1. Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
2. Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
3. Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
4. Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300
Total weight = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, so we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find out how many trips are needed:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
Number of trips = 2

Since the number of trips is a whole number, the farmer will need exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many plants Toni has.
2. Use the number of plants Toni has to find out how many plants Shondra has.

First, we know that Frederick has 10 plants. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find out how many plants Toni has, we calculate 60% of Frederick's plants and add that to Frederick's total:

60% of 10 plants = 0.60 * 10 = 6 plants

So, Toni has 10 plants + 6 plants = 16 plants.

Now, Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So we subtract 7 from the number of plants Toni has:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 plants - 7 plants = 9 plants

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for both Becky and Kelly, taking into account the discounts they received, and then find the difference between the two amounts.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents or $9.00.
- Becky received a $1 discount, so the final cost for Becky is $9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents or $10.00.
- Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is 10% of $10.00, which is $1.00.
- The final cost for Kelly is $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, we find the difference between what Kelly paid and what Becky paid:
- Kelly paid $9.00 and Becky paid $8.00.
- The difference is $9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00.

So, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky.

"To find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cupcakes that can be decorated with all the sprinkles.
2. Determine how many pans are needed to bake that many cupcakes.

Step 1: Total number of cupcakes that can be decorated
Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes.
So, the total number of cupcakes that can be decorated is:
6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Step 2: Number of pans needed
Each pan holds 12 cupcakes, so to find out how many pans are needed to bake 48 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pan:
48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year.
2. Determine how many pencils were used after two months.
3. Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months.
4. Determine how many pencils were left at the end of the year.

Let's go through each step:

1. Total number of pencils at the start of the year:
   There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils.
   Total pencils = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

2. Pencils used after two months:
   1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 pencils = 60 pencils

3. Pencils remaining after two months:
   Pencils remaining = Total pencils - Pencils used
   Pencils remaining = 300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils

4. Pencils left at the end of the year:
   1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 pencils = 80 pencils

So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt has to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we can set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Now, to isolate \( c \), we multiply both sides by 2:

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have five cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the shark's length to inches because the remoras' lengths are given in inches.
2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
3. Divide the combined length of the remoras by the shark's length in inches.
4. Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The shark is 10 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the shark's length in inches is:
   10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

2. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length is:
   2 remoras * 6 inches/remora = 12 inches

3. The combined length of the remoras as a fraction of the shark's length is:
   12 inches / 120 inches = 0.1

4. To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   0.1 * 100 = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To find out how long Jason has to spend walking each day to break in his new shoes, we need to calculate the total number of days he has available to walk and then divide the total minutes required by the number of walking days.

First, let's determine the total number of days Jason has to break in the shoes. Since there are 7 days in a week and he can walk 4 days a week, we can calculate the total number of walking days in three weeks as follows:

3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days

Now, we know that it takes 240 minutes to break in the shoes. We can divide this total by the number of walking days to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day:

240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day

So, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day to break in his new shoes.

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:
9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15

However, this sum counts the kids who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts twice, so we need to subtract the number of kids who are allergic to both:
15 - 3 (both) = 12

This means that 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class:
32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic to dairy or peanuts) = 20

So, 20 kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything.

"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow paint tubes he has based on the information given about Ben's paint tubes.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, we calculate:
Jasper's blue paint tubes = 4 / 2 = 2 tubes

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, we calculate:
Jasper's yellow paint tubes = 3 * 3 = 9 tubes

Now, we add the number of blue and yellow paint tubes Jasper has to find the total:
Total tubes of paint Jasper has = Jasper's blue paint tubes + Jasper's yellow paint tubes
Total tubes of paint Jasper has = 2 + 9 = 11 tubes

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = 3/4 * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = 3/4 * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny:

Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 grains + 48 grains

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of oats one horse consumes per day:
   - One horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - There are 2 meals per day.
   - So, one horse eats 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

2. Calculate the total amount of oats all four horses consume per day:
   - There are 4 horses.
   - So, 4 horses * 10 pounds/horse/day = 40 pounds/day.

3. Calculate the total amount of oats all four horses consume for five days:
   - 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

4. Determine how many 50-pound bags of oats are needed for 200 pounds:

"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost of the first venue is equal to the total cost of the second venue.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per person for food. So the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per person, which includes food. So the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We want to find the value of \( x \) where these two costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as L, D, and B, respectively.

According to the problem, we have the following equations:

1. L + D + B = 43 (the total number of insects collected)
2. L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. D = B / 2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)

From equation 3, we can express B in terms of D:

B = 2D

Now we can substitute L and B from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

(D + 7) + D + (2D) = 43

Combine like terms:

4D + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

4D = 36

Divide by 4:

D = 9

Now that we know D, we can find L using equation 2:

L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16

"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood and then figure out the best combination within his budget.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks.
  Cost per stick from 2 x 4 = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.
  Cost per stick from 2 x 8 = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood provides a lower cost per stick, it is the cheaper option. However, the question asks for the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber, which in this case is the 2 x 4 piece of wood.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood he can buy with $24:

- Number of 2 x 4 pieces he can buy = $24 / $4 per piece = 6 pieces

Since each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

- Total sticks from 2 x 4 = 6 pieces * 200 sticks per piece = 1200 sticks

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber (2 x 4) is:

"To calculate the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of legs for all dogs.
2. Calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair.

Step 1: Total number of legs
Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs.
Total legs = 4 legs/dog * 6 dogs = 24 legs

Step 2: Number of pairs of snowshoes
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs.
Number of pairs = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs

Step 3: Total cost
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00

Therefore, it will cost Mario $144.00 to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs.

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we first need to determine the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th, and then calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.

1. Calculate the total number of days:
- From January 1st to July 19th (since today is December 31st, we start counting from the next day, January 1st):
- January has 31 days, but we start on the 1st, so we count 31 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year and 29 days in a leap year.
- March has 31 days.
- April has 30 days.
- May has 31 days.
- June has 30 days.
- July has 19 days up to the 19th.

Let's add these up to find the total number of days:

31 (January) + 28 (February, assuming it's not a leap year) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 19 (July) = 200 days

2. Calculate the total number of calories to lose 30 lbs:
- 1 lb = 3500 calories
- 30 lbs = 30 * 3500 calories = 105,000 calories

3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit:
- Total calories to lose / Total number of days = 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal by July 19th.

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah will need to drink, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Hannah will run by multiplying the number of laps by the distance of each lap.
2. Multiply the total distance by the amount of water she needs to drink per kilometer.

Let's do the math:

1. Total distance = Number of laps × Distance per lap
   Total distance = 8 laps × 0.25 km/lap
   Total distance = 2 km

2. Water needed = Total distance × Water per kilometer
   Water needed = 2 km × 60 ml/km
   Water needed = 120 ml

Hannah will need to drink 120 ml of water.

"Julie initially had $500. She spent 20% of it on clothes, which is:

20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

So, after buying clothes, she had:

$500 - $100 = $400

Then she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs, which is:

25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

After buying CDs, she had:

$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write that as:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write that as:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second one:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Now we can solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying the cost of the lot by 3:
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So the house cost $90,000.

"Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, which means she bought a total of 8 * 5 = 40 canvas bags. Each pack cost her $4, so the total cost for the canvas bags was 8 * $4 = $32.

She then sold each of the 40 canvas bags for $8 each, so the total revenue from selling the bags was 40 * $8 = $320.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

$320 (revenue) - $32 (cost) = $288 (profit).

- The number of rows of red tulips is 36 divided by 6, which is 36 / 6 = 6 rows.

For the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- The number of rows of blue tulips is 24 divided by 8, which is 24 / 8 = 3 rows.

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips together:
- Total rows = 6 rows (red) + 3 rows (blue) = 9 rows.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

Next, we need to convert the days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

This is the time it would take one person to paint the whole house. Now, if we have 5 people working together, we can divide the total hours by 5 to find out how long it would take them to paint the house together:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

"Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has, and \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so we can write:

\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]

We are also told that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so:

\[ S_O = 20 \]

Substituting the value of \( S_O \) into the first equation, we get:

\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]

Solving for \( C_O \), we find:

\[ C_O = 20 + 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Now, let's consider Jenna. Let \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has, and \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has. We know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so:

\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so:

\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Now we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:

Total sofas \( S \) = \( S_O + S_J \)
Total chairs \( C \) = \( C_O + C_J \)

\[ S = 20 + 64 \]
\[ C = 22 + 66 \]

\[ S = 84 \]
\[ C = 88 \]

The total number of sofas and chairs is:

\[ S + C = 84 + 88 \]
\[ S + C = 172 \]

Cost of the headphone set: $48 - $4 = $44

Now, to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the amount he spent on the headphone set, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD.

Number of additional CDs: $44 / $4 = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the variations in his routine.

First, we'll calculate the total hours if he had worked out 4 hours every week for 8 weeks:
4 hours/week * 8 weeks = 32 hours

Next, we'll add the extra hours he spent working out on the occasions that were different:
- For the two consecutive weeks where he spent 5 hours each week, he worked out an extra hour each week compared to the usual 4 hours, so that's 2 extra hours in total.
- For the week where he spent 6 hours, he worked out 2 extra hours compared to the usual 4 hours.

So, the total extra hours are:
2 extra hours (from the two 5-hour weeks) + 2 extra hours (from the 6-hour week) = 4 extra hours

Now, we add the extra hours to the initial total:
32 hours (initial total) + 4 hours (extra hours) = 36 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

On the first stop:
- 8 passengers get off, so 48 - 8 = 40 passengers remain.
- 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on, so 5 * 8 = 40 passengers get on.
- After the first stop, the number of passengers is 40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80 passengers.

On the second stop:
- 21 passengers get off, so 80 - 21 = 59 passengers remain.
- 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 1/3 of the number who got off, so 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on.
- After the second stop, the number of passengers is 59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66 passengers.

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 66.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we can start by determining the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost:

$1,100 - $400 = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the two monitors is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total to find the combined cost of the two monitors:

$2,400 - $1,100 - $700 = $600

Since this is the cost for two monitors, we divide by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

$600 / 2 = $300

So, one monitor cost $300.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

April has 30 days, so the first half of the month consists of 15 days, and the second half also consists of 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month as \( x \). According to the problem, he saves twice as much each day in the second half, which would be \( 2x \).

The total savings for the month can be expressed as:
\[ 15x + 15(2x) = 1125 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Since \( x \) is the amount saved each day in the first half, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

So, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month.

5 hamburgers * $4/hamburger = $20

The cost of the potato fries is:
10 packs * $0.30/pack = $3

The cost of the fruit drinks is:
5 cans * $2/can = $10

The total cost of all the items is:
$20 (hamburgers) + $3 (fries) + $10 (drinks) = $33

Now, subtract the total cost from the fifty-dollar bill:
$50 - $33 = $17

So, Carly gets $17 in change.

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

For the first $1000 in sales, the commission is 30%:
$1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300

For the sales over $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, the commission is an additional 10%:
$1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add both parts of the commission to find the total earnings:
$300 (commission for the first $1000) + $150 (additional commission for sales over $1000) = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned a total of $450 in commission.

"Bill started with 2 cases of water, with 24 bottles each, so he has:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

He has 70 guests, and he wants to have 2 bottles of water for each guest, so he needs:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the number he needs:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Ray takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water, and then find the difference between the two times.

First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 1 mile in warm water:
- In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- In warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water.

So, the time to swim 1 mile in warm water is:
2 * 16 minutes (twice as long) + 2 minutes (2 minutes more) = 32 minutes + 2 minutes = 34 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time to swim 3 miles in both conditions:
- In cold water, 3 miles would take 3 * 16 minutes = 48 minutes.
- In warm water, 3 miles would take 3 * 34 minutes = 102 minutes.

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and in cold water:
102 minutes (warm water) - 48 minutes (cold water) = 54 minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day.

"To find the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of both the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub and then add them together.

The cost of the foot-long fish sub is given as $40.

The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is thrice the cost of the foot-long fish sub, which means:
Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * $40 = $120

Now, we add the cost of both subs to find the total cost:
Total cost = Cost of foot-long fish sub + Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub
Total cost = $40 + $120
Total cost = $160

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we need to calculate the holes from the buttons with two holes and the holes from the buttons with four holes, then add them together.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is:
7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes

The rest of the buttons in the bag have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the number of four-hole buttons is:
21 buttons - 7 buttons = 14 buttons

The total number of holes from the four-hole buttons is:
14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes

"To find out how big Peter's locker is, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the size of Zack's locker, which is half the size of Timothy's locker.
2. Determine the size of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker.

Let's start with step 1:

Timothy's locker = 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker = 1/2 * Timothy's locker
Zack's locker = 1/2 * 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker = 12 cubic inches

Now, let's move to step 2:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
Peter's locker = 1/4 * 12 cubic inches
Peter's locker = 3 cubic inches

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

"The pet shop had 3 cages with 10 hamsters each and 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each. To find the total number of rodents, we can calculate the total number of hamsters and the total number of guinea pigs and then add them together.

Total number of hamsters = 3 cages * 10 hamsters/cage = 30 hamsters
Total number of guinea pigs = 3 cages * 5 guinea pigs/cage = 15 guinea pigs

Total number of rodents = Total number of hamsters + Total number of guinea pigs
Total number of rodents = 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs
Total number of rodents = 45

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine the weight of each person.

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.

Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so:
Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so:
Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 * 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, to find the average weight, we add the weights of all three friends and divide by the number of friends:

Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3
Average weight = (150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds) / 3
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the angle the sun will make with the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, starting from the tip of the pyramid.

The sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid. After 10 hours, the sun will have moved:

5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, we need to add the 50 degrees to this angle to find the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours.

32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

So, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be 82 degrees.

"To find out how much James spends on candles, we need to determine the total number of candles he needs and then calculate the cost based on the price per pack.

1. First, we find out the ages of James's two sons:
   - The older son is 12 years old.
   - The younger son is 4 years younger, so he is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

2. Next, we calculate the total number of candles needed:
   - The older son needs 12 candles.
   - The younger son needs 8 candles.
   - In total, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

3. Now, we determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy:
   - Each pack contains 5 candles.
   - To get at least 20 candles, James needs 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

4. Finally, we calculate the total cost:
   - Each pack costs $3.
   - The total cost for 4 packs is 4 * $3 = $12.

James spends $12 on candles.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night. Assuming she read every night of the week, that's 7 nights. So, the total reading time in the first week is:

15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes

Now, we need to convert the reading time into pages. Since she reads 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute:

2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 1.3333 pages/minute

Now, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week:

105 minutes * 1.3333 pages/minute = 140 pages (rounded to the nearest whole number)

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages from both weeks to get the total number of pages read in two weeks:

140 pages (first week) + 100 pages (second week) = 240 pages

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

According to the problem, Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \), and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

The problem also states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so we can write the equation:

\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

\[ 10 = N \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many he buys each day and then sum them up.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spends an equal amount each day on wooden action figures. Since there are 4 days, we divide the total amount of money by 7 (days in a week) to find out how much he spends each day:

$70 / 7 = $10 per day

Since wooden action figures cost $5 each, he can buy:

$10 / $5 = 2 wooden action figures per day

Over 4 days, he will buy:

2 wooden action figures/day * 4 days = 8 wooden action figures

For the remaining 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he will spend the same amount of money each day on plastic action figures. Since he has already spent $10 per day for 4 days, he has:

$70 - ($10 * 4) = $70 - $40 = $30 left

He will spend $10 each day on plastic action figures, and since they cost $2 each, he can buy:

$10 / $2 = 5 plastic action figures per day

Over 3 days, he will buy:

5 plastic action figures/day * 3 days = 15 plastic action figures

Adding the wooden and plastic action figures together, Peter will have:

8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops and compare it to the number of roses Ford can grow.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

Total roses required per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses required per month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks:
Total roses required per month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Next, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford can grow per month:
Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month (4 weeks), he can grow:
Total roses grown per month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Now, we can determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month:
Roses Ford lacks = Total roses required per month - Total roses grown per month
Roses Ford lacks = 260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

"To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to consider the cost of the new carpet, the padding, the removal of the old carpet, and the installation of the new carpet. We will calculate each of these costs based on the area of the bedroom and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the area of the bedroom:
Area = length × width
Area = 18 feet × 12 feet
Area = 216 square feet

Now, let's calculate each of the costs:

1. Cost of the new carpet:
Cost of carpet = area × cost per square foot
Cost of carpet = 216 square feet × $12/square foot
Cost of carpet = $2,592

2. Cost of the padding:
Cost of padding = area × cost per square foot
Cost of padding = 216 square feet × $2/square foot
Cost of padding = $432

3. Cost to remove the old carpet:
Cost of removal = area × cost per square foot
Cost of removal = 216 square feet × $4/square foot
Cost of removal = $864

4. Cost to install the new carpet:
Cost of installation = area × cost per square foot
Cost of installation = 216 square feet × $34/square foot
Cost of installation = $7,344

Now, let's sum up all the costs to get the total cost:
Total cost = Cost of carpet + Cost of padding + Cost of removal + Cost of installation

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage increase from the set temperature to the actual temperature when the oven is set to 450 degrees.

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the set temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

468 - 450 = 18 degrees

The percentage increase is:

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to so that it actually reaches 520 degrees, taking into account the 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x \) plus 4% of \( x \):

\( x + 0.04x = 520 \)

\( 1.04x = 520 \)

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\( x = \frac{520}{1.04} \)

\( x = 500 \)

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. So, the second movie is:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the duration of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups to the event.
4. Judy's friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so the friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils
- Friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils

"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00.
The discount on 1 box is 10% of $100.00, which is $10.00.
So, the discounted price of 1 box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost would be 2 * $90.00 = $180.00.

Now, let's determine how many contacts Pete gets from 2 boxes.
Since 1 box contains 90 contacts, 2 boxes will contain 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the number of contacts.
The cost per contact is $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

Since contacts are typically used in pairs, we need to find the cost per pair.
The cost per pair of contacts is $1.00 * 2 = $2.00.

The cost per pair of contacts is $2.00.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express these relationships as:

\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is 4500:

\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} \]
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

\[ R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:

\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option and then find the difference between them.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for 5 weeks, he will lose:
1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

If Martin eats donuts every day for 5 weeks, he will gain:
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight between the two options at the end of 5 weeks is:
8.75 pounds (gain from donuts) - (-6.25 pounds) (loss from Cheerios) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to calculate the number of people attending from each group of invitations.

1. Alex invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will bring 2 friends, so that's 100 * 2 = 200 additional people.
3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 additional people.

Now, let's add up all the people:

- 100 (initial invitees) + 200 (friends of initial invitees) + 10 (friends called) + 8 (spouses of friends called) = 318 people.

So, Alex will need 318 seats.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both Amazon and eBay, and then find the difference.

On Amazon:
- Cost of boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4
- Total cost on Amazon: $16 + $4 = $20

On eBay:
- Cost of boots: $13
- Shipping cost: $4 * 2 = $8 (since shipping on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon)
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we find the difference between the total costs:
- Difference: $21 (eBay) - $20 (Amazon) = $1

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles in height every day. We can represent the height of the beanstalk on day n as:

Height on day n = Initial height * 2^(n-1)

Where n is the number of days since planting. We want to find the smallest n such that the height is greater than 20 feet.

Let's calculate:

Day 1: 4 * 2^(1-1) = 4 * 2^0 = 4 * 1 = 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2^(2-1) = 4 * 2^1 = 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 4 * 2^(3-1) = 4 * 2^2 = 4 * 4 = 16 feet
Day 4: 4 * 2^(4-1) = 4 * 2^3 = 4 * 8 = 32 feet

On day 4, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is the first time it exceeds the 20 feet height of Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

Step 1: Since 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein, 200 grams of mushrooms will have twice the amount of protein, which is 3 grams * 2 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly protein intake from mushrooms is 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams/week.

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now we solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ 10 = 2J - J \]
\[ 10 = J \]

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To find out how many hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then determine how many hours he needs to work to earn that amount, taking into account the deposit he has already paid.

Here's the breakdown of the costs:

- Cost of 2 implants: 2 * $2000 = $4000
- Extra cost for porcelain crown: $500
- Total cost: $4000 + $500 = $4500
- Deposit already paid: $600
- Remaining amount to be paid: $4500 - $600 = $3900

Now, we need to calculate how many hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at a rate of $15 per hour:

- Hours needed to work: $3900 / $15 = 260

George needs to work 260 hours.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the second angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \) degrees, and the third angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} \]
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents and then divide that by the cost of one gumball, which is 5 cents.

First, let's convert each type of coin to its value in cents:

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:

200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

345 cents / 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"Dogs have 4 legs each, cats have 4 legs each, and birds have 2 legs each. To find the total number of legs, we can multiply the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and then add the results together.

For the dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
For the cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
For the birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Now, we add the legs together: 20 legs (dogs) + 8 legs (cats) + 20 legs (birds) = 48 legs

"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, which means he adds 50% of 8 pounds to the original 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds is 0.50 * 8 = 4 pounds.

So, the new weight is 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds.

However, this weight is too heavy, so he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds.

12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.

The weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

"To find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to determine the speed of the plane.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed of the plane is:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find out how long it would take to travel 2000 miles at this speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2 to find the hourly rate:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Now, let's calculate how many pounds Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly production as follows:

120 pounds * 3/4 = 90 pounds per hour

Now we know that in one hour, Ruiz can make 60 pounds and Marissa can make 90 pounds. If they work for 12 hours in a day, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates they make together in a day:

Ruiz's daily production: 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
Marissa's daily production: 90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

Adding both of their daily productions together gives us the total amount of chocolates made in a day:

720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Howard spends $8 on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16.
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

Now, let's add up the total amount Howard spent over the three days:

Total spent = Monday's spending + Tuesday's spending + Wednesday's spending
Total spent = $8 + $16 + $64
Total spent = $88

Howard originally had $100, so the amount of money he has left is:

Money left = Original amount - Total spent
Money left = $100 - $88
Money left = $12

For the next two hours:
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup * 2 hours = $12.00

Adding the two amounts together gives us the total earnings:
$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Patrick earned a total of $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires will undergo based on Jeremy's monthly driving distance and then determine how many months or years it will take to reach the tire's maximum rotation capacity.

First, we calculate the number of rotations per mile:
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Next, we calculate the number of rotations for 400 miles:
362.5 rotations per mile * 400 miles = 145,000 rotations per month

Now, we need to find out how many months it will take to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations per month = 72 months

Finally, we convert months into years:
72 months / 12 months per year = 6 years

So, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from the jumbo bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle gives 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, doubling the number of washes will give us the total number of washes with 1 pump per wash.

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Now, we need to find the cost per pump. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00, and there are 240 washes (or pumps) in the bottle. We divide the total cost by the number of washes to find the cost per pump.

$24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10 per wash (or per pump)

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100.

$0.10 * 100 = 10 cents

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost for each street and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
Cost for Monica's street = 150 meters * $194/meter

Then, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
Cost for Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194/meter

Finally, we find the difference in cost:
Difference in cost = Cost for Lewis' street - Cost for Monica's street

Let's do the math:

Cost for Monica's street = 150 * 194 = $29,100
Cost for Lewis' street = 490 * 194 = $95,060

Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

For the first 5 months, the cost is straightforward:
5 months * $100,000 / 5 months = $100,000

The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the total duration of the research is:
5 months * 10 = 50 months

The additional months of research are:
50 months - 5 months = 45 months

The cost per month for the additional 45 months is 50% more than the initial monthly cost. The initial monthly cost is $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month. Therefore, the increased monthly cost is:
$20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month

The cost for the additional 45 months is:
45 months * $30,000 per month = $1,350,000

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the additional 45 months to get the total cost:
$100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

The total cost of John's research is:

2. Determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators.
3. Calculate the number of remaining seats after the administrators have taken their seats.
4. Determine the number of seats occupied by the parents.
5. Calculate the number of seats occupied by the students.

Let's start with step 1:

Total number of seats = Number of rows × Number of seats per row
Total number of seats = 4 rows × 18 seats/row
Total number of seats = 72 seats

Step 2:

Seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 of total seats
Seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 × 72
Seats occupied by administrators = 18 seats

Step 3:

Remaining seats after administrators = Total seats - Seats occupied by administrators
Remaining seats after administrators = 72 - 18
Remaining seats after administrators = 54 seats

Step 4:

Seats occupied by parents = 1/3 of remaining seats
Seats occupied by parents = 1/3 × 54
Seats occupied by parents = 18 seats

Step 5:

Seats occupied by students = Remaining seats after administrators and parents
Seats occupied by students = Remaining seats after administrators - Seats occupied by parents
Seats occupied by students = 54 - 18
Seats occupied by students = 36 seats

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36.

1. Calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright.
2. Determine the number of women who can stay upright.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men.

Step 1: Total number of riders who can stay upright
25% of 100 riders can stay upright, so:
0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Step 2: Number of women who can stay upright
60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so:
0.60 * 25 = 15 women

Step 3: Number of men who can stay upright
Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
25 - 15 = 10 men

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The price of a diamond jewel is given as $2000.
2. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel.
3. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, we calculate the price of the gold jewel:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

Next, we calculate the price of the silver jewel:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

"To find out how many stamps Max bought in all, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then add them together.

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of each type of stamp together to find the total number of stamps Max bought:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. The difference in their speeds is the rate at which Tom is closing the gap.

Tom's speed: 70 mph
Bob's speed: 55 mph
Relative speed (Tom's speed - Bob's speed): 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is gaining 15 miles on Bob every hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. Naomi caught 17 fish.
2. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught \(17 - 6 = 11\) fish.
3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught \(11 + 3 = 14\) fish.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some. The total cost of the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total.

If Manny misses a class, the cost per class for the attended classes will increase. We need to find the point at which the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). The number of classes he will attend is \( 10 - x \). The cost per class when he misses \( x \) classes is \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the largest \( x \) such that \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \).

Solving the inequality:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

\[ 10x \leq 40 \]

\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes and the cost per class will still be $10 or less. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class will exceed $10, and his parents won't sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of customers each person processes daily and then calculate the total for a week.

1. Jewel processes 50 customers daily.
2. Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, so she processes 50 * 2 = 100 customers daily.
3. Together, they process 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers daily.
4. Since they work all days of the week, we multiply the daily total by 7 to get the weekly total: 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we can set up the problem with the information given:

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so if we let L represent the number of miles Lynn ran, then Reggie ran L + 3 miles.

Since we know Reggie ran 20 miles, we can set up the equation:

L + 3 = 20

Now, we solve for L:

L = 20 - 3
L = 17

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to first determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of one apple is:
$5.20 / 4 apples = $1.30 per apple

The cost of one orange is:
$3.30 / 3 oranges = $1.10 per orange

Now, we can calculate the cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
5 apples * $1.30 per apple = $6.50
5 oranges * $1.10 per orange = $5.50

The total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is:
$6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to calculate the volume of the hole and then multiply that by the time it takes him to shovel a cubic foot of earth.

The volume of the hole is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth:

Volume = Length × Width × Depth
Volume = 6 feet × 4 feet × 3 feet
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time to dig the hole is:

Total time = Volume × Time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 cubic feet × 3 seconds/cubic foot
Total time = 216 seconds

To convert the time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

Total time in minutes = 216 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute
Total time in minutes = 3.6 minutes

However, since the question asks for the final numerical answer and it is typically expected in the base unit used for the time per cubic foot (which is seconds in this case), we will provide the answer in seconds.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of all the additional features he has chosen.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: 1/3 of the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is 1/3 * $7,500 = $2,500
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500
6. Towing package: The cost of the towing package is not specified, so we will assume it is included in the ""several added features"" and needs to be accounted for. However, since the cost is not provided, we cannot include it in the calculation without additional information.

Now, let's add up all the known costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

Since the towing package cost is not provided, the total cost with the known features is:

"To calculate Tim's new annual salary after the promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new monthly salary after the 5% raise.
2. Calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary based on the new salary.
3. Calculate the total annual salary, which is the sum of the 12 months of the new salary and the bonus.

Step 1: New monthly salary after 5% raise
New monthly salary = Original monthly salary + (5% of original monthly salary)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + (0.05 * $20,000)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000
New monthly salary = $21,000

Step 2: Calculate the bonus
Bonus = 0.5 * New monthly salary
Bonus = 0.5 * $21,000
Bonus = $10,500

Step 3: Calculate the total annual salary
Total annual salary = (New monthly salary * 12) + Bonus
Total annual salary = ($21,000 * 12) + $10,500
Total annual salary = $252,000 + $10,500
Total annual salary = $262,500

So, Tim will make $262,500 in a year.

"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of the suits, the dress pants, and the dress shirts, and then add them all together.

1. The cost of the suits:
10 suits * $750/suit = $7500

2. The cost of the dress pants:
The dress pants cost 1/5 the cost of a suit, so:
$750/suit / 5 = $150/pair of dress pants
10 pairs of dress pants * $150/pair = $1500

3. The cost of the dress shirts:
He buys 3 dress shirts per suit, so:
10 suits * 3 dress shirts/suit = 30 dress shirts
30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800

Now, we add the costs together to get the total:
$7500 (suits) + $1500 (dress pants) + $1800 (dress shirts) = $10800

The total cost of everything is:

"To find out how much flour was in three bags in total before it was divided into portions, we first need to determine how much flour was in one bag. Since one bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion:

1 bag = 8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion

Now, to find out the total amount of flour in three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:

3 bags = 3 * (8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion)

Let's do the calculation:

3 bags = 3 * (8 * 2)
3 bags = 3 * 16
3 bags = 48 kilograms

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms.

"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

The formula to calculate distance is:
Distance = Speed × Time

For Alisa:
Distance (Alisa) = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours

For Stanley:
Distance (Stanley) = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours

Now we calculate each distance:

Distance (Alisa) = 12 × 4.5 = 54 miles
Distance (Stanley) = 10 × 2.5 = 25 miles

Now we add the distances together to get the total distance:

Total distance = Distance (Alisa) + Distance (Stanley)
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total distance = 79 miles

"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, and then add these times together.

First, we calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

Next, we calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so his rate is 4 feet per hour / 2 = 2 feet per hour.
- He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time to dig through the soil and the time to dig through the clay to get the total time:
- Total time = Time through soil + Time through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for Clara and Sheila, taking into account the discounts and vouchers.

First, let's calculate the cost for Clara:

- Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
- The total cost before the voucher is 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranate = $400.
- She got a $2 off voucher, so the final cost for Clara is $400 - $2 = $398.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Sheila:

- Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at the new price of $30 each.
- The total cost before the discount is 20 pomegranates * $30/pomegranate = $600.
- The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is 10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60.
- The final cost for Sheila after the discount is $600 - $60 = $540.

Now, we can find the difference between the final prices paid:

- The difference is $540 (Sheila's cost) - $398 (Clara's cost) = $142.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed for the guests.
2. Determine the number of whole eggs required based on the number of deviled egg halves.
3. Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Total number of deviled egg halves needed
Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
Total deviled egg halves = 3 halves/guest * 16 guests = 48 halves

Step 2: Number of whole eggs required
Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we can find the number of whole eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.
Number of whole eggs = 48 halves / 2 halves/egg = 24 eggs

Step 3: Convert whole eggs to dozens
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the number of whole eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
Number of dozens = 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

3. Monthly fuel expenses: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost (hanger rental + fuel expenses) and then multiply by 12 to get the annual maintenance cost.

Monthly maintenance cost: $5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000
Annual maintenance cost: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so the cooking time for pork is 30 minutes (for rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.
3. The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 minutes (for rice) + 50 minutes (for pork) = 80 minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.
4. To find out how long it took to cook all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans: 30 minutes (for rice) + 50 minutes (for pork) + 40 minutes (for beans) = 120 minutes.

So, the total cooking time for all the food is 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We know that the total number of legs is 70, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We also know that the total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

Now we can solve this system of equations. We can start by solving the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, we substitute \( G \) in the first equation with \( 20 - S \):
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
Kassidy's money = $90

Now, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
Rayna's money = $90 + $60
Rayna's money = $150

Now we have the amounts for all three individuals:
- Aurelia has $120
- Kassidy has $90
- Rayna has $150

To find out how much they would each have if they decided to add together their money and share equally, we need to sum their amounts and then divide by 3:

Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
Total money = $360

Now, we divide the total money by 3 to find out how much each person would have:

Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = $360 / 3
Money per person = $120

So, if they decided to share the money equally, each would have $120.

"To find out how many employees oversee the company, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of management employees.
2. Calculate the number of management employees who oversee the entire company.

Step 1: Calculate the number of management employees.
20% of 50 employees are management, so:
0.20 * 50 = 10 employees are management.

Step 2: Calculate the number of management employees who oversee the entire company.
30% of the management employees oversee the entire company, so:
0.30 * 10 = 3 employees oversee the company.

"To find out how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need to make 16 muffins, we need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for 16 muffins and then sum these amounts.

For 1 muffin, the dry ingredients required are:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons

For 16 muffins, the dry ingredients required are:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

Now, we add the amounts of flour, sugar, and salt to get the total amount of dry ingredients:
80 tablespoons (flour) + 48 tablespoons (sugar) + 4 tablespoons (salt) = 132 tablespoons

"To find out how much candy each of them would have if they shared equally, we need to add up all the candy they have and then divide it by the number of people.

Robert had 3 pounds of candy.
Cindy had 5 pounds of candy.
Aaron had 4 pounds of candy.

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

There are 3 people, so we divide the total candy by 3.

12 pounds / 3 people = 4 pounds per person

Each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.

"To find out how much change Adam got, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought and then subtract that from the $15 he paid.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is:
7 candies * $0.5/candy = $3.5

The cost of 10 candies of type B is:
10 candies * $0.75/candy = $7.5

The total cost of all candies is:
$3.5 + $7.5 = $11

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount Adam paid:
$15 - $11 = $4

So, Adam got $4 in change.

"Christina had a total of 12 good days in the past thirty days. The next three days included two good days and one neutral day. Therefore, the total number of good days after these three days would be 12 (from the past thirty days) + 2 (from the next three days) = 14 good days.

Since a month typically has 30 or 31 days, and we are considering a 30-day period, we have already accounted for 30 + 3 = 33 days. However, since we are only interested in the good days left in the month, we need to consider only the 30-day period.

The question asks for the number of good days left in the month after the next three days. Since the month has 30 days and we have already accounted for 33 days (30 past days + 3 next days), there are no days left in the month. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 0.

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:

\[ \text{Janey's books} = 2 \times S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 21 = 2 \times S + 3 \]

To find the number of books Sally has, we need to solve for \( S \):

\[ 21 - 3 = 2 \times S \]
\[ 18 = 2 \times S \]
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the growth rate is given in inches per day, we'll convert the initial height from feet to inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, the initial height of the bamboo in inches is:
20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

The target height is 600 inches. We need to find out how many inches the bamboo needs to grow to reach this height:

600 inches (target height) - 240 inches (current height) = 360 inches (growth needed)

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the growth needed by the growth rate:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches.

"James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs. There are 8 more dogs, so he needs to buy 8 toys to have enough for all 12 dogs. After buying the toys, he finds out there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are now 24 dogs in total (12 dogs * 2). He then needs to buy 12 more toys to have enough for all 24 dogs. When he comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs. Therefore, he now needs toys for 21 dogs (24 dogs - 3 dogs).

The total number of toys James needs is the sum of the toys he already has and the toys he needs to buy, minus the toys he no longer needs for the 3 dogs that are gone.

Toys on hand: 4
Toys bought for 8 more dogs: 8
Toys bought for 12 additional dogs: 12
Toys no longer needed for 3 dogs: -3

Total toys needed: 4 + 8 + 12 - 3

Now, let's calculate the total:

4 + 8 + 12 - 3 = 21

2. The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is:
   \( \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \)

3. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount:
   \( \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \)

4. The remaining amount after Frances's investment, which is Skyler's investment, is:

"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion based on the information that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

The proportion is as follows:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and divide:

x = (96 potatoes * 36 hash browns) / 6 potatoes

Now we can calculate the value of x:

x = (96 * 36) / 6
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes.

"To find out how many cookies they have in total, we need to determine how many cookies each person has based on the information given.

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we add up all the cookies to find the total:

Katarina's cookies: 68
Max's cookies: 73
Cookie Monster's cookies: 61
Summer's cookies: 96

Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96

Let's calculate the total:

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5L \).

She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim.

The final length of the dress is the sum of the original length, the extension, and the lace trim:

\[ L + 0.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the terms with \( L \):

\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Chris to mow half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, and then add the two times together.

First, let's find out how long it takes to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode. Since it takes 1 hour (60 minutes) to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode, it will take half that time to mow half the lawn:

60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode, it will take half that time to mow half the lawn:

40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the two times together to get the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn:

30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. \( T = R + 7 \) (one twin is 7 years older than one triplet)
2. \( 2T + 3R = 44 \) (the combined ages of the twins and triplets)

We can substitute the first equation into the second to solve for \( R \):

\( 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \)
\( 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \)
\( 5R + 14 = 44 \)
\( 5R = 44 - 14 \)
\( 5R = 30 \)
\( R = 30 / 5 \)
\( R = 6 \)

Now that we have the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins:

\( T = R + 7 \)
\( T = 6 + 7 \)
\( T = 13 \)

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo, we first need to determine the cost of one candy.

We know that:
- Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20.
- Each lollipop costs $0.40.

First, we calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Now we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the four candies:
$3.20 total cost - $2.00 cost of lollipops = $1.20 cost of four candies

Next, we find the cost of one candy:
$1.20 cost of four candies / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00
10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Finally, we add the cost of the 10 lollipops and the 10 candies to get the total cost:
$4.00 cost of 10 lollipops + $3.00 cost of 10 candies = $7.00

The total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $7.00.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have saved after ten years, we need to calculate the monthly savings for each and then multiply by the number of months in ten years.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, which means Neil saves 20 coins plus an additional 2/5 of 20 coins.

First, let's calculate how much more Neil saves compared to Rong:
2/5 * 20 coins = 8 coins

So Neil saves 20 coins + 8 coins = 28 coins every month.

Now, let's calculate the total savings for each after ten years (120 months):
Rong's total savings = 20 coins/month * 120 months
Neil's total savings = 28 coins/month * 120 months

Rong's total savings = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings = 3360 coins

Combined, they have saved:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20, so the total cost for the vaccines is:

2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40

Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we can write the cost of the heartworm check as:

0.60 * T

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

T = $40 + 0.60 * T

To find the total bill, we need to solve for \( T \). We can do this by isolating \( T \) on one side of the equation:

T - 0.60 * T = $40
0.40 * T = $40
T = $40 / 0.40
T = $100

So the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:

$125 - $100 = $25

2. Subtract that from the total percent of water used by the city to find the non-industrial use.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the percent of the river's water used for industrial purposes is:
40% * 80% = 0.40 * 0.80 = 0.32 or 32%

Step 2: The percent of the river's water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is the total percent used by the city minus the percent used for industrial purposes:
40% - 32% = 8%

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To find out how many quarts of ice cream would be made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate for each flavor and then multiply by the total time.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- The production rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- The production rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we'll calculate the total production for each flavor over 48 hours.

Chocolate ice cream production in 48 hours:
- 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts

Vanilla ice cream production in 48 hours:
- 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total ice cream production in 48 hours:
- 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts

"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of item before the discount:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up these amounts to get the total before the discount:

Total before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total:

Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total before discount to get the final total:

Total after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with her $6.00, we need to take into account the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free.

Each scoop costs $1.50, so for 2 scoops, Erin would pay $3.00. With the deal, she gets an additional scoop for free, which means for $3.00, she gets 3 scoops.

Erin has $6.00, which is enough to buy 2 sets of 2 scoops (paying $3.00 for each set) and getting 1 free scoop with each set. Therefore, she can get 2 sets of 3 scoops.

2 sets * 3 scoops/set = 6 scoops

Erin can buy 6 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate how much candy each of them has left after 14 days and then find the difference.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 4 pieces a day. After 14 days, she will have eaten:
4 pieces/day * 14 days = 56 pieces

So, Ginger will have:
100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces left

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 3 pieces a day. After 14 days, she will have eaten:
3 pieces/day * 14 days = 42 pieces

So, Amy will have:
100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces left

The difference in the amount of candy they have after two weeks is:
58 pieces (Amy) - 44 pieces (Ginger) = 14 pieces

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and then compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

First, let's calculate the cost of picking the blueberries:
- The fixed cost to go picking is $20.
- The cost per pound of blueberries picked is $1.5.
- James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.

The cost of the blueberries picked is:
30 pounds * $1.5/pound = $45

The total cost of picking the blueberries is:

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store:
- The cost per pound at the store is $2.5.
- James would need to buy 30 pounds.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is:
30 pounds * $2.5/pound = $75

Finally, to find out how much James saved, we subtract the total cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:
$75 (store cost) - $65 (picking cost) = $10

"To find out how many people accept the position, we need to follow the steps and calculate the numbers at each stage:

1. First, we calculate how many people receive interviews:
   100 people apply, and 30% of them receive interviews.
   100 * 30% = 100 * 0.30 = 30 people receive interviews.

2. Next, we calculate how many of those who receive interviews get a job offer:
   30 people receive interviews, and 20% of them receive a job offer.
   30 * 20% = 30 * 0.20 = 6 people receive a job offer.

"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of taps for the right foot:
- For the 3 minutes with her arms at her sides, she taps at 300 taps per minute.
- For the 2 minutes with her arms raised, she taps at 200 taps per minute.

Right foot taps:
(3 minutes * 300 taps/minute) + (2 minutes * 200 taps/minute) = 900 taps + 400 taps = 1300 taps

Next, we calculate the number of taps for the left foot:
- For the 3 minutes with her arms at her sides, she taps at 250 taps per minute.
- For the 2 minutes with her arms raised, she taps at 200 taps per minute.

Left foot taps:
(3 minutes * 250 taps/minute) + (2 minutes * 200 taps/minute) = 750 taps + 400 taps = 1150 taps

Now, we add the taps from both feet together to get the total number of taps:

"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices each group of friends ate and then subtract that from the total number of slices available.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, the total number of slices they ate is:
3 people * 12 slices per pizza * 2/3 = 3 * 12 * 2/3 = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. The total number of slices they ate is:
2 people * 12 slices per pizza * 3/4 = 2 * 12 * 3/4 = 2 * 9 = 18 slices

The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is:
24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Since each of the five friends ordered their own pizza, the total number of slices available was:
5 people * 12 slices per pizza = 60 slices

The number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:
60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

"To find the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine how long it takes the dog to eat nine sausages.

The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes, so we calculate the dog's time as follows:

Dog's time = 2/3 * Cat's time
Dog's time = 2/3 * 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

Now we have the time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages:

- Cat's time: 30 minutes
- Dog's time: 20 minutes

To find the average time, we add the two times together and divide by 2:

Average time = (Cat's time + Dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

Topher's shoe length in inches is:
8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we are given that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. We can set up the following equation:

\( 9x + 10 = 100 \)

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\( 9x = 100 - 10 \)
\( 9x = 90 \)
\( x = 90 / 9 \)
\( x = 10 \)

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find out how many windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows:
- A quarter of 256 windows is 256 / 4 = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows:
- Three-quarters of 64 windows is 64 * (3/4) = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars to get the total:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students' windows) + 48 (teachers' windows) = 112 windows.

Number of blue spools = 15 + 45
Number of blue spools = 60

Total number of spools = Number of light blue spools + Number of dark blue spools + Number of light green spools + Number of dark green spools
Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50
Total number of spools = 150

Percentage of blue spools = (Number of blue spools / Total number of spools) * 100

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

Beck's apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's apples = 100 - 23
Beck's apples = 77

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, we need to adjust the number of apples each has:

Boris's new number of apples = Boris's original apples - 10
Boris's new number of apples = 100 - 10
Boris's new number of apples = 90

Beck's new number of apples = Beck's original apples + 10
Beck's new number of apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new number of apples = 87

Now we can calculate how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the transaction:

Fewer apples = Boris's new number of apples - Beck's new number of apples
Fewer apples = 90 - 87
Fewer apples = 3

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

- Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
- Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Now, we add up the water used for all the cubes:

12 ounces (giant) + 14 ounces (medium) + 4 ounces (small) = 30 ounces

Now, we can solve for Steven's books:

Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven:

Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now we can determine how many more books Clara has than Alice:

- Old cost per tomato: $0.5
- New cost per tomato: $0.4
- Savings per tomato: $0.5 - $0.4 = $0.1
- Number of tomatoes sold per day: 500
- Daily savings: 500 tomatoes * $0.1 savings per tomato = $50

Now, to find the weekly savings:
- Number of days in a week: 7
- Weekly savings: $50 daily savings * 7 days = $350

The vendor saves $350 a week.

"If Sean has 56 marbles, and Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, then Carl has:

4 * 56 = 224 marbles

Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, Cal has:

2 * 56 = 112 marbles

To find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together:

224 + 112 = 336 marbles

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to consider the number of weekdays and weekends in that period.

There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week. In a 4-week month, there are:
- 5 weekdays * 4 weeks = 20 weekdays
- 2 weekend days * 4 weeks = 8 weekend days

For two 4-week months, we have:
- 20 weekdays * 2 months = 40 weekdays
- 8 weekend days * 2 months = 16 weekend days

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented:
- Weekdays: 40 weekdays * 60 chairs/day = 2400 chairs
- Weekends: 16 weekend days * 100 chairs/day = 1600 chairs

Adding these together gives us the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
2400 chairs + 1600 chairs = 4000 chairs

"Let's break down the events to find out how many bananas Gunther had at the end.

1. Gunther originally had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas, so Gunther was left with 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, so he then had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.
4. Arnold then stole another 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.
5. On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas to his pile, so he then had 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

So, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

"To find out how much each roommate, including Jenna, will pay per year for electricity, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total annual cost of the electricity bill.
2. Divide the total annual cost by the number of roommates to find the individual share.

Step 1: The monthly electricity bill is $100, so the annual cost is:
$100 * 12 months = $1200

Step 2: There are 5 people sharing the cost (Jenna and her 4 roommates), so each person's share is:
$1200 / 5 people = $240 per person per year

So, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity.

"Jeff initially sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party. A dozen is equal to 12, so:

- Glasses: 8 dozen * 12 = 96 glasses
- Plates: 4 dozen * 12 = 48 plates

When the items were returned, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. So, the remaining items are:

- Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42 plates

The total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now is the sum of the remaining glasses and plates:

- Total remaining items: 86 + 42 = 128

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons:
   - 90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Since 1 large button is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

3. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons:
   - 50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Since 1 large sticker is worth 1 large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

4. She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons:
   - She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Since 1 large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

5. Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has:
   - Large buttons: 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons.
   - Small buttons: 30 - 27 (traded small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 3 + 60 = 63 small buttons.

6. The total number of buttons is the sum of large and small buttons:
   - Total buttons = 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons.

Since a large button is worth 3 small buttons, we can convert all buttons to a common unit (small buttons) to get the total count:
- 29 large buttons * 3 small buttons/large button = 87 small buttons.
- Total small buttons = 87 + 63 = 150 small buttons.

Therefore, Lorraine has 150 buttons by the end.

"To find out how many matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the number of matches he played on each day.

On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, we add the matches from each day together:

2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches

So, Joey played 7 matches in one week.

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the information given, we have:

\[ F = 2A \]

Since the total number of people on the council is 33, the sum of the votes in favor and against must be 33:

\[ F + A = 33 \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second to solve for \( A \):

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now that we have the number of votes against the regulation, we can find the number of votes in favor:

\[ F = 2A \]
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break down the information given:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, so:
   \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \) students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so:
   \( 22 - 4 = 18 \) students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so:
   \( 18 / 2 = 9 \) students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so:
   \( 9 + 6 = 15 \) students need size extra-large.

Now, we add up all the shirts needed for each size:

\( 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 \)

Krissa needs to order 75 shirts in total.

50 people - 10 people = 40 people

Next, we calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win, which is 60% of the remaining 40 people:

60% of 40 people = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

Now, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people to find out how many think horse #12 will win:

40 people - 24 people = 16 people

So, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can work backwards from the information given.

First, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. This means that the total number of Pomeranians is three times the number of Pomeranian girls, because 1/3 of the Pomeranians = 6, so:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3 = 18

Next, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If 18 is two thirds of the total number of puppies, we can find the total number of puppies by dividing the number of Pomeranians by 2 and then multiplying by 3:

Total Puppies = (18 / 2) * 3 = 9 * 3 = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the second needs twice the first).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since it needs double the first).

The total number of cases for all three houses is 250, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

The third house needs double the first house, so it will need:

\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

The third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to consider her hourly rate and the additional daily rate if she teaches more than 3 classes.

On Monday:
- She teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3, so she gets an additional $5 for the day.
- She works for 5 hours at $15 per hour, so her earnings for the hours worked are 5 * $15 = $75.
- Adding the additional daily rate, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday:
- She teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3, so she does not get the additional $5 for the day.
- She works for 2 hours at $15 per hour, so her earnings for the hours worked are 2 * $15 = $30.
- Since she does not get the additional daily rate, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Adding the earnings from both days:
- Total earnings = Monday's earnings + Wednesday's earnings = $80 + $30 = $110.

Therefore, Tanya earned $110 for these two days of teaching.

"To calculate the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to consider the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

First, we calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time to drive to the museum is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time to museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since the trip back home is the same distance and he drives at the same speed, the time to drive back is also 2 hours.

Now, we add the time spent at the museum, which is 6 hours.

Total time gone from home = Time to museum + Time at museum + Time back home
Total time gone from home = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours
Total time gone from home = 10 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying more fish, he had a total of:
- 3 + (number of orange fish bought) orange fish
- 4 + (number of white fish bought) white fish

We know that after buying the fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of orange fish bought as O and the number of white fish bought as W. The total number of fish bought is 17, so we have:

O + W = 17

And we also know that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish after the purchase:

3 + O = 2 * (4 + W)

Now we can solve these equations. First, we'll express O in terms of W from the first equation:

O = 17 - W

Now we substitute O in the second equation:

3 + (17 - W) = 2 * (4 + W)
20 - W = 8 + 2W
20 - 8 = 2W + W
12 = 3W
W = 12 / 3
W = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

1/4 * 40 = 10 smart TVs

One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, so:
1/8 * 40 = 5 analog TVs

The rest of the sales are OLED TVs, so we subtract the number of smart and analog TVs from the total:
40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25 OLED TVs

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is:

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the temperature at night.
2. Determine the difference between the night temperature and the freezing point.
3. Calculate how many logs are needed to raise the temperature to at least 32 degrees.

Step 1: Calculate the night temperature.
Night temperature = Day temperature - 33 degrees
Night temperature = 45 degrees - 33 degrees
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Step 2: Determine the difference between the night temperature and the freezing point.
Difference = Freezing point - Night temperature
Difference = 32 degrees - 12 degrees
Difference = 20 degrees

Step 3: Calculate how many logs are needed.
Each log heats the house by 5 degrees, so the number of logs needed is:
Number of logs = Difference / Degrees heated per log
Number of logs = 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log
Number of logs = 4

Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of groups formed.
2. Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups.

Step 1: Determine the total number of groups formed.
Since 90 people are split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9 to get the total number of groups:
90 / 9 = 10 groups

Step 2: Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.
3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, so we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:
10 * (3/5) = 6 groups

Step 3: Calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups.
Each of the 6 groups had 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells. So, we multiply the number of groups by the number of members per group and then by the number of seashells each member brought back:
6 * 9 * 2 = 108 seashells

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many people are on the train after the stops, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of people on the train: 172.
2. Subtract the number of people who get off at the first stop: 172 - 47.
3. Add the number of people who get on at the first stop: (172 - 47) + 13.
4. Subtract the number of people who get off at the next stop: ((172 - 47) + 13) - 38.

Let's do the math:

172 - 47 = 125 (after the first stop, 47 people get off)
125 + 13 = 138 (after 13 people get on)
138 - 38 = 100 (after the next stop, 38 people get off)

So, the final number of people on the train is:

"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily value of the bottle caps he finds.
2. Multiply the daily value by the number of days in the month.

Step 1: Daily value of bottle caps
- Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day.
- Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.
- So, the daily value is 10 bottle caps * $0.25/bottle cap = $2.50.

Step 2: Monthly value of bottle caps
- There are 30 days in the month.
- The monthly value is 30 days * $2.50/day = $75.00.

Therefore, Damien makes $75.00 in a 30-day month.

"To calculate Jamie's pay for the 11 hours she worked, we need to consider her regular pay for the first 8 hours and her overtime pay for the additional 3 hours.

Regular pay for 8 hours:
$20/hour * 8 hours = $160

Overtime pay for 3 hours:
150% of $20/hour is $20/hour * 1.5 = $30/hour
$30/hour * 3 hours = $90

Total pay for 11 hours:
$160 (regular pay) + $90 (overtime pay) = $250

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans and then subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill he uses to pay.

First, we calculate the discount amount:
25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price:
$40 - $10 = $30

Now, we subtract the sale price from the $50 bill to find out how much change Mike will receive:
$50 - $30 = $20

So, Mike will have $20 left over after paying for the jeans.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly payroll.
3. Multiply the total monthly payroll by the number of months to get the total amount paid after three months.

Step 1: Total number of employees after three months
Initial number of employees: 200
Number of new employees hired each month: 20
Number of months: 3

Total number of new employees hired in three months: 20 * 3 = 60
Total number of employees after three months: 200 + 60 = 260

Step 2: Total monthly payroll
Monthly salary per employee: $4000
Total monthly payroll: 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000

Step 3: Total amount paid after three months
Total amount paid after three months: $1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

"To find out how long the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total time for singing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and ""Jingle Bells"" once.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, and they will sing it twice, so:
150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long, and they will sing it once, so:
240 seconds * 1 = 240 seconds

Now, we add the time for both songs together to get the total caroling time:
300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds

Therefore, the choir will be caroling for a total of 540 seconds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Billy's starting hourly rate: $10.00
2. Billy's raise after 2 months: $0.50
3. Billy's hourly rate after 2 months: $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50
4. Billy's raise on his first anniversary: $1.00
5. Billy's hourly rate on his first anniversary: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50

Sally's starting hourly rate is $0.50 more than Billy's starting rate, so:
6. Sally's starting hourly rate: $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50

Now, we calculate how much each of them earns for 20 hours of work:
7. Billy's earnings for 20 hours: $11.50 * 20 = $230.00
8. Sally's earnings for 20 hours: $10.50 * 20 = $210.00

Finally, we find out how much more Billy earns than Sally:
9. Difference in earnings: $230.00 - $210.00 = $20.00

So, Billy will earn $20.00 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.

The total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To find out how many trees will be planted at the end of the campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students each.
- So, the total number of students is 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students.
- Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000 trees.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes with 3 teachers each.
- So, the total number of teachers is 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

Now, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees = Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers
- Total trees = 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees.

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her collection, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14 stuffed animals.

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of the total, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x - 0.30 \times x = 0.30 \times 14 \]
\[ 0.70 \times x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats to make them 30% of her collection.

"Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so for 2 weeks, that's 14 days. Half an hour is 0.5 hours, so:

14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. That's 7 days, so:

7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Adding the two amounts together gives the total hours played:

7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So the number of hours she still needs to play is:

30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

"To find out how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car will travel in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, the two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours.

"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials and then add the 30% premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. So, the total cost of the materials is:

$600 (diamond) + $300 (gold) = $900

Next, we calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials:

30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the materials to find out the final amount James paid:

$900 (materials) + $270 (premium) = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring.

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, we calculate the pass rate for each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is 340/500.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is 40/100.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. Since there are 400 fifth graders, the number who passed is 400 * (80/100).

Now we calculate the number of fifth graders who passed:

400 * (80/100) = 400 * 0.8 = 320

Next, we add up the number of students who passed from all grades:

340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 320 (fifth graders) = 700

Now we add up the total number of students:

500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:

700 (total passed) / 1000 (total students) = 0.7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.7 * 100 = 70%

The school's overall pass rate is 70%.

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, divide the total square inches by 3 to find the length in inches.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total number of glass chips:
   Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips.
   Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

2. Total square inches of mosaic:
   It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch.
   Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

3. Length of the mosaic:
   The mosaic is 3 inches tall, so to find the length, we divide the total square inches by the height.
   Length = Total square inches / Height
   Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea that was consumed and then add the 10 quarts that were left over. After that, we convert the total quarts to gallons, knowing that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students who each drank 1.5 quarts:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Next, we calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students who each drank 2 quarts:
16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, we add the tea consumed by all the students together:
6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

Then, we add the 10 quarts that were left over to find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party:
38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Finally, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of May and then subtract the initial number of students (10) to find out how many additional students have joined.

Let's break it down month by month:

- At the beginning of the year (January), there are 10 students.
- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, to find the number of additional students that have joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students (10) from the total number of students at the end of May (320).

"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals for each type of flower Rose picked, subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped, and then sum the remaining petals.

1. For the first set of flowers, she picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals

2. For the second set of flowers, she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals

3. For the third set of flowers, she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals

4. For the last set of flowers, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals

Now, we add up all the petals:
15 petals + 24 petals + 20 petals + 42 petals = 101 petals

Since she dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals of one flower from each set:
1 flower * 5 petals/flower = 5 petals
1 flower * 6 petals/flower = 6 petals
1 flower * 4 petals/flower = 4 petals
1 flower * 7 petals/flower = 7 petals

Total petals from the dropped flowers:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent by Jack and his three friends playing the arcade games for 4 hours.

First, let's determine how long each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate how many quarters each person will use in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
- Two friends: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters each
- One friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Now, we calculate the total number of quarters used:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: 24 quarters each, so 24 * 2 = 48 quarters
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used = 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is:
68 quarters * $0.25 per quarter = $17.00

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The total mixture is 10 ounces.
2. The amount of citrus zest (Z) is the same as the amount of fragrance (F).
3. The amount of salt (S) is the same as the amount of sugar (G).
4. The amount of oil (O) is twice the amount of salt.
5. The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:

Z = F
S = G
O = 2S
S = 2Z

Since the total mixture is 10 ounces, we can write:

Z + F + S + G + O = 10

Substituting the relationships into the equation, we get:

Z + Z + S + S + 2S = 10
2Z + 2S + 2S = 10
2Z + 4S = 10

Since S = 2Z, we can substitute 2Z for S:

2Z + 4(2Z) = 10
2Z + 8Z = 10
10Z = 10
Z = 1

Now that we know Z (zest) is 1 ounce, we can find S (salt):

S = 2Z
S = 2(1)
S = 2

And now we can find O (oil):

O = 2S
O = 2(2)
O = 4

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the terms with \( P \):

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick has:

\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And finally, we can find out how many cards Becca has:

\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"Cindy had 5 green eggs. She had twice as many blue ones as green ones, which means she had 10 blue eggs. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 9 pink eggs. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, which means she had 3 yellow eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of each color of eggs together:

5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"To calculate how much money Milly will lose, we need to consider the cost of shipping the book back and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
- The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
- The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.

Shipping cost for weight = 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
Shipping cost for distance = 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Next, let's calculate the refund amount:
- The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.

Refund amount = $32 * 75% = $32 * 0.75 = $24.00

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
- Milly will lose the difference between the book's cost and the refund, plus the shipping cost.

Total loss = (Book cost - Refund amount) + Shipping cost
Total loss = ($32 - $24) + $3.00
Total loss = $8.00 + $3.00
Total loss = $11.00

Milly will lose $11.00.

"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. Time spent recording TikTok videos:
- Each video is 4 minutes long.
- She records 18 videos each week.
- In a month with four weeks, she records 18 videos/week * 4 weeks = 72 videos.
- The total time spent recording videos is 72 videos * 4 minutes/video = 288 minutes.

2. Time spent writing amateur songs:
- She spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
- In a month with four weeks, she spends 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.
- Converting hours to minutes, 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

3. Time spent doing makeup:
- She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing makeup.
- In a month with four weeks, she does makeup 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 24 days.
- The total time spent doing makeup is 24 days * 15 minutes/day = 360 minutes.

Now, we add up all the time spent on these activities in a month:
288 minutes (recording) + 480 minutes (writing songs) + 360 minutes (makeup) = 1128 minutes.

To convert the total time into hours and minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
1128 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 18 hours and 48 minutes.

However, since the question asks for the final numerical answer, we will provide the total time in minutes:

"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to determine the cost of the additional items she needs installed beyond what is included in the standard installation package.

The standard package includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves (not needed by Angela)
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Angela has:
- 6 mirrors (2 additional mirrors needed)
- 2 chandeliers (1 additional chandelier needed)
- 20 pictures (10 additional pictures needed)

The cost for additional items is $15.00 per item. So, we need to calculate the cost for 2 additional mirrors, 1 additional chandelier, and 10 additional pictures.

The total number of additional items is:
2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 items

The cost for the additional items is:
13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00

Now, we add the cost of the additional items to the standard installation cost:
$129.00 (standard installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela will be:
$324.00

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more, we calculate 40% of Anthony's savings: 40% of $30.00 = 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00.
4. Therefore, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this, we need to calculate the height each person can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working our way up to Naruto.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches high.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches high.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Naruto's lifting height to feet:

480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet

Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it would take for the turtles to travel the same distance.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance is the same for one kangaroo, as they are traveling at the same speed. Therefore, one kangaroo would also take 18 hours to travel the same distance.

Now, if a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it would take twice as long for a turtle to travel the same distance. So, one turtle would take 18 hours * 2 = 36 hours to travel across the highway.

Since we have four turtles, and they are all traveling at the same speed, the time it takes for them to travel the distance does not change with the number of turtles, as they are not helping each other to travel faster. Each turtle will still take 36 hours to travel the distance individually.

Therefore, it will take 36 hours for one turtle, and consequently, it will also take 36 hours for four turtles to travel across the highway.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after the trade-in, her part-time job pay, and her mom's contribution, and then subtract the amount she still needs to buy the laptop.

The cost of the new laptop is $600, but with the trade-in, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is:

$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom is giving her $80, so the total amount from these sources is:

$150 + $80 = $230

Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means the total amount she has (including the money in her purse) is:

$400 (new price of the laptop) - $50 (amount still needed) = $350

Now, to find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we subtract the amount she received from her job and her mom from the total amount she has:

$350 (total amount she has) - $230 (amount from job and mom) = $120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

Next, we calculate the number of slices from the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

We know that:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, let's find out how many students are good at both subjects. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students:

Total students = 20
Students good at math only = 5
Students good at English only = 8

Students good at both = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)
Students good at both = 20 - (5 + 8)
Students good at both = 20 - 13
Students good at both = 7

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

6 minutes to perform
2 minutes to exit the stage
Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. We need to subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the performances.

Total performance time = Total concert time - Intermission time
Total performance time = 120 minutes - 10 minutes
Total performance time = 110 minutes

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to use the formula for simple interest:

\[ A = P(1 + rt) \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this case, the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which means \( r = \frac{3}{4} \) of \( P \) per year. However, the interest rate should be a fraction of the principal, not the principal itself. Since the interest is three-quarters of the original amount, the interest rate is actually 75% or 0.75.

Let's plug in the values:

- \( P = 300 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.75 \)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Now we can calculate the total amount:

\[ A = 300(1 + 0.75 \times 3) \]
\[ A = 300(1 + 2.25) \]
\[ A = 300 \times 3.25 \]
\[ A = 975 \]

2. Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months.
3. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 badges every month.

Now, let's calculate the number of badges each person earns in a year (12 months):

- Claire earns 1 badge/month * 12 months/year = 12 badges/year.
- Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months, so she earns 1/2 badge/month * 12 months/year = 6 badges/year.
- Wendy earns 3 badges/month * 12 months/year = 36 badges/year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to calculate how many burritos were eaten and subtract that from the total number of burritos ordered.

First, we calculate the number of burritos eaten by the students:
50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

Next, we add the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George:
500 burritos + 20 burritos = 520 burritos

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos:
600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 12 red cars.
- There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.
- There are 3 times the number of blue cars as there are green cars, so there are 10 * 3 = 30 blue cars.
- The total number of cars is 75.

To find the number of yellow cars, we need to subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

75 (total cars) - 12 (red cars) - 10 (green cars) - 30 (blue cars) = 23 yellow cars.

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as A, the number of books that Sofie has as S, and the number of books that Fawn has as F.

According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. Together, they have 85 books:
   S + A + F = 85

2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:
   S = A + 25

3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:
   A = F - 12

We can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to solve for F.

First, we substitute A from the third equation into the second equation to express S in terms of F:
   S = (F - 12) + 25
   S = F + 13

Now we substitute S and A from the second and third equations into the first equation:
   (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
   3F + 1 = 85
   3F = 84
   F = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find out how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make that many cups.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per box.

Step 1: Total number of jello cups needed
- There will be 30 kids, and each kid will have 4 jello cups.
- Total jello cups = 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups

Step 2: Number of three-ounce boxes required
- Each box makes 10 small jello cups.
- Number of boxes needed = Total jello cups / Cups per box = 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes

Step 3: Total cost
- Each box costs $1.25.
- Total cost = Number of boxes * Cost per box = 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.00

So, Greg will spend $15.00 on jello.

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much of the grocery cost Keenan is responsible for. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%.

The total monthly grocery cost is $400. So, Keenan's share of the monthly cost is 40% of $400.

Keenan's monthly cost = 40% of $400
Keenan's monthly cost = 0.40 * $400
Keenan's monthly cost = $160

Since there are four weeks in the month, we divide Keenan's monthly cost by 4 to find the weekly cost.

Keenan's weekly cost = Keenan's monthly cost / 4
Keenan's weekly cost = $160 / 4
Keenan's weekly cost = $40

So, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries.

"To find out how many pieces of pizza Tobias has eaten so far, we need to calculate the amount he ate each day and then sum those amounts.

First, we calculate how many pieces he ate on the first day:
2/5 of 60 pieces = (2/5) * 60 = 24 pieces

Next, we know he ate 10 pieces on the second day.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days:
60 pieces - 24 pieces (first day) - 10 pieces (second day) = 26 pieces remaining

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces:
7/13 of 26 pieces = (7/13) * 26 = 14 pieces

Finally, we sum the pieces he ate over the three days:
24 pieces (first day) + 10 pieces (second day) + 14 pieces (third day) = 48 pieces

So, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far.

"To find out how much 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water will cost, we need to calculate the cost per bottle for each and then multiply by the number of bottles David wants to buy.

First, let's find the cost per bottle of soda:
7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, so 1 bottle of soda costs $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

Next, let's find the cost per bottle of water:
4 bottles of water cost $8.00, so 1 bottle of water costs $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda will cost 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
2 bottles of water will cost 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Adding these together, the total cost will be $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

"To calculate Amy's total score, we need to determine how many points she earns from each type of question and then sum them up.

1. For the multiple-choice questions:
- There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly.
- 80% of 10 is 0.80 * 10 = 8 questions.
- Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 * 1 = 8 points.

2. For the true/false questions:
- There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly.
- 90% of 20 is 0.90 * 20 = 18 questions.
- Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 * 1 = 18 points.

3. For the long-answer questions:
- There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly.
- 60% of 5 is 0.60 * 5 = 3 questions.
- Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points.

"To find out how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market for sale, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Subtract the profit from the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them.
Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5) = 180 chickens

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
Isaias sells each chicken for $50.
Total revenue = 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

Step 3: Subtract the profit from the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.
Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000.
Cost of the chickens = Total revenue - Profit
Cost of the chickens = $9000 - $2000 = $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses the boys sold together.

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses (boys' sales combined)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the boys' sales by 2 to find out how many each boy sold.

18 glasses (boys' sales combined) / 2 = 9 glasses (each boy's sales)

Now we know that Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales.

14 glasses (Julie's sales) - 9 glasses (Micah's sales) = 5 glasses

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. The cost of doing her hair is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of doing her hair, so:
   \[ \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, so:
   \[ \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up the costs of all the services:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hair cost} + \text{Manicure cost} + \text{Pedicure cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 575 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling her rope.
2. Determine the length of the new rope she can buy with the money from the sale.
3. Calculate the cost of the new rope.
4. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money received from the sale to find out how much money she will have left over.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Sarah's rope is 20 meters long and she sells it for $2 a meter.
   Total money from sale = 20 meters * $2/meter = $40

2. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter. We need to find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy with $40.
   Length of new rope = Total money from sale / Cost per meter of new rope
   Length of new rope = $40 / $1.5/meter = 26.666... meters

Since Sarah can't buy a fraction of a meter of rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope.

3. The cost of the new rope is:
   Cost of new rope = 26 meters * $1.5/meter = $39

4. The money left over after buying the new rope is:
   Money left over = Total money from sale - Cost of new rope
   Money left over = $40 - $39 = $1

So, Sarah will have $1 left over after she buys the new rope.

"To solve the problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 10 from 18.

18 - 10 = 8

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the equation:

Future age = 3 * Current age

Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be three times her current age. Then we can write:

8 + x = 3 * 8

Now we solve for \( x \):

8 + x = 24
x = 24 - 8
x = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

- The total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, so each pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2.
- Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4.
- Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
- Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the items:

- The total cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.
- The total cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
- The total cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

- Total cost of bacon: $10
- Total cost of chicken: $24
- Total cost of strawberries: $12
- Total cost of apples: $14

Total cost of all items: $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we need to subtract the 15-minute encore from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide the result by 2, since the final concert (excluding the encore) is twice as long as her usual concerts.

The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Subtracting the 15-minute encore gives us:

65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

This 50 minutes is twice the length of her usual concert, so we divide by 2 to find the length of a usual concert:

50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To find out how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange on the stage, we first need to determine how many microphones did not find any space to fit in. Since 20% of the microphones won't fit, we can calculate this number as follows:

20% of 50 microphones = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means that 10 microphones did not fit into the pairs. Therefore, the number of microphones that were paired is:

50 microphones - 10 microphones = 40 microphones

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is:

40 microphones / 2 microphones per pair = 20 pairs

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to first determine the speed of a thingamabob, since the speed of a whirligig is based on the speed of a thingamabob.

We know that:
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

Let's denote the speed of a thingamabob as \( T \) meters per second. Then, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11T \).

Since the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:
\[ 11T = 121 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ T = \frac{121}{11} \]
\[ T = 11 \]

Now that we know the speed of a thingamabob is 11 meters per second, we can find the speed of a whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob:
\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5T \]
\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times 11 \]
\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 55 \]

So, the whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( c \).

The cost of the salad is $6.
The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = $3 \).

Ellen eats two carrots, so the cost for the carrots is \( 2c \).

The total cost for her daily food is the sum of the cost of the two carrots, the salad, and the yogurt, which is \( 2c + 6 + 3 \).

We know that the total cost is $11, so we can write the equation as:
\[ 2c + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Now, we can solve for \( c \):
\[ 2c + 9 = 11 \]
\[ 2c = 11 - 9 \]
\[ 2c = 2 \]
\[ c = \frac{2}{2} \]
\[ c = 1 \]

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that amount from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

From the information given:
- The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
- The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, we can assume that the $6 is the total amount she earned from mowing Joe's lawn. Therefore, if she mowed Joe's lawn \( J \) times, and the total payment is $6, then the payment per mow for Joe's lawn is \( \frac{6}{J} \).

Now, we need to calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
- Earnings from mowing Joe's lawn: \( 6 \) dollars.
- Earnings from mowing Kamala's lawn: \( 3J \times \frac{6}{J} = 18 \) dollars.
- Earnings from mowing Alba's lawn: \( 5J \times \frac{6}{J} = 30 \) dollars.

The total earnings from mowing lawns is the sum of the earnings from each lawn:
\( 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \) dollars.

Since Tasha made a total of $80 last month, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\( 80 - 54 = 26 \) dollars.

"To calculate John's profit from renting out his car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month.
2. Calculate the total income from renting the car.
3. Subtract the car payment from the total income to find the profit.

Step 1: Total number of hours rented out
John rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so:
10 times * 3 hours/time = 30 hours

Step 2: Total income from renting the car
John gets paid $25 an hour, so for 30 hours, he earns:
30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Step 3: Calculate the profit
John's car payment is $500, so his profit is:
$750 (income) - $500 (car payment) = $250

Therefore, John's profit from renting out his car is $250.

1. Martha originally had \( M \) notebooks.
2. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had \( 3M \) notebooks.
3. Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has \( M + 5 \) notebooks.
4. We are told that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has a total of 7 notebooks, so \( M + 5 = 7 \).
5. Solving for \( M \), we get \( M = 7 - 5 \), which means \( M = 2 \).

"Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since he is eating with his adult wife and their two children, we need to calculate how much soup will be left after they all have one bowl each for dinner.

1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls (since 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls, 1 adult bowl = 8/4 = 2 child bowls).

Calvin and his wife will eat 2 adult bowls, which is equivalent to 4 child bowls (2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl).

The two children will eat 2 child bowls in total (1 child bowl per child * 2 children).

So, the total number of child bowls eaten for dinner is 4 (from the adults) + 2 (from the children) = 6 child bowls.

The pot originally holds 8 child bowls, so the number of child bowls left after dinner is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

"William bought five notebooks and one ballpen. The cost of the notebooks is 5 notebooks * $1.50 per notebook, and the cost of the ballpen is $0.50. The total cost is the sum of these two amounts.

Total cost = (5 * $1.50) + $0.50

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

Total cost = (5 * 1.50) + 0.50
Total cost = 7.50 + 0.50
Total cost = 8.00

So, William spent $8.00 in all.

"To find out how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- To make 20 small masks, we need to find out how many sets of 4 masks are in 20 masks, which is 20 / 4 = 5 sets.
- Since each set requires 2 yards of material, 5 sets will require 5 * 2 = 10 yards of material.

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- To make 8 large masks, we need to find out how many sets of 3 masks are in 8 masks, which is 8 / 3 ≈ 2.67 sets (rounded to two decimal places).
- Since each set requires 2.25 yards of material, 2.67 sets will require 2.67 * 2.25 ≈ 6.0075 yards of material (rounded to four decimal places).

Now, we add the material required for both types of masks:
- Material for small masks: 10 yards
- Material for large masks: 6.0075 yards

Total material required: 10 + 6.0075 = 16.0075 yards

Since material is typically measured in whole or half yards, we can round up to the nearest half yard to ensure Jo has enough material. 16.0075 yards rounded up to the nearest half yard is 16.5 yards.

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to calculate the total number of tickets she bought and then divide the total amount of money she spent by that number.

First, we calculate the total number of tickets:
- There are 9 movies in the Fast and the Furious series.
- Deepa has seen each movie 3 times.

Total number of tickets = Number of movies * Number of times seen per movie
Total number of tickets = 9 * 3
Total number of tickets = 27

Now, we know that Deepa spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
Average price per ticket = $216 / 27
Average price per ticket = $8

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends on activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the hours spent on these activities:
10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

There are 24 hours in a day, so we subtract the hours spent on activities from the total hours in a day to find out how much free time Harold has:
24 - 19 = 5 hours.

"Tim originally has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes, so the number of red shoe boxes used is:
1/3 * 9 = 3 red shoe boxes

The number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes

The total number of shoe boxes left is the sum of the blue and red shoe boxes left:
4 + 6 = 10 shoe boxes

"Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We can write this as an equation:

\[ D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

We are also given that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So we can substitute \( D \) with 60 in the equation:

\[ 60 - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 \]
\[ A + 8 = 38 \]

Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To find out how many acres the two farms have together, we first need to calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 400 acres. Adding 100 acres to that, Farmer Smith's farm is:

400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres

Now, to find the total acreage of both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres

So, together the two farms have 700 acres.

"To find out how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many packages Colby completes per hour.
2. Calculate his hourly earnings.
3. Multiply his hourly earnings by the number of hours in a workday to find his total earnings.

Step 1: Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, which is:
50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Step 2: He gets paid $0.20 for every package, so his hourly earnings are:
40 packages/hour * $0.20/package = $8.00 per hour.

Step 3: To find his total earnings for an eight-hour workday, we multiply his hourly earnings by 8:
$8.00/hour * 8 hours = $64.00.

So, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday.

"To solve this, we need to calculate the total time John spends on an extreme Sudoku puzzle and then determine how many bottles of water he drinks during that time.

A normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and an extreme Sudoku takes 4 times that long. So, the time for an extreme Sudoku is:

45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is every 30 minutes. To find out how many bottles he drinks in 180 minutes, we divide the total time by the interval at which he drinks:

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water during the time it takes him to complete an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( r \) as the number of red balloons,
- \( y \) as the number of yellow balloons.

We know that:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon,
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon,
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna,
- There are 20 red balloons.

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown can be represented by the equation:
\[ 2r + 3y = 58 \]

Since we know \( r = 20 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Now, we solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen (12) balloons at $0.5 for 2 balloons is \( 12 \div 2 \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = $3 \).
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each is \( 2 \times 7 = $14 \).

The total amount spent is \( 11 + 3 + 14 = $28 \).

Since this amount is the combined allowance of Julia and Nadine, we divide it by 2 to find out how much each received:
\( 28 \div 2 = $14 \).

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:
300 lollipops * $0.8/lollypop = $240

Then, we calculate the total cost of purchasing the lollipops:
300 lollipops * $0.5/lollypop = $150

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
$240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

2. Subtract the number of cinnamon tea cups from the total number of cups to find out how many cups are left for chamomile and mint tea.
3. Divide the remaining cups equally between chamomile and mint tea.
4. Since the remaining cups are divided into 3 rows, we will then divide the number of mint tea cups by 3 to find out how many are in each row.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total cups of cinnamon tea: 15
2. Total cups of tea: 27
3. Remaining cups for chamomile and mint tea: 27 - 15 = 12
4. Since there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, we divide the remaining cups by 2: 12 / 2 = 6
5. These 6 cups of mint tea are divided into 3 rows: 6 / 3 = 2

So, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his total expenses for the month and subtract that from the $150 he was given.

First, let's calculate the cost of the movies he has already seen:
- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays at $10 each: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days at $7 each: 8 * $7 = $56

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorn and candy he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy at $2 each: 4 * $2 = $8

Now, let's add up all his expenses so far:
- Movies: $50 + $56 = $106
- Snacks: $16 + $8 = $24
- Total expenses: $106 + $24 = $130

Colby has $150 to spend, so let's see how much he has left:
- Remaining money: $150 - $130 = $20

On the last day of the month, which is a Friday, he wants to see a movie, get a popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for this will be:
- Movie ticket: $10
- Popcorn: $8
- Candy: $2
- Total for the night: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

Since the total for the night is exactly $20, which is the amount he has left, he can see 1 more movie.

"To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one, so it has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.
- Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls are 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.

Next, we calculate the calories for the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one, so it has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.
- Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories for the mini blueberry muffins are 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we add the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins to get the total calories for all the pastries:
- Total calories = 40,000 calories (mini cinnamon rolls) + 45,000 calories (mini blueberry muffins) = 85,000 calories.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, which is 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as Monday, which is again 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:

39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday) + 78 (Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 300 Junebugs.

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance.

The formula to calculate distance is:
Distance = Speed × Time

For the bus:
Distance_bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
Distance_car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance to find out how much farther the bus went:
Distance_bus - Distance_car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as P, Pa, and J, respectively.

According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   P + Pa + J = 100

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   Pa = J + 10

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   P = Pa + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third to express Peter's age in terms of Jean's age:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now we can substitute the expressions for P and Pa from the second and third equations into the first equation:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
4J + 20 = 100
4J = 80
J = 20

Now that we have Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:

Pa = J + 10
Pa = 20 + 10
Pa = 30

And finally, we can find Peter's age:

P = Pa + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

So, Peter is 50 years old.

"To find out how many pounds of hay Nate needs, we need to calculate the total amount of hay for the goats and the sheep separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the amount of hay needed for the goats:
- Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
- There are 15 goats.
- So, the total amount of hay for the goats is 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = 75 pounds.

Next, we calculate the amount of hay needed for the sheep:
- Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
- Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds.
- So, each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds of hay.
- There are 12 sheep.
- So, the total amount of hay for the sheep is 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.

Finally, we add the total amount of hay for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:
- Total hay needed = hay for goats + hay for sheep = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

Money After Pencils = Remaining Money - Cost of Pencils
Money After Pencils = 150 dollars - 50 dollars
Money After Pencils = 100 dollars

Finally, we'll determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the money left after buying the pencils:

Number of Pens = Money After Pencils / Cost per Pen
Number of Pens = 100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen
Number of Pens = 4

"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in a row by the number of rows, and then multiply that by the number of schools.

Number of children in a row: 8
Number of rows per school: 7
Number of schools: 5

Total number of children = 8 children/row * 7 rows/school * 5 schools

Now, let's calculate the total:

Total number of children = 8 * 7 * 5

Total number of children = 56 * 5

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher gets from redeeming all the coupons.
2. Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students.
3. Subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles to find out how many are left for the teacher.

Step 1: Total bottles from coupons
The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.
Total bottles = 9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Step 2: Bottles given to students
There are 29 pupils, and each gets 2 bottles of apple juice.
Bottles given to students = 29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

Step 3: Bottles left for the teacher
Bottles left for the teacher = Total bottles - Bottles given to students
Bottles left for the teacher = 900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to add the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. Visit fee: $40
2. Labor cost: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours.
3. Parts cost: $60

Now, let's calculate the labor cost for 3 hours:
Labor cost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, we add all the costs together:
Total charge = Visit fee + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60

Total charge = $205

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs with the 40% discount.

The original cost of one CD is $15. With a 40% discount, the price of one CD is reduced by 40% of $15.

The discount on one CD is:
$15 * 40% = $15 * 0.40 = $6

So, the discounted price of one CD is:
$15 - $6 = $9

The total cost for 10 CDs at the discounted price is:
10 * $9 = $90

James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40 in total. So, the amount he recovers from selling 5 CDs is $40.

The net amount James was out is the total cost of the CDs minus the amount he recovered from selling 5 of them:
$90 - $40 = $50

Therefore, the final amount of money James was out is:
$50"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings from selling her root crops, we need to multiply the number of each type of crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.0

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.0

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.0

Now, we add up the earnings from each type of crop to get the total earnings:
$9.0 + $20.0 + $5.0 = $34.0

Jen will earn $34.0 if she sells everything.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time for each part of James's journey.

1. **Swimming the first part:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is 0.60 * 20 = 12 miles.
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - The time to swim 12 miles is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - The rest time is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

3. **Swimming the remaining part:**
   - The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.
   - James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
   - The time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

4. **Total time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time spent swimming the first part, resting, and swimming the remaining part.
   - Total time = 6 hours (first part) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (remaining part) = 17 hours.

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can set up the equation based on the information given:

Let the number of loaves Sam had last Friday be S.
According to the problem, S = 70.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had, which can be expressed as:
Bakery's loaves = 7 * S - 40

Now we substitute the value of S into the equation:
Bakery's loaves = 7 * 70 - 40
Bakery's loaves = 490 - 40
Bakery's loaves = 450

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then add them together.

For the New York Times:
- Each copy costs $5.
- The commission is 10% of $5, which is $5 * 0.10 = $0.50 per copy.
- For 6 copies, the total commission is $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy costs $15.
- The commission is 8% of $15, which is $15 * 0.08 = $1.20 per copy.
- For 10 copies, the total commission is $1.20 * 10 = $12.00.

Adding the commissions from both newspapers:
- Total commission = $3.00 (New York Times) + $12.00 (Wall Street Journal) = $15.00.

The total commission Cayley will earn is $15.00.

"To find Leo's age, we first need to determine Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, who is 26 years old.

So, Marcus's age is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo’s age. Therefore, to find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus's age by 2:

21 * 2 = 42 years old

Leo is 42 years old.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati as B, by Azibo as A, and by Dinar as D. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. B + A + D = 45 (the total points scored by the team)
2. B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

From the second equation, we can express A in terms of B: A = B - 20.
From the third equation, we can express D in terms of B: D = B - 10.

Now we can substitute A and D in the first equation with their expressions in terms of B:

B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45
3B - 30 = 45
3B = 75
B = 25

Now that we know B (Bahati's score), we can find A (Azibo's score):

A = B - 20
A = 25 - 20
A = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find out how many reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling and then determine how many reports he can staple in that time.

First, let's calculate the total time in minutes:

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Now, we know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals there are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:

900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we can find the total number of reports by multiplying the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

So, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports.

"Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. In minutes, that is 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

On the day she sleepwalked, she was out of bed from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so instead of waking up at 6 a.m., she woke up at 5:55 a.m. This means she lost an additional 5 minutes of sleep.

The total time she lost from her usual sleep is 23 minutes (sleepwalking) + 5 minutes (waking up early) = 28 minutes.

Therefore, the total time she slept on her bed that day is 480 minutes (usual sleep time) - 28 minutes (lost sleep time) = 452 minutes.

"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. If he has two dozen cups, that means he has 24 measuring cups (since one dozen equals 12).

To find out how many measuring spoons he has, we calculate 2/3 of 24:

\[ \text{Measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

If he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he will have:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

So, Jonathan will have 10 measuring spoons left.

Now, to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Total utensils} = 24 \text{ (measuring cups)} + 10 \text{ (measuring spoons)} = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

If 50 patients are admitted each day, over the course of 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted will be:

50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients.

The total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks will be the initial unoccupied beds minus the number of patients admitted:

2. Calculate the number of emails to family: Two-thirds of the 9 non-work emails are to family, so (2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.
3. Calculate the number of emails to her boyfriend: One-third of the remaining emails (after work and family) are to her boyfriend. Since 9 - 6 = 3 emails are left, (1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find out how old Shawna's father is, we need to first determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age.

Given that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Now that we know Shawna is 9 years old, we can find out how old Shawna's father is. Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number but overstated the number by 20%, we can find the actual number of people who attended the concert by calculating what 100% (the actual number) would be.

Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \). According to the information, Courtney's count (48) is 120% of the actual number, because she overstated by 20%.

So we can write the equation as:
\[ 1.20 \times x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now we calculate the value of \( x \):
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day and then use the information that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.

Let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:

- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes

Total holes by the end of the third day: 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day should be:

4 * 10 = 40 holes

Now, to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes by the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:

40 (total by the end of the fourth day) - 29 (total by the end of the third day) = 11 holes

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as A, by Stan as S, and by Alex as X.

According to the problem, we have the following equations:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339:
   A + S + X = 339

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   X = S + 5

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe:
   S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the second equation into the first to eliminate X:

A + S + (S + 5) = 339
A + 2S + 5 = 339
A + 2S = 334

Now we can substitute the third equation into the above equation to eliminate S:

A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
A + 8A - 26 = 334
9A - 26 = 334
9A = 360
A = 40

Now that we have the value for A, we can find S:

S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then multiply that by the length of each episode.

We know that each episode is 20 minutes long and that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. This means that the number of episodes is 20 / 2, which is 10 episodes.

Now, to find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance the bird traveled in each direction and then sum the distances traveled south, subtracting the distance traveled north.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 10 hours = 300 miles

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 18 mph * 2 hours = 36 miles

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 22 mph * 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we add the distances traveled south and subtract the distance traveled north to find the total distance between the two homes:

Total distance south = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles
Total distance north = 36 miles

Net distance between the homes = Total distance south - Total distance north
Net distance between the homes = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

1. Greta made a batch of 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself.
2. She was sent home with 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office party.
3. Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies for her surprise party.
4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.

First, we convert all the dozens to individual brownies (1 dozen = 12 brownies):

- 1 dozen from her batch = 12 brownies
- 1/2 dozen from her office = 6 brownies
- 4 dozen from her friends = 48 brownies
- 1 1/2 dozen eaten = 18 brownies

Now, we add the brownies she had:

12 (her batch) + 6 (office) + 48 (friends) = 66 brownies

Then, we subtract the brownies that were eaten:

66 (total) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 24 - 19 = 5 years older than he is now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad. So, his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
4. Since Emil will be 24 and that is twice the age of his brother, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old at that time.
5. To find out the current age of Emil's dad, we subtract 5 years from his age when Emil is 24, so his dad is 48 - 5 = 43 years old now.

"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more than her mother, which is 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, which is 20 * 2 = 40 beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend together:

20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

"Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

The total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days is 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, then the total number of servings Joe has is 21 / 3 = 7 servings.

"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Now, we have 30 - 6 = 24 students remaining.

Out of these remaining students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

So, the total number of students leaving early is the sum of the football players and the cheerleaders or band members:

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band) = 12 students

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the width of the flowers from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy.
3. Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed.
4. Subtract the number of plants Pat already owns from the total number of plants needed.
5. Calculate the cost of the additional plants needed.

Let's start with step 1:
- Each flower grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot (since 12 inches = 1 foot).

Step 2:
- Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between them, so the total space each plant will occupy is 1 foot (the plant itself) + 1.5 feet (the space between plants) = 2.5 feet.

Step 3:
- The flower bed is 111 feet long. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant occupies: 111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4 plants.
- Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

Step 4:
- Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs 44 - 17 = 27 more plants.

Step 5:
- Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for 27 plants is 27 * $6 = $162.

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"To find out how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply that by the number of baskets.

For one basket, the cost of the petunias is:
3 petunias * $3.00 per petunia = $9.00

The cost of the sweet potato vines for one basket is:
2 sweet potato vines * $2.50 per vine = $5.00

The total cost for one basket is:
$9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00

Now, to find the total cost for all 5 baskets, we multiply the cost of one basket by the number of baskets:
$14.00 per basket * 5 baskets = $70.00

So, the total amount Katherine will spend is:
$70.00"
"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then see how much soil is left for the roses.

First, we calculate the soil used for the sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Next, we calculate the soil used for the carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations to find the total soil used:
12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds

We started with a 30-pound bag of soil, so we subtract the total soil used from the initial amount to find out how much soil is left for the roses:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is equal to the remaining soil:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes for each task and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she can peel them:

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes to saute 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can find out how many minutes it takes to saute 90 shrimp by dividing the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can saute in 10 minutes and then multiplying by 10:

(90 shrimp / 30 shrimp) * 10 minutes = 3 * 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to saute them:

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sauteing) = 45 minutes

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature change for each period the air conditioner was running and when it was off.

1. On low for 3 hours: The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees per hour.
   Temperature change = 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees cooler

2. On high for 4 hours: The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees per hour.
   Temperature change = 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees cooler

3. Off for 2 hours: The room warms up 2 degrees per hour.
   Temperature change = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees warmer

Now, we combine these changes to find the total temperature change from the starting point.

Total temperature change = (6 degrees cooler) + (12 degrees cooler) - (4 degrees warmer)
Total temperature change = 18 degrees cooler - 4 degrees warmer
Total temperature change = 14 degrees cooler

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Bill's dad saw Comet Halley when he was 30 years old.
2. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, so the next time it would be visible would be 75 years after the dad saw it.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since his father was 30, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.
4. Since the comet appears every 75 years, and Bill saw it a second time when he was 90, we can determine that the first time he saw the comet was 75 years before he was 90, which means he was 90 - 75 = 15 years old.

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

"Buford writes checks for the following purposes:

- Electric bill: 1 check per month
- Gas bill: 1 check per month
- Church: 2 checks per month
- Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter (4 times a year)

To find the total number of checks he writes per year, we can calculate:

- Electric bill: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
- Gas bill: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
- Church: 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year
- Pest and lawn service: 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year

Adding these together gives us the total number of checks per year:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks/year

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which means \( \frac{3}{4}F \) flights are to Greece. The remaining flights, which are \( \frac{1}{4}F \), are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes is twice the number of flights the second plane makes, which is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \).

Now we can calculate the number of flights to France by the first plane:

\( F = 88 \)
Number of flights to France = \( \frac{1}{8}F = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \)

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add up the durations of their howls:
20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) + 60 (Igneous) = 120 seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the total seconds to minutes:
120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: 3 years
- Alessandro: 4 years
- Helene: H years
- Wilfred: W years

The total age of the children is given as 20 years, so we can write the equation:

3 (Akbar) + 4 (Alessandro) + H (Helene) + W (Wilfred) = 20

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So we can write:

H = 2 * (20 / 4)

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now we can substitute the value of H back into the total age equation:

3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20

Solving for W:

17 + W = 20
W = 20 - 17
W = 3

So, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"To find out how many people were in the church next door, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests.
2. Determine how many cookies were given to the church.
3. Calculate how many people in the church received 15 cookies each.

Step 1: Total number of cookies brought by the guests
There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.
Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Step 2: Number of cookies given to the church
The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church.
Cookies given to the church = 1/2 * 1500 cookies = 750 cookies

Step 3: Number of people in the church who received 15 cookies each
Each person in the church received 15 cookies.
Number of people = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

So, 50 people were in the church next door.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a ratio to represent the distribution of the watermelon slices. Let's say each kid's slice is represented by 1 unit. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be 2 units.

There are 4 kids, so the total units for the kids' slices are:
4 kids * 1 unit/kid = 4 units

There are 2 adults, so the total units for the adults' slices are:
2 adults * 2 units/adult = 4 units

The total units of the watermelon are the sum of the kids' and adults' units:
4 units (kids) + 4 units (adults) = 8 units

Each adult gets 2 units out of the total 8 units. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the following formula:

(Units per adult / Total units) * 100%

So for each adult, the percentage is:
(2 units / 8 units) * 100% = 25%

"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he will spend on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from his total available time at the clinic.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds:
- He has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient.
- 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments:
- He has 10 appointments and each takes 30 minutes.
- 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

Now, let's convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments into hours:
- 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.
- 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

Finally, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total available time:
- 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time required for each step and then subtract that total from the time she wants to serve the cake.

The total time required is:
- 20 minutes to make the cake batter
- 30 minutes to bake the cake
- 2 hours to cool the cake
- 10 minutes to frost the cake

Let's convert all the times to minutes for easier calculation:
- 20 minutes (batter)

- 2 hours = 120 minutes (cooling)
- 10 minutes (frosting)

Now, let's add up the total time in minutes:
20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find the latest time she can start, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's call the number of chocolate bars in a box ""x"".

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5 * x chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5 * x chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Combining like terms, we get:

8x = 64

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 64 / 8
x = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the following:

1. The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. The cost per student per session is $1.50.
3. There are 10 students.
4. The studio is rented 3 days a week.

First, we calculate the total cost per session:
- Studio rental cost per session: $25
- Cost per student per session: $1.50 * 10 students = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we calculate the total cost per week:
- Total cost per session * 3 sessions per week = $40 * 3 = $120

Now, we need to determine the number of weeks in a month. For simplicity, we'll assume an average month has about 4 weeks.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month:
- Total cost per week * 4 weeks = $120 * 4 = $480

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month would be the total cost, which is the amount the studio would need to cover. However, if you are asking for the revenue (which is the income before expenses), we need to calculate the income from the students:

- Income per student per session: $1.50
- Total income per session: $1.50 * 10 students = $15
- Total income per week: $15 * 3 sessions = $45
- Total income per month: $45 * 4 weeks = $180

So, the expected earnings (revenue) of the dance studio in a month would be $180.

480 (if asking for total cost)
180 (if asking for revenue) 

Since the question asks for the expected earnings, which typically refers to revenue, the answer is:

"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to first determine how many chocolate bars are in each of their boxes.

Let's start with Peter. If Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars, we can find the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = Total chocolate bars / Number of boxes
Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = 64 / 4
Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = 16

Now, let's do the same for Martha. If Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars, we can find the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = Total chocolate bars / Number of boxes
Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = 56 / 7
Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = 8

Now we can find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha by subtracting the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:

More chocolate bars in Peter's boxes = Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes - Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes
More chocolate bars in Peter's boxes = 16 - 8
More chocolate bars in Peter's boxes = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find out how many porcupines will be in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of babies born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
4. Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population to get the final population.

Step 1: Number of female porcupines
The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population of 50.
Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Step 2: Number of babies born each month
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
Babies born each month = Number of female porcupines * 4
Babies born each month = 30 * 4 = 120

Step 3: Total number of babies born in a year
There are 12 months in a year.
Total babies born in a year = Babies born each month * 12
Total babies born in a year = 120 * 12 = 1440

Step 4: Final population after a year
Final population = Initial population + Total babies born in a year
Final population = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Convert the volume to gallons using the given conversion factor.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool based on the price per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.
The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.
\[ \text{Gallons} = V \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.
The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so:
\[ \text{Cost} = \text{Gallons} \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

The cost to fill the pool will be $826.

"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled and then subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance.

The formula to calculate distance is:
Distance = Speed × Time

For Matteo:
Distance_Matteo = Speed_Matteo × Time_Matteo
Distance_Matteo = 55 mph × 4 hours
Distance_Matteo = 220 miles

For Shandy:
Distance_Shandy = Speed_Shandy × Time_Shandy
Distance_Shandy = 45 mph × 10 hours
Distance_Shandy = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove:
Distance_Shandy - Distance_Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles
Distance_Shandy - Distance_Matteo = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into parts and calculate the number of female students in each age group.

1. Students over 16 years old:
- Half of the 3000 students are over 16, so there are 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16.
- One-fourth of the students over 16 are male, so there are 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16.
- The rest of the students over 16 are female, so there are 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16.

2. Students under 16 years old:
- The other half of the 3000 students are under 16, so there are also 1500 students under 16.
- One-half of the students under 16 are male, so there are 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.
- The rest of the students under 16 are female, so there are 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16.

3. Total number of female students:
- To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B on both days and then subtract that from the tank's total capacity to find out how much water is remaining.

First, let's calculate the amount of water pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day:
  \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons

- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day:
  \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons

Now, let's calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day:
  \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons

- Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day:
  \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons

Now, let's add up all the water pumped into the tank over the two days:

If the power bank lost 7% per hour, then each hour it retained 93% (100% - 7%) of its charge from the previous hour. We can reverse this process by dividing the final charge by 0.93 for each of the 3 hours.

Let's calculate the charge before the 7% loss per hour for 3 hours:

28% / 0.93 = 30.11% (after 2 hours of 7% loss)
30.11% / 0.93 = 32.37% (after 1 hour of 7% loss)
32.37% / 0.93 = 34.80% (before the 7% loss started)

Next, we need to account for the 5 hours where the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour. Similarly, if the power bank lost 9% per hour, it retained 91% (100% - 9%) of its charge from the previous hour. We can reverse this process by dividing the charge by 0.91 for each of the 5 hours.

Let's calculate the charge before the 9% loss per hour for 5 hours:

34.80% / 0.91 = 38.24% (after 4 hours of 9% loss)
38.24% / 0.91 = 42.02% (after 3 hours of 9% loss)
42.02% / 0.91 = 46.18% (after 2 hours of 9% loss)
46.18% / 0.91 = 50.75% (after 1 hour of 9% loss)
50.75% / 0.91 = 55.77% (before the 9% loss started)

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.77%.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10,000.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Next, we need to determine how much Janet earns in a week. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, which totals to $25 an hour.

$10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

$25 per hour * 40 hours = $1,000 per week

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2,000, which is the amount needed for the down payment.

$2,000 (total needed) / $1,000 (weekly earnings) = 2 weeks

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment for the car.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up these costs to find the total amount spent so far:

$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining money is:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"Anne had 15 packs of sweets, and each pack contains 60 pieces. She kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends. Since she has 10 friends, and she wants to distribute the 13 packs equally, each friend will receive 13 / 10 = 1.3 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces, each friend will receive 1.3 * 60 = 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

Final Price = Initial Price * (1 + Rate of Increase) ^ Number of Years

In this case, the initial price is $120, the rate of increase is 5% or 0.05, and the number of years is 3.

Final Price = $120 * (1 + 0.05) ^ 3

Let's calculate the final price:

Final Price = $120 * (1.05) ^ 3
Final Price = $120 * 1.157625
Final Price = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the final price is:

"To find out how many portraits and selfies Olivia had, we need to first determine how many pictures were in each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies and 2 albums were portraits. To find out the total number of selfies and portraits, we multiply the number of pictures per album by the number of albums for each category:

Selfies: 3 albums * 9 pictures/album = 27 pictures
Portraits: 2 albums * 9 pictures/album = 18 pictures

Adding the selfies and portraits together gives us the total number of selfies and portraits:

27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45 pictures

"To find out how long James spends reading, we can set up a proportion based on the information given. If James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages.

The proportion is as follows:

3 pages / 10 minutes = 18 pages / x minutes

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and divide:

x = (18 pages * 10 minutes) / 3 pages

Now we calculate x:

x = 180 / 3
x = 60

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To find out how many guests the hotel now has, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations.

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so we subtract 24 from 100:
   100 - 24 = 76 guests remaining.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so we subtract 15 from the remaining 76:
   76 - 15 = 61 guests remaining.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests had a late checkout, twice that number is:
   2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.
5. We add these 30 guests to the 61 remaining:
   61 + 30 = 91 guests.
6. After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so we add 7 to the 91:
   91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The hotel now has 98 guests.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( L = 3S \) and \( S = $4 \).

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( x \) and the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( y \). The problem states that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \( x = 2y \).

The total earnings from the sales are given as $120, which is the sum of the earnings from the small and large stuffed animals. We can write this as:

\[ 4x + 3(4)y = 120 \]

Since \( x = 2y \), we can substitute \( 2y \) for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 4(2y) + 3(4)y = 120 \]
\[ 8y + 12y = 120 \]
\[ 20y = 120 \]
\[ y = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

Now that we know \( y \), the number of large stuffed animals sold, we can find \( x \), the number of small stuffed animals sold:

\[ x = 2y \]
\[ x = 2(6) \]
\[ x = 12 \]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day, and then multiply that by the number of dwarves and the number of days in the month.

1. First, we find out how much ore a dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe:
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so:
     12 pounds * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

2. Next, we calculate how much ore a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe:
   - A steel pickaxe allows a dwarf to mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so:
     24 pounds * 1.5 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

3. Now, we find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes:
   - 40 dwarves * 36 pounds per dwarf = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

4. Finally, we calculate the total amount of ore mined in a month with 30 days:
   - 1440 pounds per day * 30 days = 43200 pounds of ore.

"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the information that the prices are proportional. This means that the cost per sandwich is the same for all package sizes.

First, we calculate the cost per sandwich for the first two packages:

- For the first package, the cost per sandwich is $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.
- For the second package, the cost per sandwich is $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the cost per sandwich is the same for both packages, we can use this to find the cost of the third package with 8 sandwiches:

- The cost for 8 sandwiches would be 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12.

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sally starts with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.
2. 40% of the red balloons burst, so she loses 40% of 25, which is 10 red balloons. She now has 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.
3. She releases half of the yellow balloons, so she loses 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. She now has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.
4. She finds 8 blue balloons and adds 75% of them to her clutch. 75% of 8 is 6 blue balloons. She adds these to her remaining balloons.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he would not have to turn it in and then subtract that from 100%.

1. There's a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
2. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. This means there's a 50% * 40% = 20% chance that the normal teacher will give an extension.
3. If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension (50% * 60% = 30% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. This means there's a 30% * 20% = 6% chance that Marcus will get a personal extension.

Now, we add up all the probabilities where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- 50% (substitute teacher)
- 20% (normal teacher gives an extension)
- 6% (Marcus gets a personal extension)

50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

The chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is the complement of the above probability:

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family by subtracting the seats for graduates and faculty from the total number of seats.
2. Divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the math:

Total seats in the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Seats available for friends and family = Total seats - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
Seats available for friends and family = 6000 - 950 - 300
Seats available for friends and family = 4750

Now, we divide the seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates:

Tickets per graduate = Seats available for friends and family / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

Earnings per day = $15
Total earnings for 3 days = $15 * 3 = $45

Next, let's calculate her total expenses:
Parking cost per day = $3
Total parking cost for 3 days = $3 * 3 = $9

Now, we subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find the net earnings:
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9 = $36

Finally, we divide the net earnings by the total number of hours spent on jury duty to find the pay per hour:
Total hours spent = 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours
Pay per hour after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours spent
Pay per hour after expenses = $36 / 18 hours = $2

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place and the time it will take to move between them.

First, we calculate the number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of bottles is:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

However, since he starts at the first bottle, he will only need to move between the bottles, which means he will move 7 times (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, until the 7th to the 8th).

It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. Therefore, the total time to move between all the bottles is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Since the question asks for the total time to set off all the soda fountains, and we assume that the time to drop the candy into the bottle is negligible or included in the 5 seconds of movement, the total time is 35 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's education, including the loans and the income he did not earn while in college. Then we need to determine how long it will take for him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. Calculate the total amount of loans:
   $50,000 per year * 4 years = $200,000

2. Calculate the income Jim did not earn while in college:
   $25,000 per year * 4 years = $100,000

3. Calculate the total cost of college (loans + lost income):
   $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

4. Calculate Jim's new income after college:
   $25,000 (old income) * 3 = $75,000 (new income)

5. Calculate the additional income Jim earns per year after college:
   $75,000 (new income) - $25,000 (old income) = $50,000 (additional income per year)

6. Calculate how long it will take to earn the equivalent of the total cost of college:

"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will be using. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, and Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of the fabric piece will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of the fabric piece will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 on the first race, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $10 + $1 = $11.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race loss: $5
- Second race gain: -$11 (since it's a win, it reduces the total loss)
- Third race loss: $16.50

Total loss = $5 - $11 + $16.50 = $11.50

"Let's denote the amount the first person took as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took \( x + 80 \) dollars, and the third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is the sum of the shares of the three people, which is \( 1920 \) dollars. So we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \) dollars.

"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide that by the number of painters.

First, we need to determine the total number of days the painters worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is:

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Next, we calculate the fraction of a day they worked each day, which is 3/8 of a day. To find the total hours worked by the team, we need to convert the fraction of a day to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

3/8 of a day * 24 hours/day = 9 hours/day

Now, we can find the total hours worked by the team over the 21 days:

9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked:

189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours

Each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

According to the problem, in the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls, and in the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 - 4 \]

\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} = 15 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first need to combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we can find a common denominator, which is 2:

\[ \frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = 15 \]

\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 15 \]

Now, we can solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by 2 and then dividing by 5:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x \), the number of balls retrieved in the second set, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set, which is \( x + 4 \):

\[ 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we can use the formula for exponential decay, which is:

Final Value = Initial Value * (1 - rate of depreciation) ^ number of years

In this case, the initial value is $20,000, the rate of depreciation is 21% or 0.21, and the number of years from 2007 to 2010 is 3.

Final Value = $20,000 * (1 - 0.21) ^ 3
Final Value = $20,000 * (0.79) ^ 3
Final Value = $20,000 * 0.493039
Final Value = $9,860.78

Rounded to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is $9,860.78.

"To calculate the cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to determine how many tiles are required to cover the entire area and then multiply that by the cost per tile.

1. First, we find out how many tiles are needed. Since each tile is 1 square foot (1ft x 1ft), and the kitchen floor is 200 square feet, we need 200 tiles to cover the entire floor.

2. Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile. The cost per tile is $12.

Total cost = Number of tiles * Cost per tile
Total cost = 200 tiles * $12/tile
Total cost = $2400

"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's time as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan took, which is 98 minutes. So we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Solving for \( D \):

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]
\[ 2D = 98 - 18 \]
\[ 2D = 80 \]
\[ D = 40 \]

Now that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find out how long Betsy's part took:

\[ Betsy's\ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

So, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To find out how much Anthony spends on postage, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of big coupons:
- Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he will send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

Next, we calculate the cost for the small coupons:
- Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

Then, we calculate the cost for the big coupons:
- Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Finally, we add the costs together to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of small coupons + cost of big coupons = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
- Total cost in dollars = 24500 cents / 100 = $245.

"Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter to make 6 dozen croissants, as he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter Dennis buys at full price, he gets the next pound at half price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. For the first pound, he pays $4.00, and for the second pound, he pays $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. So for every two pounds, he pays $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds, we can divide this by 2 to find out how many times he will take advantage of the promotion:
6 pounds / 2 pounds per promotion = 3 times the promotion.

The total cost for 6 pounds of butter will be:
3 times * $6.00 = $18.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is $18.00.

Together, the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, the total daily consumption for all three monkeys is 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas each day.

Now, to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the total eaten by the first two monkeys from the total daily consumption:

45 bananas (total daily consumption) - 24 bananas (eaten by the first two monkeys) = 21 bananas.

"To find out how much Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Each banana costs $0.80.
- Jenny bought 10 bunches, with each bunch averaging 4 bananas.
- So, the total number of bananas is 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.
- The cost of 40 bananas at $0.80 each is 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Jenny bought 10 bunches, so the total cost is 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):

\( S + (S + 60) = 100 \)

Combine like terms:

\( 2S + 60 = 100 \)

Since John has 2 extra classes, we add those to the total:

2 extra classes * 40 minutes/class = 80 minutes

So, the total number of minutes John spends in class each day is:

240 minutes + 80 minutes = 320 minutes

Now, we calculate the total number of minutes he spends in class over the 5 school days:

320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

Next, we calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on each of these days:

1600 minutes/week * 1/16 = 100 minutes/day

Since he does this on both Saturday and Sunday, we multiply by 2:

100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes

Now, we add the extra learning time to the total weekly class time to get the total time spent learning each week:

1600 minutes/week + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes/week

Finally, we convert the total minutes to hours:

1800 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours/week

"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then apply the 2/3rds ratio again for the second bounce.

First, we determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since each story is 24 feet high and Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, the initial height is:

24 feet/story * 3 stories = 72 feet

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3rds of the initial height:

72 feet * 2/3 = 48 feet

After the second bounce, the ball again reaches 2/3rds of the height it reached after the first bounce:

48 feet * 2/3 = 32 feet

So, on its second bounce, the ball goes up to 32 feet.

"To find the height of the fourth child in inches, we need to convert the heights of the other children to inches and then use the given relationships to determine the height of the fourth child.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.
2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.
3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.
4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The height of the fourth child is 72 inches.

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to calculate the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

First, we determine the number of bags sold:
2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Next, we calculate the earnings:
200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left, because the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex.

2. The 540 kilograms is what was left after the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, before the T-Rex ate, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops.

Therefore, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To find out how much it will cost to paint the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are needed, and finally, calculate the total cost.

First, let's calculate the area of the north and south walls:
2 walls * 10 feet * 8 feet = 160 square feet

Next, the area of the east and west walls:
2 walls * 5 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet

Now, let's add the areas together to get the total area to be painted:
160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so we need to find out how many gallons are required:
240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons

Finally, we calculate the total cost:
12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144

The total cost to paint the room is:
$144"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of picking a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there are 12 sodas in total, with 3 of them being shaken. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas (3 shaken and 8 unshaken). Ellen's brother then takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 10 sodas in total (2 shaken and 8 unshaken - 2 = 6 unshaken).

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left, making a total of 8 sodas. The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of sodas
Probability = 2 / 8
Probability = 1 / 4

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Percentage = (1 / 4) * 100
Percentage = 25%

"The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second train is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour. Since they are traveling in opposite directions, their speeds add up when calculating the distance between them.

The distance the first train travels in 3 hours is:
60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

The distance the second train travels in 3 hours is:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

The total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is the sum of the distances they have each traveled:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off (20% of the total days).
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the number of people Billy helps per day.
5. Multiply the number of people helped per day by the number of days he works to get the total number of people helped.

Let's start with step 1:

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

Step 2:

- Billy takes 20% of the days off.
- Days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

Step 3:

- Days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Step 4:

- Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.
- People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.

Step 5:

- Total people helped = People helped per day * Days worked = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the cars and buses could carry.

First, we calculate the number of people the buses could carry:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, we calculate the number of people the cars could carry:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the two numbers together to get the total number of people:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Therefore, the total number of people who could have been inside the church is 480.

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
Length = 300 feet
Speed = 60 feet/minute
Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Length = 240 feet
Speed = 80 feet/minute
Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

The difference in time:
Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge of $85.00.
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item, which is $15.00.
3. Calculate the discounted price of the frying pan, which is 20% off $20.00.
4. Calculate the discounted price of the set of towels, which is 10% off $30.00.
5. Add the discounted prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. After return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. Frying pan discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Frying pan price after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
4. Towels discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Towels price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To find Caroline's age, we first need to determine Ben's age based on Chris's age, and then we can find Caroline's age based on Ben's age.

Given that Chris is 4 years old and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben is 8 years old, we can calculate Caroline's age, as she is three times older than Ben:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

So, Caroline is 24 years old.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for a 20-year retirement, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   40% of her current annual salary is $100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000 per year.

2. Calculate the total amount needed for 20 years of retirement:
   $40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000.

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves from each paycheck:
   She saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 per year.

4. Determine how many years it will take to save the total amount needed:
   Total amount needed / Amount saved per year = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for a 20-year retirement at 40% of her current annual salary.

"To find the length of each final cut, we first need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of initial cuts, and then divide that result by the number of secondary cuts.

1. Divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of initial equal parts (4):
   100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

2. Now, each of these 25 cm parts must be divided into 5 equal parts:
   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"If 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can find the total population of the school by using the following calculation:

Let \( P \) be the total population of the school. Then, 40% of \( P \) is equal to 240 boys.

\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

This means the total population of the school is 600 students. If 40% are boys, then 60% are girls because the total must add up to 100%.

To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:

\[ 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

So, there are 360 girls in the school.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in June.
2. Calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike each day.
3. Calculate the total number of miles Soledad will hike in June based on her current plan.
4. Determine the difference between her goal and the total miles she will hike based on her current plan.
5. Calculate how many more miles per day she needs to hike to make up the difference.

Let's go through these steps:

1. June has 30 days.
2. Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.
3. Based on her current plan, she will hike 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles in June.
4. The difference between her goal and her current plan is 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles.
5. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we divide the difference by the number of days in June: 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles per day.

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her 9,300-mile journey on time.

"To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the one-way distance to his parents' house.
2. Double that distance to account for the round trip.
3. Multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits per month.

Step 1: One-way distance
Since it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents' house at a speed of 70 mph, we can calculate the one-way distance using the formula:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

Step 2: Round trip distance
The round trip distance is twice the one-way distance:
Round trip distance = 140 miles × 2 = 280 miles

Step 3: Monthly distance
John visits his parents twice a month, so the total monthly distance is:
Monthly distance = Round trip distance × Number of visits per month
Monthly distance = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents.

"To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can first calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The two workers who produce 6 toys an hour will produce:
2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

The other two workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce:
2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Together, these four workers produce:
120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

The manufacturer needs 400 toys for the order and is short by 20 toys after the 10-hour shift, which means they have produced:
400 toys - 20 toys = 380 toys

Since the four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the difference:
380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys

The fifth worker produced 180 toys over the 10-hour shift, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour

Now we can solve for V:

V = 14 / 2
V = 7

This means that Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find out how old Vince is now, we add 2 years to his age from two years ago:

Vince's current age = V + 2
Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call the number of eggs each of them painted ""A"".
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's call the number of eggs Camden painted ""C"" and the number of eggs Sarah painted ""S"".
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so we can write that as C = S + 12.
4. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, so we can write that as A + A + C + S = 56, or 2A + C + S = 56.

Now we can substitute the value of C from step 3 into the equation from step 4:

2A + (S + 12) + S = 56
2A + 2S + 12 = 56
2A + 2S = 56 - 12
2A + 2S = 44
A + S = 22

Since we know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs (C + S = 30), we can substitute C = S + 12 into this equation:

(S + 12) + S = 30
2S + 12 = 30
2S = 30 - 12
2S = 18
S = 9

Now that we know Sarah painted 9 eggs, we can find out how many Camden painted:

C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Now we can find out how many eggs Arnold painted by using the equation A + S = 22:

A + 9 = 22
A = 22 - 9
A = 13

Finally, we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

C - A = 21 - 13
C - A = 8

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons.
2. Determine the number of boxes needed to hold these groups.
3. Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
4. Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
5. Add the weight of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight.
6. Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.

Let's go through each step:

1. Number of groups of 8 crayons:
   200 crayons / 8 crayons per group = 25 groups

2. Number of boxes needed:
   Since each group goes into one box, we need 25 boxes.

3. Total weight of the crayons:
   200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

4. Total weight of the boxes:
   25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

5. Total weight of crayons and boxes:
   200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

6. Convert the total weight to pounds:
   400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Grandma to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk and add it to the 40 minutes she spends on the beach.

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed there is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, so we can calculate her speed on the beach as follows:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk at twice the speed:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{2v} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach to the time spent on the sidewalk to get the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes.

"To find out how many marbles Bob has initially, we can set up an equation based on the information that if he receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let's denote the number of marbles Bob has initially as \( x \).

The equation will be:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To solve for \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, we can find out how many he will have left by subtracting 10 from his initial amount:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the 33-degree water, results in a mixture that is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water, the temperature of the resulting mixture can be calculated using the weighted average of the two temperatures, where the weights are the volumes of water.

The formula for the temperature of the mixture \( T_{mix} \) is:

\[ T_{mix} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_{mix} \) must be at least 40 degrees, so we can set up the inequality:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

Now we solve for \( T \):

\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

\[ T \geq 200 - 132 \]

\[ T \geq 68 \]

So, the water in the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for the mixture to be drinkable by Donny.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the 21 days (3 weeks) and then add those to the initial numbers.

Starting with 50 cows and 20 chickens, we have:

Cows added per day: 20
Chickens added per day: 10
Number of days: 21

Cows after three weeks: 50 (initial) + 20 (daily) * 21 (days)
Chickens after three weeks: 20 (initial) + 10 (daily) * 21 (days)

Let's calculate the total for each:

Cows: 50 + 20 * 21 = 50 + 420 = 470
Chickens: 20 + 10 * 21 = 20 + 210 = 230

Now, we add the cows and chickens together to get the total number of animals:

Total animals: 470 (cows) + 230 (chickens) = 700

"To find the cost per bagel after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount applied, and then divide that total cost by the total number of bagels.

1. Calculate the total cost without the discount:
   4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00

2. Calculate the discount amount:
   10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted total:
   $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

4. Calculate the total number of bagels:
   4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels

5. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to get the cost per bagel:
   $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00/bagel

The cost per bagel after the discount is applied is $1.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So we calculate:

23 scoops - 5 scoops = 18 scoops

Next, we need to determine how many potatoes are used to make a certain number of scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So we calculate:

6 potatoes - 3 potatoes = 3 potatoes
3 scoops - 1 scoop = 2 scoops

This means that 3 potatoes are used to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are used per scoop, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops:

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now we can calculate how many potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying the number of scoops he ate by the number of potatoes per scoop:

18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes per scoop = 27 potatoes

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats and then convert that number into dozens.

First, we calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Next, we calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the following 30 days:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the two amounts to get the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red jellybeans, which is twice the number of green jellybeans.
2. Add the number of green and red jellybeans to find the total number of non-blue jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of non-blue jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Let's do the math:

1. Number of red jellybeans = 2 * number of green jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34
2. Total number of non-blue jellybeans = number of green jellybeans + number of red jellybeans = 17 + 34 = 51
3. Number of blue jellybeans = total number of jellybeans - total number of non-blue jellybeans = 60 - 51 = 9

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold and the number of sunflowers sold as part of the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
- Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each.
- The number of individual sunflowers sold per day is $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each.
- The number of bouquets sold per day is $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.

Now, let's calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:
- Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
- The number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- The total number of sunflowers sold per day is 13 individual sunflowers + 84 sunflowers in bouquets = 97 sunflowers.

First, let's calculate the cost of the devices:
- On Monday, he bought 2 devices at $20 each, so the cost is 2 * $20 = $40.
- On Tuesday, he bought 4 devices at $20 each, so the cost is 4 * $20 = $80.
- The total cost for all devices is $40 + $80 = $120.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the devices:
- He sells each device for twice the amount of the original price, so each device is sold for 2 * $20 = $40.
- He sold a total of 2 + 4 = 6 devices.
- The total revenue from selling all devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

3. Calculate the total number of collections John makes in a week.
4. Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.

Step 1: The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined.
- The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 * 2 = 400 apartments.
- The third complex is 60% bigger, so it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments.
- Therefore, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Step 2: The total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
- The total is 200 (first complex) + 200 (second complex) + 640 (third complex) = 1040 apartments.

Step 3: The total number of collections John makes in a week.
- John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections is 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

Step 4: The total amount of money John makes in a week.

So, the total production over 10 years is the sum of the fruits produced each year:

0 (1st year) + 0 (2nd year) + 0 (3rd year) + 0 (4th year) + 50 (5th year) + 150 (6th year) + 350 (7th year) + 800 (8th year) + 0 (9th year) + 1000 (10th year).

Let's add these numbers together:

0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \), the length of the red rope as \( R \), and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope:
   \( R = 4B \)

2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \( B = Y - 7 \)

3. The combined length of the 3 ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \( R + B + Y = 37 \)

We can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the third equation:

\( 4B + B + Y = 37 \)

Since \( B = Y - 7 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the equation:

\( 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \)

Now, let's solve for \( Y \):

\( 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \)
\( 6Y - 35 = 37 \)
\( 6Y = 72 \)
\( Y = 12 \)

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \):

\( B = Y - 7 \)
\( B = 12 - 7 \)
\( B = 5 \)

Finally, we can find \( R \):

\( R = 4B \)
\( R = 4 \times 5 \)
\( R = 20 \)

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, which means Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \).

3. After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
4. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money, which means \( 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \).

Let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} \]
\[ 15 - x = \frac{60}{5} \]
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister.

5. Ronnie originally had $5 and gave $3 to his little sister, so he is left with \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) dollars.

The amount left in Ronnie's money is:

"The mural is divided into four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. Half of the mural is yellow, which means the remaining half is divided equally among the red, white, and purple paints.

Let's denote the total amount of paint used as \( T \), which is 12 pints. The amount of yellow paint used is half of \( T \), so that's \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints.

The remaining half of the paint, which is also 6 pints, is divided equally among the three other colors. So, the amount of paint for each of the red, white, and purple colors is \( \frac{6}{3} = 2 \) pints.

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then add them all together.

First, we calculate the area of one bedroom:
20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area for the bedrooms is:
240 square feet/bedroom * 4 bedrooms = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:
240 square feet * 5 = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together to get the total area of the house:
960 square feet (bedrooms) + 1200 square feet (living room) + 1000 square feet (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

"To find out how many clouds Alice counted in total from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and then sum them up.

On Monday, she counts 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she counts double the number from Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she counts double the number from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts double the number from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts double the number from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, we add up all the clouds from each day to get the total:

3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 24 (Thursday) + 48 (Friday) = 93

So, the total number of clouds Alice counted from Monday to Friday is 93.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pods in the special size box.
2. Determine the cost per pod in the special size box.
3. Calculate how many pods you can get for $1.
4. Since 1 pod is used per cycle, the number of pods you can get for $1 is the number of cycles you can run.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pods in the special size box.
The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box of 100 pods.
20% of 100 pods is 20 pods.
So, the special size box has 100 pods + 20 pods = 120 pods.

Step 2: Determine the cost per pod in the special size box.
The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods.
The cost per pod is $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod.

Step 3: Calculate how many pods you can get for $1.
Since each pod costs $0.10, for $1 you can get $1 / $0.10 per pod = 10 pods.

Step 4: Since 1 pod is used per cycle, the number of pods you can get for $1 is the number of cycles you can run.
You can run 10 cycles for $1.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he has, we divide $1000 by $20:
   \( \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \) bills.

2. He loses 10 of these $20 bills, so he has:
   \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill, so he uses:
   \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) bills, and he has 20 bills left.

4. The value of the 20 $20 bills he has left is:
   \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \) dollars.

5. Thomas then triples his money, so he has:
   \( 400 \times 3 = 1200 \) dollars.

6. He then converts all his money to $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:
   \( \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \) bills.

So, Thomas has 240 $5 bills.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

Second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, so team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Total goals:
- Team A's total goals = 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.
- Team B's total goals = 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of both teams' goals:
- Total goals = Team A's total goals + Team B's total goals = 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he uses 45% of the chalk, which is:

5 inches * 45% = 5 inches * 0.45 = 2.25 inches

So, by the end of Monday, the chalk is:

5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

Starting from Tuesday, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day. We need to calculate how many days it will take for the chalk to become smaller than 2 inches.

Let's calculate the length of the chalk after each day:

Day 1 (Tuesday):
2.75 inches * (1 - 20%) = 2.75 inches * 0.80 = 2.2 inches

Day 2 (Wednesday):
2.2 inches * (1 - 20%) = 2.2 inches * 0.80 = 1.76 inches

After Wednesday, the chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches, so the teacher will have to recycle the chalk.

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days (Tuesday and Wednesday) before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate how many boys and girls are on varsity.

One-third of the girls are on varsity:
12 girls * 1/3 = 4 girls

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
12 boys * 1/4 = 3 boys

Now, we add the number of boys and girls on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students

The total number of students in the class is:
12 boys + 12 girls = 24 students

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
24 students - 7 students = 17 students

So, the number of students not on varsity is 17.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist works on and then divide that by the total number of teeth James has, and finally multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

Now, to find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of teeth fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of teeth fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of teeth fixed} = 0.5 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of teeth fixed} = 50 \]

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, we have:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
This is because Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.

From the second statement, we have:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]
This is because in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Now we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}C + \frac{35}{3} \]

To solve for \( C \), we'll multiply everything by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, we'll move all terms involving \( C \) to one side and the constants to the other side:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( C \):
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up the 2 apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other one into the tree.
3. Throwing the apple into the tree caused 5 more apples to fall out.
4. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
5. Throwing the apple at the tree caused another 6 apples to fall out.
6. Newton picked up all the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.

Now, let's count the apples:

- After the first event, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket.
- After the second event, he has 1 (from the first event) + 4 (from the 5 that fell, minus the one he threw) = 5 apples in his pocket.
- After the third event, he has 5 (from the previous count) + 6 (from the 6 that fell) = 11 apples in his pocket.

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices her friends will eat:
6 friends * 6 slices each = 36 slices of cheese pizza

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza to find out how many cheese pizzas are needed:
36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices her friends will eat:
6 friends * 4 slices each = 24 slices of pepperoni pizza

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza to find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed:
24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas

Now, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 6 pizza pies.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour and then determine how long it will take him to reach 60 snowballs.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 sets of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs will melt 4 times in an hour, which is a total of 8 snowballs melted in an hour.

So, the net number of snowballs Jay can make in an hour is:
20 (built) - 8 (melted) = 12 snowballs per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to make 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour.

60 snowballs / 12 snowballs per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

2. John's age when Digimon came out: 28 - 20 = 8 years old.
3. At that time, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim must have been 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
2. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages, and used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages used and received over the three days:

- Total bandages used: 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) + 25 (third day) = 91 bandages.
- Total bandages received: 50 (first day) + 100 (third day) = 150 bandages.

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. This means that the number of bandages they started with plus the bandages they received minus the bandages they used should equal 78.

Let's denote the number of bandages they started with as X. Then we can set up the following equation:

X (starting bandages) + 150 (received) - 91 (used) = 78 (left)

Now we can solve for X:

X + 150 - 91 = 78
X + 59 = 78
X = 78 - 59
X = 19

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her regular earnings and the additional attendance bonus.

First, we calculate her regular earnings:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings are:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * $1.5/hour = 67.5 hours/week * $1.5/hour = $101.25/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her monthly earnings from her hourly rate are:
$101.25/week * 4 weeks = $405

Additionally, Jen receives a $10 bonus for each week of complete attendance. Since she did not incur any absences for the entire month, she receives this bonus for all 4 weeks:
$10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Now, we add her regular earnings to her attendance bonus to find her total earnings for April:
$405 + $40 = $445

Jen will receive $445 in April.

"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the amount he earns for each task by the number of times he completed the task and then add all the amounts together.

For doing his laundry once, he earns $3.00.
For cleaning his room once, he earns $1.50.
For taking the trash out twice, he earns $0.75 per time, so $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.
For emptying the dishwasher 6 times, he earns $0.50 per time, so $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, we add all the amounts together:

"First, let's calculate the cost per bottle of scotch:

Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost of scotch / Number of bottles of scotch
Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 / 10
Cost per bottle of scotch = $60

Next, we'll determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys:

Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * Number of bottles of scotch
Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * 10
Number of bottles of cognac = 20

Now, let's find the cost per bottle of cognac, which is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch:

Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch + (50% of Cost per bottle of scotch)
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + (0.5 * $60)
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + $30
Cost per bottle of cognac = $90

Now we can calculate the total cost of the cognac:

Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles of cognac * Cost per bottle of cognac
Total cost of cognac = 20 * $90
Total cost of cognac = $1800

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount spent:

Total amount spent = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
Total amount spent = $600 + $1800
Total amount spent = $2400

"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which means he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees planted on the second day is 10.

For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than the first day. So, he planted an additional 40 * 1/4 = 10 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day, making the total for the second day 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

The total number of White Oak trees planted over the two days is 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30 trees.

The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days is 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 trees.

\[ 4m = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4m = 32 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4:

\[ m = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ m = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

"To find out how many fish have red stripes and blue stripes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
2. Subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total to find the number of remaining fish.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes to get the total.

Let's start with step 1:

1. One-third of the fish have red stripes, so we calculate:
   \( \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \) fish have red stripes.

Now, step 2:

2. Subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total:
   \( 66 - 22 = 44 \) fish remain.

For step 3:

3. Five-elevenths of the remaining fish have blue stripes, so we calculate:
   \( \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \) fish have blue stripes.

Finally, step 4:

4. Add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes:
   \( 22 + 20 = 42 \) fish have either red stripes or blue stripes.

The final numerical answer is:
42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.
2. She also had three makeup sets with six eyeshadow colors each, so that's 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.
3. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so Amy loses 4 colors, leaving her with 8 - 4 = 4 colors from the remaining palette.
4. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, so she uses 6 / 2 = 3 colors from that set.
5. After using up 3 colors from one makeup set, she has 6 - 3 = 3 colors left from that set.
6. The other two makeup sets are untouched, so she still has 2 * 6 = 12 colors from those sets.
7. Adding up all the colors she has left, we get 4 (from the palette) + 3 (from the used makeup set) + 12 (from the other two makeup sets) = 19 colors.

So, Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find out how high the roof is from the second floor's floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of the house.
2. Calculate the height of the first floor.
3. Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof.

Step 1: Total height of the house
Mattison's height is 60 inches, and the house is 7 times as high as he is.
Total height of the house = 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches

Step 2: Height of the first floor
The first floor is thrice as high as Mattison.
Height of the first floor = 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches

Step 3: Height from the second floor's floor to the roof
Height from the second floor's floor to the roof = Total height of the house - Height of the first floor
Height from the second floor's floor to the roof = 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches

"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found:

40% of 700 shells = 0.40 * 700 = 280 shells

Now, we subtract the shells found by team Alphas from the total to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams:

700 shells - 280 shells = 420 shells

Next, we calculate how many shells team The finders found, which is 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

60% of 420 shells = 0.60 * 420 = 252 shells

Finally, we subtract the shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells to find out how many shells team Gogetters found:

420 shells - 252 shells = 168 shells

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance the dogs need to walk per day.

The average distance for the 4 dogs is 3 miles per day. This means the total distance for all 4 dogs combined is 4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles.

We already know the distance the first three dogs need to walk:
- The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
- The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
- The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

The total distance for the first three dogs is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance the first three dogs need to walk from the total distance for all four dogs:
12 miles (total for all dogs) - 8 miles (total for the first three dogs) = 4 miles.

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"John's house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that value. 

First, we calculate the loan amount:
$250,000 * 40% = $250,000 * 0.40 = $100,000

Next, we calculate the amount he uses to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan:
$100,000 * 60% = $100,000 * 0.60 = $60,000

To find out how much money he has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the debt payment from the total loan amount:
$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, the amount of money John has leftover after paying his debts is:

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

The selling price is 11/8 of the buying price. If the buying price is $72, then the selling price is:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's calculate the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27.

"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. On the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Over 3 days, it would remove:
   1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters

2. On the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much as the low setting, which is 2 liters per day. Over 3 days, it would remove:
   2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters

3. On the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much as the medium setting, which is 4 liters per day. Over 5 days, it would remove:
   4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Now, we add up the total amount of water removed:
3 liters (low setting) + 6 liters (medium setting) + 20 liters (high setting) = 29 liters

The total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters.

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the total capacity of Ali's school and John's school and then add them together.

Ali's school has one class with a capacity of 120 students.

John's school has two classes, each with a capacity of 1/8 of Ali's class. So, the capacity of each of John's classes is:
120 students / 8 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for his school is:
15 students/class * 2 classes = 30 students

Now, we add the capacities of both schools together:
120 students (Ali's school) + 30 students (John's school) = 150 students

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the total amount he owes including the interest, and then subtract the amount he has already paid over the 11 months.

First, let's calculate the interest on the $300 that Stephen borrowed. The interest is 2% of $300.

Interest = 2% of $300
Interest = 0.02 * $300
Interest = $6

So, the total amount Stephen owes is the original $300 plus the $6 interest, which is $306.

Next, we need to calculate how much Stephen has paid over the 11 months. He pays $25 per month.

Total paid over 11 months = 11 * $25
Total paid over 11 months = $275

Now, we subtract the total amount paid over 11 months from the total amount owed to find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.

Amount to pay in the twelfth month = Total amount owed - Total paid over 11 months
Amount to pay in the twelfth month = $306 - $275
Amount to pay in the twelfth month = $31

So, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the total number of jelly beans he estimated to be in the jar and then find out how many of those he estimated to be red. We can then compare his estimate of the number of red jelly beans to the true number, which is 900.

First, we calculate the volume of the jar:
Volume of the jar = base area * height
Volume of the jar = 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches
Volume of the jar = 36 * 15
Volume of the jar = 540 cubic inches

Next, we calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans, taking into account the 80% packing efficiency:
Effective volume = volume of the jar * packing efficiency
Effective volume = 540 cubic inches * 0.80
Effective volume = 432 cubic inches

Now, we calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar based on the effective volume and the volume of a single jelly bean:
Total number of jelly beans = effective volume / volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
Estimated number of red jelly beans = total number of jelly beans * 30%
Estimated number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.30
Estimated number of red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900, so we can now calculate how far off Tim's guess was:
Difference = true number of red jelly beans - estimated number of red jelly beans
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bus departed Chengli city with 20 people.
2. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, so the total number of people on the bus is now 20 + 40 = 60.
3. On the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. That's 3/4 * 40 = 30 people.
4. After the second stop, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.
5. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, so the total number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 200 - 180 = 20.

"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits for 5 years.
   - Total cost before the increase = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years.

2. **After the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit has increased by 150%.
   - The new cost of one visit = $2 + ($2 * 150%) = $2 + $3 = $5.
   - She continues to visit 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total cost after the increase = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for both periods and sum them up.

**Before the increase:**
3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = 3 * 2 * 5 = $30.

**After the increase:**
3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = 3 * 5 * 3 = $45.

**Total cost:**
$30 (before) + $45 (after) = $75.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it will take for all the students to go through the escape room, given that only 8 students can try it at a time and each session lasts 45 minutes.

First, let's determine the total number of students who will be trying the escape room. There are 10 students from each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th), so:

10 students/grade * 4 grades = 40 students

Now, we need to figure out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students:

40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups

Since each group takes 45 minutes to complete the escape room, we multiply the number of groups by the time each group takes:

5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for all the students to try the escape room.

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 5x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

The length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The longer piece is 4 times this length:

"To find out how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of ground beef are needed for 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the number of pounds of ground beef.

Step 1: Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs he wants to make by the number of meatballs per pound to find out how many pounds of ground beef he needs.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Step 2: Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. So, we multiply the number of pounds of ground beef by the amount of seasoning per pound.

5 pounds of ground beef * 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( c \).
2. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So the number of brownies \( b \) can be expressed as \( b = 3c - 2 \).
3. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats needed is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).
4. The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies, so \( c + b = 10 \).

Now we can substitute the expression for \( b \) into the equation for the total number of treats:

\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Solving for \( c \):

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:

20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15

So the discount is $15, and the cost after the discount is:

$75 - $15 = $60

Next, we calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails in total (5 on each hand). The cost per nail is $3, so the total cost for the nail art is:

"To find the percentage of the day the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time the custodian has to clean in minutes over 5 days.
2. Calculate the total time the custodian spends cleaning per day.
3. Calculate the total time the custodian works in a day in minutes.
4. Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

Step 1: Total time to clean all classrooms
- There are 80 classrooms and it takes 15 minutes to clean each one.
- Total cleaning time = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Step 2: Total time spent cleaning per day
- The custodian has 5 days to clean all the classrooms.
- Cleaning time per day = Total cleaning time / 5 days = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day

Step 3: Total work time in a day
- The custodian works an 8-hour day.
- Work time in minutes = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

Step 4: Percentage of the day spent cleaning
- Percentage of day spent cleaning = (Cleaning time per day / Work time in a day) * 100
- Percentage of day spent cleaning = (240 minutes/day / 480 minutes/day) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

The custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold.

Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so together they can hold:
2 shelves * 10 books/shelf = 20 books

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold:
2 * 10 books = 20 books

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold:
20 books - 5 books = 15 books

Now, we add up the total number of books that one bookcase can hold:
20 books (middle shelves) + 20 books (bottom shelf) + 15 books (top shelf) = 55 books

Elly has 110 books in total. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:
110 books / 55 books/bookcase = 2 bookcases

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To calculate Rose's profit, we need to determine her total cost and her total revenue, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, we calculate the total cost of the eggs:
- Rose bought five dozens of eggs.
- Each dozen costs $2.40.
- Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so five dozens equal 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.
- Rose sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for 3 eggs.
- To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell, we divide the total number of eggs by 3: 60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets.
- Total revenue = 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

Rose's profit is $8.00.

"To find out how many white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red hats, which is half of the total number of hats.
2. Subtract the number of red hats from the total to find out how many hats are not red.
3. Calculate the number of blue hats, which is 3/5 of the remaining hats after the red ones are taken out.
4. Subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find out how many are white.

Let's do the math:

1. Number of red hats: 100 / 2 = 50
2. Remaining hats after red: 100 - 50 = 50
3. Number of blue hats: 3/5 * 50 = 30
4. Number of white hats: 50 - 30 = 20

So, Skyler has 20 white hats.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests, and then subtract the number of questions she already got right on the first test.

First, let's find out the total number of questions across both tests:
70 questions (first test) + 40 questions (second test) = 110 questions (total)

Next, we calculate 70% of the total questions to find out how many she needs to answer correctly to pass:
70% of 110 questions = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions

Now, we know that Audrey got 60% of the 70 questions correct on the first test:
60% of 70 questions = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions

To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly:
77 questions (needed to pass) - 42 questions (correct on the first test) = 35 questions

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

"To find out the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights:
- There is 1 flashlight for each of the 4 people living in the house.
- There are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms.

So the total number of flashlights is:
4 (for the people) + (2 * 8) (for the rooms) = 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles:
- There are 4 small candles for half the rooms, which is 4 rooms (8 rooms / 2).
- There are 5 medium candles for the other half of the rooms, which is also 4 rooms.

So the total number of candles is:
(4 small candles * 4 rooms) + (5 medium candles * 4 rooms) = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and candles together to get the total:
20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56 items.

"To solve this, let's break down the time it takes for each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they each take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so they each take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.
- The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any additional time.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 0 minutes (since it's completed with the fifth side)

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 0 = 30 minutes

"To find out how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes Tim spends at work each day.
2. Determine how many calls he can handle in one day.
3. Multiply the number of calls he handles in one day by the number of workdays in a week.

Step 1: Tim spends 6 hours each day at work. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
6 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

Step 2: It takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with a call, so the number of calls he can handle in one day is:
360 minutes/day / 15 minutes/call = 24 calls/day

Step 3: Tim works 5 days a week, so the total number of calls he handles in a week is:
24 calls/day * 5 days/week = 120 calls/week

Therefore, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the total drying time for both varnishes and then find the difference.

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, it would take 7 minutes * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, it would take 12 minutes * 6 = 72 minutes.

The difference in drying time between the new and old varnish for 6 paintings is:
- 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break it down as follows:

- 4 plants need half a cup of water each, so 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water.
- 8 plants need 1 cup of water each, so 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water.
- The rest of the plants (20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants) need a quarter of a cup of water each, so 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water.

Now, we add up all the water needed:

2 (from the half-cup plants) + 8 (from the one-cup plants) + 2 (from the quarter-cup plants) = 12 cups of water.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Phineas Frog to travel half the distance on land and the other half in water.

The total distance Phineas needs to travel is 200 yards. Half of this distance is on land, and the other half is in water. So, each half is:

200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

On land, Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. The time it takes to travel 100 yards on land is:

100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

In water, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. The time it takes to travel 100 yards in water is:

100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

The total time to travel the entire distance is the sum of the time on land and in water:

5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June from selling all the doughnuts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made per day.
2. Determine the total revenue per day from selling the doughnuts.
3. Calculate the number of days in June.
4. Multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in June to get the total revenue for June.

Step 1: Total number of doughnuts made per day
Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen, the total number of doughnuts made per day is:
10 dozen/day * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Step 2: Total revenue per day
Each doughnut is sold for $2, so the revenue per day is:
120 doughnuts/day * $2/doughnut = $240/day

Step 3: Number of days in June
June has 30 days.

Step 4: Total revenue for June
The total revenue for June is the daily revenue multiplied by the number of days in June:

"To find out how long it would take John to speak 10 pages after his training, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
2. Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.
3. Calculate the time it would take to speak those words at the new speed.

Step 1: John's new speaking speed
John's new speed is 2.5 times his starting speed of 150 WPM.
New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Step 2: Total number of words in 10 pages
Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages would have:
Total words = 450 words/page * 10 pages = 4500 words

Step 3: Time to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM
Time (in minutes) = Total words / Speed in WPM

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the following 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so it's 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, we add up all the kernels that popped:

20 (first 30 seconds) + 60 (second 30 seconds) + 80 (third 30 seconds) + 40 (fourth 30 seconds) + 10 (after heat) = 210

So, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim will need, we need to calculate the amount of lemon juice required for the pool party and for the extra gallon that Allen requested.

For the pool party:
- 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
- Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
- Therefore, 4 gallons of lemonade will require 4 cups of lemon juice.

For Allen's extra gallon:
- Allen wants a gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will require 2 cups of lemon juice.

In total:
- 4 gallons for the party + 1 gallon for Allen = 5 gallons of lemonade.
- 4 cups for the party + 2 cups for Allen = 6 cups of lemon juice.

"To find out how much the boat is worth after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the value at the end of each year.

1. After the first year, the boat depreciates by 30%. The value of the boat at the end of the first year is:
   \( 9000 - (9000 \times 0.30) = 9000 \times (1 - 0.30) = 9000 \times 0.70 \)

2. After the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30%. The value of the boat at the end of the second year is:
   \( (9000 \times 0.70) - (9000 \times 0.70 \times 0.30) = 9000 \times 0.70 \times (1 - 0.30) = 9000 \times 0.70 \times 0.70 \)

3. After the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%. The value of the boat at the end of the third year is:
   \( (9000 \times 0.70 \times 0.70) - (9000 \times 0.70 \times 0.70 \times 0.20) = 9000 \times 0.70 \times 0.70 \times (1 - 0.20) = 9000 \times 0.70 \times 0.70 \times 0.80 \)

Now, let's calculate the final value:

\( 9000 \times 0.70 \times 0.70 \times 0.80 \)

\( 9000 \times 0.70 = 6300 \) (value after the first year)

\( 6300 \times 0.70 = 4410 \) (value after the second year)

"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stays and the cost of the bus rides, and then add them together.

The cost of one night at the hotel is $80. Since Helen stayed for 3 nights, the total cost for the hotel is:
3 nights * $80/night = $240

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, the cost of one bus trip is:
10% of $80 = 0.10 * $80 = $8

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus rides is:
7 rides * $8/ride = $56

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus rides to find the total amount Helen paid:
$240 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $296

"To calculate the force John needs to push the car, we need to find the total weight of the car including the luggage and the children, and then calculate 1% of that total weight.

The total weight is the sum of the car's weight, the luggage's weight, and the children's weight:

Car's weight: 1200 pounds
Luggage's weight: 250 pounds
Children's weight: 75 pounds each, so for two children: 75 * 2 = 150 pounds

Total weight = Car's weight + Luggage's weight + Children's weight
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Now, we calculate 1% of the total weight to find the force needed:

Force needed = 1% of Total weight
Force needed = 0.01 * 1600
Force needed = 16 pounds

"To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

P = 2 * (length + width)

Given that the length (long side) of the fence is 20 feet and the width (short side) is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2 * (20 + 15)
P = 2 * 35
P = 70

James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper to hang it along the entire perimeter of his backyard fence.

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and 16 years younger than Emma, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16 years
Emma's age = 40 years + 16 years
Emma's age = 56 years

Now that we have both ages, we can calculate the average:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 years + 56 years) / 2
Average age = 96 years / 2
Average age = 48 years

"To find out how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in that time.

First, we calculate the daily feed consumption for one pig:
4 pounds of feed * 2 times a day = 8 pounds of feed per day for one pig.

Next, we calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:
8 pounds of feed per day * 5 pigs = 40 pounds of feed per day for all pigs.

Now, we calculate the weekly feed consumption for all five pigs:
40 pounds of feed per day * 7 days = 280 pounds of feed per week for all pigs.

Finally, we subtract the weekly feed consumption from the total amount of feed Dexter ordered:
300 pounds of feed - 280 pounds of feed = 20 pounds of feed left after a week.

"To find out how much time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week she meditates for 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, she will meditate for 210 minutes * 4 = 840 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week, so that's 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours per week.
- In 4 weeks, she will practice yoga for 5 hours * 4 = 20 hours.

Now, we need to convert the hours of yoga into minutes to add it to the meditation time:
- 20 hours of yoga is equal to 20 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1200 minutes.

Finally, we add the time spent on meditation and yoga:
- 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes.

So, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent 2040 minutes on meditation and yoga practice.

1. Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer.
2. Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne.
3. Anne is twice the size of Albert.
4. Albert is 36 inches tall.

First, we find Anne's height:
Anne's height = 2 * Albert's height
Anne's height = 2 * 36 inches
Anne's height = 72 inches

Now, we know Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne:
Jackie's current height = Anne's height - 2 inches
Jackie's current height = 72 inches - 2 inches
Jackie's current height = 70 inches

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so to find her height before the summer, we subtract 3 inches from her current height:
Jackie's height before summer = Jackie's current height - 3 inches
Jackie's height before summer = 70 inches - 3 inches
Jackie's height before summer = 67 inches

The first T-shirt is at the original price of $8.
The second T-shirt is at 50% off, so it costs $8 * 50% = $4.

The total cost for the two T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes with the 40% discount.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is $40 * 40% = $16.
So, the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends.

Total amount spent = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes

- Cost of jackfruit per jar: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Cost of honey per jar: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Total cost per jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 10 jars:

Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:

2. Next, we need to determine the net number of holes filled by Nate each day after he returns.
   - Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night.
   - Net holes filled per day = 9 holes/day - 6 holes/night = 3 holes/day.

3. Now, we can calculate how many days it will take Nate to fill in all the holes.
   - Total holes to fill = 84 holes.
   - Days to fill all holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day = 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

4. Finally, we need to convert the number of days into weeks.

First, we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, Aaron ran 2 miles.

Next, we know that Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means that if Aaron took 16 minutes to run 2 miles, it would take him 8 minutes to run 1 mile (16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile).

Since Vanessa runs each mile at half the speed of Aaron, it would take her 16 minutes to run 1 mile (8 minutes per mile * 2 = 16 minutes per mile).

Now, to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles, we multiply the time it takes her to run 1 mile by the number of miles she ran:

16 minutes per mile * 4 miles = 64 minutes

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

Total selling price = 1.25 * $80
Total selling price = $100

Now, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

The mechanic charges $50 per hour for 3 hours, so the labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's say:
- \( c \) is the number of chickens,
- \( k \) is the number of cows.

We know that:
1. The total number of animals (chickens and cows) is 20, so \( c + k = 20 \).
2. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70, so \( 2c + 4k = 70 \).

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( c \) and \( k \).

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know there are 15 cows, we can substitute \( k \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to calculate the total number of slices and then divide that number by the number of people.

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person gets, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:
56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

So, each person can have 14 slices.
